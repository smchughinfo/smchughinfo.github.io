entitled UNMANNED DEVICE UTILIZATION METHODS AND SYSTEMS, naming Royce A. Levien, Richard T. Lord, Robert W. Lord, Mark A. Malamud, John D. Rinaldo, Jr., and Lowell L. Wood, Jr., as inventors, filed 17 Jul.  2012, each of which was filed within the
twelve months preceding the filing date of the present application or is an application of which a currently co-pending application is entitled to the benefit of the filing date.
<BR><BR> The United States Patent Office (USPTO) has published a notice to the effect that the USPTO's computer programs require that patent applicants reference both a serial number and indicate whether an application is a continuation,
continuation-in-part, or divisional of a parent application.  Stephen G. Kunin, Benefit of Prior-Filed Application, USPTO Official Gazette Mar.  18, 2003.  The present Applicant Entity (hereinafter "Applicant") has provided above a specific reference to
the application(s) from which priority is being claimed as recited by statute.  Applicant understands that the statute is unambiguous in its specific reference language and does not require either a serial number or any characterization, such as
"continuation" or "continuation-in-part," for claiming priority to U.S.  patent applications.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Applicant understands that the USPTO's computer programs have certain data entry requirements, and hence Applicant has provided
designation(s) of a relationship between the present application and its parent application(s) as set forth above, but expressly points out that such designation(s) are not to be construed in any way as any type of commentary and/or admission as to
whether or not the present application contains any new matter in addition to the matter of its parent application(s).
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR> The claims, description, and drawings of this application may describe one or more of the instant technologies in operational/functional language, for example as a set of operations to be performed by a computer.  Such operational/functional
description in most instances would be understood by one skilled the art as specifically-configured hardware (e.g., because a general purpose computer in effect becomes a special purpose computer once it is programmed to perform particular functions
pursuant to instructions from program software).
<BR><BR> Importantly, although the operational/functional descriptions described herein are understandable by the human mind, they are not abstract ideas of the operations/functions divorced from computational implementation of those
operations/functions.  Rather, the operations/functions represent a specification for the massively complex computational machines or other means.  As discussed in detail below, the operational/functional language must be read in its proper technological
context, i.e., as concrete specifications for physical implementations.
<BR><BR> The logical operations/functions described herein are a distillation of machine specifications or other physical mechanisms specified by the operations/functions such that the otherwise inscrutable machine specifications may be comprehensible to
the human mind.  The distillation also allows one of skill in the art to adapt the operational/functional description of the technology across many different specific vendors' hardware configurations or platforms, without being limited to specific
vendors' hardware configurations or platforms.
<BR><BR> Some of the present technical description (e.g., detailed description, drawings, claims, etc.) may be set forth in terms of logical operations/functions.  As described in more detail in the following paragraphs, these logical
operations/functions are not representations of abstract ideas, but rather representative of static or sequenced specifications of various hardware elements.  Differently stated, unless context dictates otherwise, the logical operations/functions will be
understood by those of skill in the art to be representative of static or sequenced specifications of various hardware elements.  This is true because tools available to one of skill in the art to implement technical disclosures set forth in
operational/functional formats--tools in the form of a high-level programming language (e.g., C, java, visual basic), etc.), or tools in the form of Very high speed Hardware Description Language ("VHDL," which is a language that uses text to describe
logic circuits)--are generators of static or sequenced specifications of various hardware configurations.  This fact is sometimes obscured by the broad term "software," but, as shown by the following explanation, those skilled in the art understand that
what is termed "software" is a shorthand for a massively complex interchaining/specification of ordered-matter elements.  The term "ordered-matter elements" may refer to physical components of computation, such as assemblies of electronic logic gates,
molecular computing logic constituents, quantum computing mechanisms, etc.
<BR><BR> For example, a high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction, e.g., multiple levels of abstraction, from the details of the sequential organizations, states, inputs, outputs, etc., of the machines that a
high-level programming language actually specifies.  See, e.g., Wikipedia, High-level programming language, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language (as of Jun.  5, 2012, 21:00 GMT).  In order to facilitate human comprehension, in
many instances, high-level programming languages resemble or even share symbols with natural languages.  See, e.g., Wikipedia, Natural language, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language (as of Jun.  5, 2012, 21:00 GMT).
<BR><BR> It has been argued that because high-level programming languages use strong abstraction (e.g., that they may resemble or share symbols with natural languages), they are therefore a "purely mental construct." (e.g., that "software"--a computer
program or computer programming--is somehow an ineffable mental construct, because at a high level of abstraction, it can be conceived and understood in the human mind).  This argument has been used to characterize technical description in the form of
functions/operations as somehow "abstract ideas." In fact, in technological arts (e.g., the information and communication technologies) this is not true.
<BR><BR> The fact that high-level programming languages use strong abstraction to facilitate human understanding should not be taken as an indication that what is expressed is an abstract idea.  In fact, those skilled in the art understand that just the
opposite is true.  If a high-level programming language is the tool used to implement a technical disclosure in the form of functions/operations, those skilled in the art will recognize that, far from being abstract, imprecise, "fuzzy," or "mental" in
any significant semantic sense, such a tool is instead a near incomprehensibly precise sequential specification of specific computational machines--the parts of which are built up by activating/selecting such parts from typically more general
computational machines over time (e.g., clocked time).  This fact is sometimes obscured by the superficial similarities between high-level programming languages and natural languages.  These superficial similarities also may cause a glossing over of the
fact that high-level programming language implementations ultimately perform valuable work by creating/controlling many different computational machines.
<BR><BR> The many different computational machines that a high-level programming language specifies are almost unimaginably complex.  At base, the hardware used in the computational machines typically consists of some type of ordered matter (e.g.,
traditional electronic devices (e.g., transistors), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), quantum devices, mechanical switches, optics, fluidics, pneumatics, optical devices (e.g., optical interference devices), molecules, etc.) that are arranged to form logic
gates.  Logic gates are typically physical devices that may be electrically, mechanically, chemically, or otherwise driven to change physical state in order to create a physical reality of Boolean logic.
<BR><BR> Logic gates may be arranged to form logic circuits, which are typically physical devices that may be electrically, mechanically, chemically, or otherwise driven to create a physical reality of certain logical functions.  Types of logic circuits
include such devices as multiplexers, registers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), computer memory, etc., each type of which may be combined to form yet other types of physical devices, such as a central processing unit (CPU)--the best known of which is the
microprocessor.  A modern microprocessor will often contain more than one hundred million logic gates in its many logic circuits (and often more than a billion transistors).  See, e.g., Wikipedia, Logic gates, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gates (as
of Jun.  5, 2012, 21:03 GMT).
<BR><BR> The logic circuits forming the microprocessor are arranged to provide a microarchitecture that will carry out the instructions defined by that microprocessor's defined Instruction Set Architecture.  The Instruction Set Architecture is the part
of the microprocessor architecture related to programming, including the native data types, instructions, registers, addressing modes, memory architecture, interrupt and exception handling, and external Input/Output.  See, e.g., Wikipedia, Computer
architecture, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture (as of Jun.  5, 2012, 21:03 GMT).
<BR><BR> The Instruction Set Architecture includes a specification of the machine language that can be used by programmers to use/control the microprocessor.  Since the machine language instructions are such that they may be executed directly by the
microprocessor, typically they consist of strings of binary digits, or bits.  For example, a typical machine language instruction might be many bits long (e.g., 32, 64, or 128 bit strings are currently common).  A typical machine language instruction
might take the form "11110000101011110000111100111111" (a 32 bit instruction).
<BR><BR> It is significant here that, although the machine language instructions are written as sequences of binary digits, in actuality those binary digits specify physical reality.  For example, if certain semiconductors are used to make the operations
of Boolean logic a physical reality, the apparently mathematical bits "1" and "0" in a machine language instruction actually constitute a shorthand that specifies the application of specific voltages to specific wires.  For example, in some semiconductor
technologies, the binary number "1" (e.g., logical "1") in a machine language instruction specifies around +5 volts applied to a specific "wire" (e.g., metallic traces on a printed circuit board) and the binary number "0" (e.g., logical "0") in a machine
language instruction specifies around -5 volts applied to a specific "wire." In addition to specifying voltages of the machines' configuration, such machine language instructions also select out and activate specific groupings of logic gates from the
millions of logic gates of the more general machine.  Thus, far from abstract mathematical expressions, machine language instruction programs, even though written as a string of zeros and ones, specify many, many constructed physical machines or physical
machine states.
<BR><BR> Machine language is typically incomprehensible by most humans (e.g., the above example was just ONE instruction, and some personal computers execute more than two billion instructions every second).  See, e.g., Wikipedia, Instructions per
second, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_second (as of Jun.  5, 2012, 21:04 GMT).
<BR><BR> Thus, programs written in machine language--which may be tens of millions of machine language instructions long--are incomprehensible.  In view of this, early assembly languages were developed that used mnemonic codes to refer to machine
language instructions, rather than using the machine language instructions' numeric values directly (e.g., for performing a multiplication operation, programmers coded the abbreviation "mult," which represents the binary number "011000" in MIPS machine
code).  While assembly languages were initially a great aid to humans controlling the microprocessors to perform work, in time the complexity of the work that needed to be done by the humans outstripped the ability of humans to control the
microprocessors using merely assembly languages.
<BR><BR> At this point, it was noted that the same tasks needed to be done over and over, and the machine language necessary to do those repetitive tasks was the same.  In view of this, compilers were created.  A compiler is a device that takes a
statement that is more comprehensible to a human than either machine or assembly language, such as "add 2+2 and output the result," and translates that human understandable statement into a complicated, tedious, and immense machine language code (e.g.,
millions of 32, 64, or 128 bit length strings).  Compilers thus translate high-level programming language into machine language.
<BR><BR> This compiled machine language, as described above, is then used as the technical specification which sequentially constructs and causes the interoperation of many different computational machines such that humanly useful, tangible, and concrete
work is done.  For example, as indicated above, such machine language--the compiled version of the higher-level language--functions as a technical specification which selects out hardware logic gates, specifies voltage levels, voltage transition timings,
etc., such that the humanly useful work is accomplished by the hardware.
<BR><BR> Thus, a functional/operational technical description, when viewed by one of skill in the art, is far from an abstract idea.  Rather, such a functional/operational technical description, when understood through the tools available in the art such
as those just described, is instead understood to be a humanly understandable representation of a hardware specification, the complexity and specificity of which far exceeds the comprehension of most any one human.  With this in mind, those skilled in
the art will understand that any such operational/functional technical descriptions--in view of the disclosures herein and the knowledge of those skilled in the art--may be understood as operations made into physical reality by (a) one or more
interchained physical machines, (b) interchained logic gates configured to create one or more physical machine(s) representative of sequential/combinatorial logic(s), (c) interchained ordered matter making up logic gates (e.g., interchained electronic
devices (e.g., transistors), DNA, quantum devices, mechanical switches, optics, fluidics, pneumatics, molecules, etc.) that create physical reality representative of logic(s), or (d) virtually any combination of the foregoing.  Indeed, any physical
object which has a stable, measurable, and changeable state may be used to construct a machine based on the above technical description.  Charles Babbage, for example, constructed the first computer out of wood and powered by cranking a handle.
<BR><BR> Thus, far from being understood as an abstract idea, those skilled in the art will recognize a functional/operational technical description as a humanly-understandable representation of one or more almost unimaginably complex and time sequenced
hardware instantiations.  The fact that functional/operational technical descriptions might lend themselves readily to high-level computing languages (or high-level block diagrams for that matter) that share some words, structures, phrases, etc. with
natural language simply cannot be taken as an indication that such functional/operational technical descriptions are abstract ideas, or mere expressions of abstract ideas.  In fact, as outlined herein, in the technological arts this is simply not true. 
When viewed through the tools available to those of skill in the art, such functional/operational technical descriptions are seen as specifying hardware configurations of almost unimaginable complexity.
<BR><BR> As outlined above, the reason for the use of functional/operational technical descriptions is at least twofold.  First, the use of functional/operational technical descriptions allows near-infinitely complex machines and machine operations
arising from interchained hardware elements to be described in a manner that the human mind can process (e.g., by mimicking natural language and logical narrative flow).  Second, the use of functional/operational technical descriptions assists the person
of skill in the art in understanding the described subject matter by providing a description that is more or less independent of any specific vendor's piece(s) of hardware.
<BR><BR> The use of functional/operational technical descriptions assists the person of skill in the art in understanding the described subject matter since, as is evident from the above discussion, one could easily, although not quickly, transcribe the
technical descriptions set forth in this document as trillions of ones and zeroes, billions of single lines of assembly-level machine code, millions of logic gates, thousands of gate arrays, or any number of intermediate levels of abstractions.  However,
if any such low-level technical descriptions were to replace the present technical description, a person of skill in the art could encounter undue difficulty in implementing the disclosure, because such a low-level technical description would likely add
complexity without a corresponding benefit (e.g., by describing the subject matter utilizing the conventions of one or more vendor-specific pieces of hardware).  Thus, the use of functional/operational technical descriptions assists those of skill in the
art by separating the technical descriptions from the conventions of any vendor-specific piece of hardware.
<BR><BR> In view of the foregoing, the logical operations/functions set forth in the present technical description are representative of static or sequenced specifications of various ordered-matter elements, in order that such specifications may be
comprehensible to the human mind and adaptable to create many various hardware configurations.  The logical operations/functions disclosed herein should be treated as such, and should not be disparagingly characterized as abstract ideas merely because
the specifications they represent are presented in a manner that one of skill in the art can readily understand and apply in a manner independent of a specific vendor's hardware implementation.

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR> In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof.  In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise.  The illustrative
embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting.  Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.
<BR><BR> Those having skill in the art will recognize that the state of the art has progressed to the point where there is little distinction left between hardware, software, and/or firmware implementations of aspects of systems; the use of hardware,
software, and/or firmware is generally (but not always, in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant) a design choice representing cost vs.  efficiency tradeoffs.  Those having skill in the art will
appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and/or systems and/or other technologies described herein can be effected (e.g., hardware, software, and/or firmware), and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the
processes and/or systems and/or other technologies are deployed.  For example, if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and/or firmware vehicle; alternatively, if flexibility is
paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware, software, and/or firmware.  Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the processes
and/or devices and/or other technologies described herein may be effected, none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific
concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any of which may vary.  Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will typically employ optically-oriented hardware, software, and or
firmware.
<BR><BR> In some implementations described herein, logic and similar implementations may include software or other control structures suitable to operation.  Electronic circuitry, for example, may manifest one or more paths of electrical current
constructed and arranged to implement various logic functions as described herein.  In some implementations, one or more media are configured to bear a device-detectable implementation if such media hold or transmit a special-purpose device instruction
set operable to perform as described herein.  In some variants, for example, this may manifest as an update or other modification of existing software or firmware, or of gate arrays or other programmable hardware, such as by performing a reception of or
a transmission of one or more instructions in relation to one or more operations described herein.  Alternatively or additionally, in some variants, an implementation may include special-purpose hardware, software, firmware components, and/or
general-purpose components executing or otherwise invoking special-purpose components.  Specifications or other implementations may be transmitted by one or more instances of tangible transmission media as described herein, optionally by packet
transmission or otherwise by passing through distributed media at various times.
<BR><BR> Alternatively or additionally, implementations may include executing a special-purpose instruction sequence or otherwise invoking circuitry for enabling, triggering, coordinating, requesting, or otherwise causing one or more occurrences of any
functional operations described below.  In some variants, operational or other logical descriptions herein may be expressed directly as source code and compiled or otherwise invoked as an executable instruction sequence.  In some contexts, for example,
C++ or other code sequences can be compiled directly or otherwise implemented in high-level descriptor languages (e.g., a logic-synthesizable language, a hardware description language, a hardware design simulation, and/or other such similar mode(s) of
expression).  Alternatively or additionally, some or all of the logical expression may be manifested as a Verilog-type hardware description or other circuitry model before physical implementation in hardware, especially for basic operations or
timing-critical applications.  Those skilled in the art will recognize how to obtain, configure, and optimize suitable transmission or computational elements, material supplies, actuators, or other common structures in light of these teachings.
<BR><BR> In a general sense, those skilled in the art will recognize that the various embodiments described herein can be implemented, individually and/or collectively, by various types of electro-mechanical systems having a wide range of electrical
components such as hardware, software, firmware, and/or virtually any combination thereof; and a wide range of components that may impart mechanical force or motion such as rigid bodies, spring or torsional bodies, hydraulics, electro-magnetically
actuated devices, and/or virtually any combination thereof.  Consequently, as used herein "electro-mechanical system" includes, but is not limited to, electrical circuitry operably coupled with a transducer (e.g., an actuator, a motor, a piezoelectric
crystal, a Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS), etc.), electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one integrated circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one application specific
integrated circuit, electrical circuitry forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program (e.g., a general purpose computer configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and/or devices
described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and/or devices described herein), electrical circuitry forming a memory device (e.g., forms of memory (e.g., random access, flash, read
only, etc.)), electrical circuitry forming a communications device (e.g., a modem, communications switch, optical-electrical equipment, etc.), and/or any non-electrical analog thereto, such as optical or other analogs.  Those skilled in the art will also
appreciate that examples of electro-mechanical systems include but are not limited to a variety of consumer electronics systems, medical devices, as well as other systems such as motorized transport systems, factory automation systems, security systems,
and/or communication/computing systems.  Those skilled in the art will recognize that electro-mechanical as used herein is not necessarily limited to a system that has both electrical and mechanical actuation except as context may dictate otherwise.
<BR><BR> In a general sense, those skilled in the art will also recognize that the various aspects described herein which can be implemented, individually and/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, and/or any combination

153, 154; resource reservation modules 156, 157; or selective retention modules 158, 159 as described in further detail below.  In some contexts, primary unit 110 may be operably coupled to one or more networks 190 via one or more communication linkages
140.  Instances of storage or other data-handling media 195 operably coupled to one or more such modules may, moreover, reside in primary unit 110 or network 190, as described below.  As exemplified herein, a "module" may include special-purpose
hardware, general-purpose hardware configured with special-purpose software, or other circuitry configured to perform one or more functions recited below.  Also in some contexts such "modules" may be configured to establish or utilize an association
(between two devices, e.g.) in response to common interactions (a backup from one device to the other, both logging into a password-access account, or sharing the same printer or router or other peripheral, e.g.).  Moreover respective embodiments of
primary unit 110 may implement substantially any combination thereof, as exemplified in protocols described below.
<BR><BR> FIG. 2 depicts another context in which one or more technologies may be implemented.  System 2 comprises a kiosk 250 having several bays 288 each large enough to receive a respective unmanned aerial device (UAD) 201, 202 and accessible to one or

<BR><BR> FIG. 3 depicts another system 3 in which one or more technologies may be implemented, one in which one or more instances of a name 351, model 352, or other identifier 355 refer to and identify interface device 310.  In a context in which
interface device 310 comprises a minivan or other passenger vehicle, for example, such identifier(s) 355 may comprise a plate number 353 of the vehicle.  As explained below, interface device 310 may further include one or more instances (implemented in
special-purpose circuitry or software executable by one or more processors 365, e.g.) of modes 361, 362, 363; requests 373; invitations 374; reservations 376; confirmations 381, 382; touchscreens or other local interfaces 390 (comprising one or more
inputs 391 or outputs 392 physically accessible to or observable by a user at interface device 310, e.g.); acceptances 393, 394; memories 395; or instructions 397.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for conducting a context-specific structured dialog or other user interaction without undue
experimentation or for configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,024,329 ("Using inverted indexes for contextual personalized information retrieval"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,970,735 ("Cross varying dimension
support for analysis services engine"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,920,678 ("Personal virtual assistant"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,870,117 ("Constructing a search query to execute a contextual personalized search of a knowledge base"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,761,480

recognition"); U.S.  Pub.  No. 2008/0159622 ("Target object recognition in images and video").
<BR><BR> Referring again to FIG. 1, network 190 may serve as a context for introducing one or more processes, systems or other articles described below.  In some instances network 190 may include one or more search engines, satellites, servers,
processors, routers, or other devices.  In some contexts, one or more interface devices owned or operated by user 226 may interact through network 190 (e.g. with one or more other interface devices or networks as described herein).  One or more such
associated interface devices 310 may be mobile devices, in some contexts, or may function in cooperation (as a network subsystem, e.g.) even when remote from one another.  Alternatively or additionally, one or more other interface devices owned or
operated by user 226 may likewise interact locally or remotely with or through one another or other interface devices (through network 190, e.g.).
<BR><BR> In some contexts, such interface devices (of FIG. 2, e.g.) may include or otherwise communicate with one or more instances of primary unit 110 and may include one or more instances of data outputs or other implementations of machines, articles
of manufacture, or compositions of matter that include circuitry or other logic as described below.  In some contexts, such implementations may be held or transmitted by conduits, storage devices, memories, other holding devices, or other circuitry for
handling data or software (in a satellite, server, or router, e.g.) as described herein.  In various embodiments, one or more instances of implementation components or implementation output data may each be expressed within any aspect or combination of
software, firmware, or hardware as signals, data, designs, logic, instructions, or other such special-purpose expression or implementation.  Interface devices (such as that of FIG. 2, e.g.) may likewise include one or more instances of lenses,
transmitters, receivers, integrated circuits, antennas, output devices, reflectors, or input devices for handling data or communicating with local users or via linkage 140, for example.
<BR><BR> Those skilled in the art will recognize that some list items may also function as other list items.  In the above-listed types of media, for example, some instances of interface devices may include conduits or may also function as storage
devices that are also holding devices.  One or more transmitters may likewise include input devices or bidirectional user interfaces, in many implementations of interface devices 310.  Each such listed term should not be narrowed by any implication from
other terms in the same list but should instead be understood in its broadest reasonable interpretation as understood by those skilled in the art.
<BR><BR> "Apparent," "automatic," "selective," "conditional," "indicative," "normal," "represented," "related," "partly," "responsive," "distilled," "local," "in a vicinity," "remote," "wireless," "periodic," "free," "aerial," "associated," "primary,"
"met," "passive," "implemented," "executable," "particular," "specific," "human," "performed," "mobile," "of," "prior," "activated," "future," "light," "contemporaneous," "portable," "toward," or other such descriptors herein are used in their normal
yes-or-no sense, not as terms of degree, unless context dictates otherwise.  In light of the present disclosure those skilled in the art will understand from context what is meant by "vicinity," by being "in" or "at" a detection region, by "remote," and
by other such positional descriptors used herein.  "For" is not used to articulate a mere intended purpose in phrases like "circuitry for" or "instruction for," moreover, but is used normally, in descriptively identifying special purpose circuitry or
code.
<BR><BR> Some descriptions herein refer to a "distillation" of data.  Such distillations can include an average, estimate, range, or other computation at least partly distilling a set of data.  They can likewise include an indexing, sorting,
summarization, distributed sampling, or other process having a purpose or effect of showing some aspect of the data more concisely or effectively than a conventional display or archiving of the entire data.  Selecting a last portion of a data set can
constitute a distillation, for example, in a context in which the data's utility apparently increases (medians or other cumulative computations, e.g.).  Removing duplicative data or indexing available data are useful ways of "distilling" data so that it
becomes manageable even while retaining some of its meaning.  Those skilled in the art will recognize many useful modes of distilling data in light of the state of the art and of teachings herein.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, "signaling" something can include identifying, contacting, requesting, selecting, or indicating the thing.  In some cases a signaled thing is susceptible to fewer than all of these aspects, of course, such as a task
definition that cannot be "contacted."
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, "status indicative" data can reflect a trend or other time-dependent phenomenon (indicating some aspect of an entity's condition, e.g.).  Alternatively or additionally, a status indicative data set can include portions that
have no bearing upon such status.  Although some types of distillations can require authority or substantial expertise (e.g. making a final decision upon a risky procedure or other course of action), many other types of distillations can readily be
implemented without undue experimentation in light of teachings herein.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, one or more applicable "criteria" can include maxima or other comparison values applied to durations, counts, lengths, widths, frequencies, signal magnitudes or phases, digital values, or other aspects of data
characterization.  In some contexts, such criteria can be applied by determining when or how often a recognizable pattern can be found: a text string, a quantity, a sound, an arrhythmia, a visible dilation, a failure to respond, a non-change, an allergic
response, a symptom relating to an apparent condition of the user, or the like.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, "causing" events can include triggering, producing or otherwise directly or indirectly bringing the events to pass.  This can include causing the events remotely, concurrently, partially, or otherwise as a "cause in fact,"
whether or not a more immediate cause also exists.
<BR><BR> Some descriptions herein refer to an "indication whether" an event has occurred.  An indication is "positive" if it indicates that the event has occurred, irrespective of its numerical sign or lack thereof.  Whether positive or negative, such
indications may be weak (i.e. slightly probative), definitive, or many levels in between.  In some cases the "indication" may include a portion that is indeterminate, such as an irrelevant portion of a useful photograph.
<BR><BR> FIG. 4 depicts another system 4 in which one or more technologies may be implemented.  Event/condition detection unit 400 comprises special-purpose circuitry implemented as one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) 409 or
other such data-handling media 410.  Event/condition detection unit 400 may, in some variants, include one or more instances of data 411, 412, 413; hard-wired or other special-purpose protocols 417, 418; triggers 421, 422, 423; decisions 434, 435;
microphones 441 or other receivers 442; identifiers 444; proximity sensors 449; wireless signal processing modules 450 (operable to handle one or more signals 451, 452, 453, 434 transmitted or received via antenna 455, e.g.); thresholds 458, 459;
configurations 471, 472; commands 481, 482, 483, 484, 485; or tasks 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499 (implemented in special-purpose circuitry or software executable by one or more processors 365, e.g.).  In some variants, such commands
481-485 or tasks 491-499 may be received (from user 226, e.g.) via a microphone 441 and a speech recognition module 446, 447 or other such configurations of inputs 391.  (In some embodiments, a "module" as described herein may include one or more of
special-purpose circuitry or special-purpose device-executable code: code by which a processor 365 that is executing the code, for example, becomes a special-purpose machine.)
<BR><BR> FIG. 5 depicts another system 5 in which one or more technologies may be implemented.  An unmanned aerial device (UAD) 501 may travel among a sender 510 (of cargo to be delivered, e.g.), a station 520, and a destination 530 (of the cargo, e.g.)
along travel paths 581, 582, 583 through the air 585 as shown.  One or more media 195, 410 aboard UAD 501 may contain one or more identifiers 541 of cargo, identifiers 542 of destination 530, or identifiers 543 of the UAD 501 tasked with delivery.  Such
media may likewise contain other indicia of various planned or completed delivery tasks 491-499, such as a photograph 553 of an item of cargo (envelope 551, e.g.) having been delivered to a delivery site 552 (at destination 530, e.g.); a photograph 554
of a part of a recipient 555 or of an item of cargo (syringe 556, e.g.) being delivered to a destination (recipient 555, e.g.); addresses (of sender 510, station 520, or destination 530, e.g.); audio clips 563 (of recipient 555 refusing or accepting
delivery, e.g.); or biometrics 564 (of sender 510 or recipient 555, e.g.).  In some implementations, moreover, UAD 501 may implement or interact with one or more instances of interfaces 390 (having one or more buttons 561 thereon as inputs 391, e.g.) as
described below.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 15, shown is a high-level logic flow 15 of an operational process.  Intensive operation 53 describes obtaining first data indicating that a first unmanned aerial device delivered a first item to a first entity (e.g.
data acquisition module 138 receiving one or more addresses 562 or photographs 553 as data 411 indicating that one or more UAD's 501 delivered an envelope 551, signature document, or other article to a placement site 552 or other destination 530).  This
can occur, for example, in a context in which UAD 501 implements or interacts with primary unit 110, UAD 201, and event/condition detection unit 400 as described above.  Alternatively or additionally, data 412 may include a biometric 564 (fingerprint,
e.g.) or other manifestation of a recipient 555 receiving a medication (in a syringe 556 or capsule, e.g.) or other delivered material as described herein.  Either such "first" data 411, 412 may likewise include one or more of an identifier 541 of the
"first" item (envelope 551 or syringe 556, e.g.), an identifier 542 of the "first" entity (site 552 or recipient 555, e.g.), an identifier 543 (serial number or alias, e.g.) of the "first" UAD 201, 501 or other such indications signifying a successful
delivery.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for dispatching a vehicle for making deliveries without undue experimentation or for configuring
other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,140,592 ("Delivery operations information system with route adjustment feature and methods of use"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,041,649 ("Methods and systems for postcode-to-postcode
delivery interval and routing calculation"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,947,916 ("Mail sorter system and method for moving trays of mail to dispatch in delivery order"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,868,264 ("System and process for reducing number of stops on delivery route

6,801,139 ("Method and system for delivering a time-efficient mobile vehicle route that encompasses multiple limited-duration events").
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for data acquisition (relating to a delivery, e.g.) without undue experimentation or for
configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,111,819 ("Message server and method for notification of a user about the delivery of an electronic message"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,074,642 ("Visual indicator for an
aerosol medication delivery apparatus and system"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,984,100 ("Email system automatically notifying sender status and routing information during delivery"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,713,229 ("Drug delivery pen with event notification means");

No. 6,859,722 ("Notification systems and methods with notifications based upon prior package delivery"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,535,585 ("System and method for notification upon successful message delivery"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,356,196 ("Verified receipt,
notification, and theft deterrence of courier-delivered parcels").
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for detecting and responding automatically to position data, optical data, auditory data, or other
indications of a delivery without undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,131,652 ("Residential delivery indicator"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,559,456 ("Mail delivery indicator
system"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,483,721 ("Communication device providing diverse audio signals to indicate receipt of a call or message"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,346,662 ("Methods, systems, and products for indicating receipt of electronic mail"); U.S.  Pat.  No.

communication directed to a uniquely identified vehicle").
<BR><BR> In some embodiments described herein, a response (generating a decision, e.g.) to a stimulus is "conditional" if the stimulus can take on either a first possible value or a second possible value (or perhaps others) and in which the content (yes
or no, e.g.) or occurrence of the response depends upon which of the possible stimuli are manifested.  Likewise a response is "automatic" if it can occur (for at least one possible stimulus set, e.g.) without any human interaction.
<BR><BR> Referring again to FIG. 15, extensive operation 84 describes transmitting via a free space medium the first data to a provider of the first item as an automatic and conditional response to the first data indicating that the first unmanned aerial
device delivered the first item to the first entity, the first data indicating at least one of the first item or the first entity or the first unmanned aerial device (e.g. data delivery module 153 transmitting a wireless signal 454 (radio frequency,
e.g.) containing data 411, 412 indicating a delivery of the first item to the sender 510 of the first item).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which data delivery module 153 receives such first data from data acquisition module 138; in which
the first item comprises an envelope 551, syringe 556, material, or other such articles physically delivered by one or more UAD's 201, 501 to destination 530; in which such a UAD includes a data delivery module 153 configured to transmit such first data
via a wireless signal path 581 (through air 585 or water vapor, e.g.); and in which sender 510 would otherwise be unwilling to entrust the item to be transferred via UAD 501.  Alternatively or additionally, such a data delivery module 153 may be
configured to transmit such first data indirectly (via a wireless signal path 583 through air 585 and through a station 520 that relays signal 454 to sender 510, e.g.).  Alternatively or additionally, station 520 may include (an instance of) a data
delivery module 153 configured to perform operation 84 by transmitting some or all such data 411, 412 wirelessly via path 582 as an automatic and conditional response to a suitable trigger 421.  In respective embodiments, for example, a primary unit 110
may be configured to perform flow 15 such that trigger 421 comprises any of (1) UAD 501 delivering the first item to destination 530; (2) UAD 501 arriving at station 520 after having delivered the first item to destination 530; or (3) data delivery
module 153 receiving an indication that UAD 201 delivered the first item to destination 530.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for deciding whether or not to route data through a free space medium without undue experimentation
or for configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,175,025 ("Wireless communication apparatus for selecting suitable transfer route on wireless network"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,099,060 ("Wireless/wired mobile

("Automatic selecting apparatus for an optimum wireless communication route").
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for mobile data delivery (deciding when to transmit data from or via a mobile device, e.g.) without
undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,200,223 ("Base station and data transfer method for transferring data when a mobile station performs a handover"); U.S.  Pat.  No.

<BR><BR> FIG. 6 depicts another system 6 in which one or more technologies may be implemented, one involving a passenger vehicle (car 602, e.g.) with wheels 683, pontoons, or other such support structures configured to facilitate transportation.  As
shown, car 602 is configured to bear at least one person (user 626, e.g.) and to include a user interface 660 (navigation system, e.g.).  In a context in which such a passenger vehicle approaches an entrance 641 of a parking lot, UAD 601 may be
configured (in association with the vehicle or with a zone comprising the parking lot, e.g.) to transmit to the vehicle information of interest.  Such information can include coordinates 605, 606 (indicating an open parking space 648 or other location of
interest, e.g.) or other positional information (indicating a recommended path 643 or waypoint 642 thereof, e.g.) transmitted via a wireless communication linkage 694.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 16, shown is a high-level logic flow 16 of an operational process.  Intensive operation 51 describes obtaining first position data from a first entity, by a second entity, the first entity being a first unmanned aerial
device (e.g. a coordinate communication module 136 resident in car 602 receiving two or more coordinates 605 from UAD 601 indicating the position of UAD 601).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which UAD 601 implements one or more UAD's 201,
501 as described above; in which an instance of primary unit 110 is resident in one or both of the "first" and "second" entities; in which the "second" entity (car 602 or user 626, e.g.) has arrived at an entrance 641 of a crowded parking lot; in which
UAD 601 has found and occupied a vacant parking space 648; and in which UAD 601 transmits its location (to a user interface 660 of the "second" entity, e.g.) via a wireless linkage 694 to assist a device or user (in finding and occupying the parking
space 648, e.g.).  In some contexts, the first UAD 601 may include an interface control module 141 configured to transmit turn-by-turn instructions, coordinates 605, or other such guidance, for example.  See FIG. 17.  Such guidance can, for example, lead

<BR><BR> Referring again to FIG. 16, extensive operation 83 describes signaling a decision whether or not to allocate a first resource to the second entity after the first position data passes from the first unmanned aerial device to the second entity,
the first resource being associated with the first position data (e.g. resource reservation module 156 confirming a reservation 376 of parking space 648 after coordinates 605 thereof arrive at user interface 660).  This can occur, for example, in a
context in which parking space 648 is the "first" resource; in which the "second" entity is identified as the driver (by name 351, e.g.) or as the car (by model 352 or license plate number 353, e.g.); in which UAD 601 and user interface 660 each contain
an instance of primary unit 110; in which UAD 601 receives and announces one or more such identifiers (via a speaker, projector, or other output 122 of UAD 601, e.g.) to passersby; in which user 626 enters the decision by indicating whether or not to
associate the "first" resource with an identifier 355 of the second entity via input 121 of user interface 660; and in which user 626 would otherwise be unable to reserve the resource before happening across it.  In other applications of flow 16, such
"first" resources may include a cashier or other living entity; a public table or other space; a <B><I>power</I></B> or network connection; an item for sale or other object; or other such resources that a device can deem available for allocation under conditions as
described herein.  Moreover such "second" entities may include UAD's or other devices or people as described herein (identified by entity identification module 143, e.g.).
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for entity identification (associating a specific identifier with a device, user, group, or other

<BR><BR> FIG. 7 depicts another system 7 in which one or more technologies may be implemented, depicting a view from above of several people 725, 726, 727 near a zone boundary 789 dividing two zones 781, 782 (areas of land, e.g.).  Person 726 is shown
carrying an unmanned aerial device 701 containing itineraries 761, 762 (in a memory 395 or other medium 195 thereof, e.g.) in one or more contexts further described below.  In one context, person 726 is walking, and UAD 701 is traveling, toward a person
725 or device 775 that is currently a distance 788 away.  In another, the destination 530 is defined as a vicinity 785 (a detection range of a proximity sensor 449, e.g.) of such a device 775.  In another context, UAD 701 is guiding person 726 generally
along a static or dynamic path 743 comprising a waypoint 742.  In yet another context, a subject (person 727, e.g.) has one or more attributes (clothing 728 or voice or face or other biometric 564, e.g.) susceptible of automatic recognition by one or
more stationary event/condition detection units 400 or other recognition modules (aboard a UAD 701 or other portable device 775, e.g.).  See FIG. 14.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 17, shown is a high-level logic flow 17 of an operational process.  Intensive operation 52 describes causing a first unmanned aerial device to guide a first individual to a first destination (e.g. interface control
module 141 causing a display, speaker, or other output 392 of unmanned aerial device 701 to provide navigational instruction 397 effective for guiding person 726 according to a first itinerary 761).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which the
first destination is a vicinity 785 of a person 725 or of a portable device 775; in which the first destination is also a non-stationary component of the first itinerary 761 (indicating such a person 725, device 775, or other destination, e.g.); in which
person 726 is the "first" individual, who may be traveling through a zone 782 in which conventional GPS navigation devices cannot be used; and in which person 726 would otherwise have to find the "first" destination without any device assistance.  On a
cruise ship or tightly managed facility in which an owner (of zone 782, e.g.) does not provide a public wireless connectivity (cell tower access, e.g.) or in which individuals are not permitted to bring their own wireless devices onsite, for example, the
owner may lend such UAD's 701 to visitors for authorized uses (finding a stationary or other destination 530 within or across a controlled zone 782, e.g.).  Alternatively, in some variants, a flight control module 151 may perform operation 52 by flying
ahead of the first individual (user 626, e.g.) slow enough to be followed.  This can occur, for example, in a context in which itinerary 761 defines the first destination (parking space 648, e.g.) and in which flight control module 151 is configured to
respond to a microphone, accelerometer, camera, or other input 391 of a "first" UAD signaling such flying guidance.  For example, flight control module 151 may be configured to cause the first UAD to maintain a suitable lead distance (on the order of 1-3
meters, e.g.) of the first individual in some contexts, landing or otherwise slowing down as necessary if the individual follows slowly, moving laterally or backward if the individual moves orthogonally to or opposite to the first UAD's current or next
direction of travel, giving up (and returning to a kiosk 250 or other "home" station, e.g.) if the individual stops following for a period of time exceeding a threshold (on the order of 1 or 60 seconds, e.g.).
<BR><BR> Alternatively or additionally, an instance of flight control module 151 aboard UAD 701 may be configured (by including a microphone 441 operatively coupled to a speech recognition module 446, e.g.) to recognize and conditionally follow one or
more commands given by the first person ("stay with me" or "fly away" e.g.).  In some variants, for example, such a command 482 of "stay with me" can conditionally cause an override or modification of a default configuration of flight control module 151
so that flight control module 152 is temporarily disabled or so that itinerary 762 is suspended until after speech recognition module 446 detects and signals the "fly away" command 483 (to one or more flight control modules 151, 152, e.g.).  This can
occur, for example, in a context in which the latter event defines an alternative trigger 422 causing the first UAD to fly to a "home" station (or a "second" destination, e.g.) defined by itinerary 762 under the control of flight control module 152.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for interface control (remotely or locally controlling how an interface handles user input or
output, e.g.) without undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,201,143 ("Dynamic mating of a modified user interface with pre-modified user interface code library"); U.S. 
Pat.  No. 8,198,568 ("Input sensitive user interface"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,185,483 ("System for design and use of decision models"); U.S.  Pat.

meta-data"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,165,567 ("Method and system for customizing user interface by editing multimedia content"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,151,201 ("User interface manager and method for reacting to a change in system status"); U.S.  Pat.  No.

providing methods for dynamic customization and personalization of user interface").
<BR><BR> Referring again to FIG. 17, extensive operation 85 describes causing the first unmanned aerial device to fly to a second destination as an automatic and conditional response to an indication of the first individual arriving at the first
destination (e.g. flight control module 152 causing a "first" UAD 701 to fly to a kiosk 250 or other station 520 as an implementation of an itinerary 762 triggered by the first UAD arriving at the first destination).  This can occur, for example, in a
context in which the first UAD implements one or more primary units 110 or interface devices 310; in which the "second" destination comprises the kiosk 250 or other station 520; in which a proximity sensor 449 or other such input 121 (operatively coupled
to a flight control module 152 of device 775, e.g.) detects that UAD 701 is in a vicinity 785 of device 775 (as the indication of the first individual arriving at the first destination, e.g.); and in which person 726 would otherwise have to instruct UAD
701 what to do after arriving.  In some variants, for example, such an input 121 may include a wireless signal processing module 450 configured to transmit a first wireless signal 451 and receive a second wireless signal 452 (echo, e.g.) responsive
thereto, the wireless signals 451, 452 jointly manifesting a delay indicative of a distance 788 between the devices so that a signal 453 derived therefrom indicates the first UAD arriving "at" the first destination as the derived signal 453 crossing a
threshold 458, the flight control module 152 being operatively coupled to wireless signal processing module 450 and responsive to such crossing.  Alternatively or additionally, network 190 may include an event/condition detection unit 400 implemented in
UAD 701.  In some variants, moreover, one or more additional flight control modules 152 may be configured to perform one or more variants of operation 85 (causing the 1st UAD to fly to a 3nd destination as an automatic and conditional response to an
indication of the first individual arriving at the 2nd destination or to some other indication of the first UAD arriving at the 2nd destination, e.g.).
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for flight control (using one or more remote or on-board controllers to cause an aerial device to
implement a user-specified or autonomously selected route or itinerary, e.g.) without undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,186,589 ("UAV decision and control system");
U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,100,366 ("Automatic kite flight control system"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,074,941 ("Aircraft flight control"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,962,252 ("Self-contained avionics sensing and flight control system for small unmanned aerial vehicle"); U.S.

("Automatic pilot system for model aircraft").
<BR><BR> Another system 8 in which one or more technologies may be implemented is shown in FIG. 8, depicting a view of several unmanned aerial devices (UAD's) 801, 802, 803 configured to communicate with a control unit 860 on a network 890.  Task
definition module 870 (residing in control unit 860, e.g.) may include one or more aliases 871 in a role list 875 (identifying one or more unmet needs of a task 491-499, e.g.) and one or more aliases ("Hulk," e.g.) in a participant list 885 or other met
needs list 880 of the task or job.  UAD 801 comprises a name recognition module 810 configured to recognized a primary identifier 811 of UAD 801.  UAD 802 comprises a name recognition module 820 configured to recognized a primary identifier 821 of UAD
802 as well as one or more aliases 822, 823 of UAD 802.  (In some embodiments, one or more aliases or other identifiers "of" a device may also refer to a specific circuit or virtual entity at least partly aboard the device.)
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 18, shown is a high-level logic flow 18 of an operational process.  Intensive operation 54 describes indicating a first unmanned aerial device participating in a first task (e.g. enlistment module 133 generating a
confirmation 381 that UAD 801 will participate in a delivery task 491 being coordinated by control unit 860).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which one or more networks 190, 890 comprise interface device 310; in which control unit 860 and
UAD's 801, 802, 803 may each contain (a respective instance of) primary unit 110, each optionally including event/condition detection unit 400; in which (an instance of) enlistment module 133 resides in control unit 840 and transmits an invitation 374 to
UAD 801 to participate in one or more tasks 491-499; and in which UAD 801 transmits a timely acceptance 393 of the invitation 374.  Alternatively or additionally, one or more enlistment modules 134 (resident in UAD 801, e.g.) may be configured to
identify tasks 491, 492 suitable for UAD 801 to participate in and may transmit one or more requests 373 for such participation (to control unit 860, e.g.).  This can occur, for example, in which enlistment module 133 is configured to perform an instance
of operation 54 by transmitting an acceptance 394 of request 373.  In some contexts, such requests 373 and invitations 374 (in an instance of network 190 that includes several UAD's 801, 802, 803 as described above, e.g.) may include a temporal threshold
459 expressing a deadline at or before which the request or invitation recipient must respond (as an expiration time of the request or invitation after which no acceptance of such request 373 or invitation 374 would be valid, e.g.).  Alternatively or
additionally, in the absence of such expression, one or more enlistment modules 133, 134 may be configured to apply a default deadline (within 1-2 orders of magnitude of a millisecond or a second after such transmission, e.g.), after which such
recruitment subtask may be deemed unsuccessful.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for device enlistment (enabling or otherwise causing one or more available devices to participate
in one or more suitable tasks, e.g.) without undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,151,272 ("Optimized usage of collector resources for performance data collection through
even task assignment"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,128,484 ("Game system generating second game according to game result of a device and allowing other devices to participate in second game thus generated"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,051,764 ("Fluid control system having

ticket scoring"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,493,581 ("System and method for rapid recruitment of widely distributed easily operated automatic external defibrillators").
<BR><BR> Referring again to FIG. 18, extensive operation 82 describes signaling a decision whether or not to cause the first unmanned aerial device to recognize an alias identifying the first unmanned aerial device as an automatic and conditional
response to an indication of the first unmanned aerial device participating in the first task, the alias being different than a primary digital identifier of the first unmanned aerial device (e.g. control unit 860 transmitting a command 481 that
configures name recognition module 810 to respond to an alias 871 of "Aunt" as an automatic and conditional response to control unit 860 receiving an acceptance or confirmation 381 indicating that UAD 801 will participate in delivery task 491).  This can
occur, for example, in a context in which "Aunt" is not a primary identifier 811 (serial number or Internet Protocol address, e.g.) that UAD 801 ordinarily responds to and in which name recognition module 810 was previously configured not to respond to
"Aunt"; in which a name recognition module 820 of UAD 802 responds to an alias 822 of "Hulk" pursuant to the same delivery task 491; in which a primary identifier 821 of UAD 802 is neither "Hulk" nor "Aunt"; in which enlistment module 133 also causes
alias 871 to be transferred into a participant list 885 of the delivery task 491 (in a met needs list 880 thereof, e.g.) that grows with each successful recruitment; and in which the primary digital identifier would otherwise have to be used throughout
the task in addressing UAD 801.  Alternatively or additionally, a primary unit 110 (residing in station 520, e.g.) remotely controlling UAD 801 may include a name recognition module 146 configured to perform operation 84 (pursuant to a successful
recruitment as described above, e.g.).
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for name recognition (determining whether an incoming signal is addressing an entity by comparing a
component of the incoming signal against one or more names of the entity, e.g.) without undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,135,764 ("Configuration management server,
name recognition method and name recognition program"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,865,356 ("Method and apparatus for providing proper or partial proper name recognition"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,822,988 ("Method and system for identity recognition"); U.S.  Pat.  No.

<BR><BR> Another system 9 in which one or more technologies may be implemented is shown in FIG. 9, depicting UAD 901 (comprising primary unit 110, e.g.) operably connected with one or more networks 190 (comprising network 990, e.g.) via a wireless
communication linkage 994.  Network 990 includes (a memory 395 or other data handling medium 195 containing) one or more records 961, 962, 963, 964, some of which may (optionally) include digitally represented delivery tasks 980 or other tasks 491-499,
each of which may (optionally) comprise one or more instances of task descriptions 981 or tracking modes 982 as shown.  UAD 901 may (optionally) include one or more instances of tracking control modules 977; record generation modules 978, or record
omission modules 979.  In some contexts, UAD 901 (implementing UAD 501, e.g.) may be configured to fly (along respective paths 581, 582, 583, e.g.) among two or more stations 930, 940, 950 (e.g. on respective buildings 935, 945, 955), some or all of
which may be observable by a stationary or pivotable camera 936 (in a configuration like systems 3-8 described above, e.g.).
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 19, shown is a high-level logic flow 19 of an operational process.  Intensive operation 55 describes obtaining a tracking mode of a delivery task of a first unmanned aerial device (e.g. tracking control module 977
receiving a tracking mode 982 of zero pertaining to a delivery task 980 that has been assigned to UAD 901).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which a task description 981 of delivery task 980 indicates a physical delivery of a "first" item
(envelope 551, e.g.) to station 940; in which UAD 901 implements a primary unit 110 that includes data acquisition module 138; in which one or more just-completed task 493 involved UAD 901 visiting station 950; in which a tracking mode 982 of zero
corresponds to a delivery protocol 417 by which the specific item is delivered in lieu of operation 53 (without notifying a provider of an item delivered, e.g.); and in which tracking control module 977 would otherwise trigger data acquisition module 138
to obtain at least some delivery-indicative data 411-413 in response to the item being delivered to station 940 (by performing operation 53, e.g.).  See FIG. 15.  In some variants, for example, task 493 may include one or more instances of delivery tasks
494, pickup tasks 495, recharge tasks 496, reconfiguration tasks 497, or data transfer tasks 498.  In some variants, for example, UAD 901 downloads each successive task in a resting state after completing the prior task.  Alternatively or additionally,
tracking control module 977 may be configured to implement a default tracking mode 361--indicating at least one of the first item(s) or UAD(s), e.g.--for each task 494-499 except when that task specifies an alternative tracking mode (such as a brief mode
362 or user-defined mode 363, e.g.).
<BR><BR> In some variants, one or more instances of tracking control module 148 resident in network 990 may be configured to perform operation 55.  This can occur, for example, in a context in which the first UAD 901 does not have any on-board capability
of performing operation 55 or is currently configured not to perform operation 55; in which network 990 contains one or more instances of primary unit 110 (resident in a "second" UAD 202 or tower-based station 520, e.g.); and in which tracking control
module 148 receives tracking mode 982 as a component of a delivery task 980 assigned to the first UAD 901.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for tracking control (identifying and updating how increments of task progress are documented,
e.g.) without undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,179,261 ("Identification and surveillance device, system and method for individual item level tracking"); U.S.  Pat. 
No. 8,179,253 ("Location and tracking system, method and device using wireless technology"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,135,171 ("Multipoint tracking method and related device"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,115,625 ("Parental alert and child tracking device which
determines if a child has deviated from a predicated travel route"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,014,917 ("Apparatus for tracking and recording vital signs and task-related information of a vehicle to identify operating patterns"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,978,065
("Device, system and method for tracking mobile assets"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,951,046 ("Device, method and computer program product for tracking and monitoring an exercise regimen"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,451,445 ("Mechanism for tracking the execution progress
of a parent task which spawns one or more concurrently executing child tasks"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,401,030 ("Method and system for tracking disposition status of an item to be delivered within an organization"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,604,124 ("Systems and
methods for automatically managing work flow based on tracking job step completion status"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,463,420 ("Online tracking of delivery status information over a computer network").
<BR><BR> Referring again to FIG. 19, extensive operation 81 describes signaling a decision whether or not to omit a record of the first unmanned aerial device completing the delivery task of the first unmanned aerial device as an automatic and
conditional response to the tracking mode of the delivery task of the first unmanned aerial device (e.g. selective retention module 158 implementing either a decision 434 to deactivate record generation module 978 temporarily or a decision 435 to cause
record generation module 978 to generate a record 961 of "first" UAD 901 having made such a delivery by configuring record generation module 978 before UAD 901 approaches building 945).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which decision 435 is
"implemented" by a selective retention module 158 (resident in network 990, e.g.) transmitting (to record generation module 978, e.g.) either (1) a Boolean expression ("yes," e.g.) indicating that a user has requested one or more records 961-963 of the
delivery or (2) an identifier 444 of which tracking mode 361-363 to use in such acquisition.  Alternatively or additionally, decision 435 may be implemented by causing record generation module 978 to be transmitted to or updated aboard UAD 901.  Likewise
a decision 434 "to omit a record" may be "implemented" by selective retention module 158 causing a selective deletion of record 961 (of UAD 901 delivering the "first" item to station 940, e.g.) before one or more similar records 962-964 (relating to
other tasks, e.g.) are transmitted from UAD 901 to network 990 (in a batch transfer, e.g.).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which a data acquisition module 139 residing in UAD 901 generates and holds at least one photograph 553, 554 or
other record 961-963 for each delivery aboard UAD 901 (in a memory 395 or other data-handling medium 195 thereof, e.g.); in which record omission module 979 selectively deletes a subset of such records 961-963 identified by selective retention module
158; and in which a remainder (comprising record 962, e.g.) of such records is later transmitted to network 990.  In other contexts a selective retention module 158 resident in network 990 can implement a decision to omit such a record 961 of the
delivery task completion (from a data transmission to a station 520 outside network 990, e.g.) by explicitly listing (a) one or more records 962-963 to be included in such transmission or (b) one or more records 961 to be excluded from such transmission. This can occur, for example, in a context in which UAD 901 implements primary unit 110 and one or more of the above-described UAD's and in which either (1) unwanted tracking of delivery task 980 would occur or (2) UAD 901 would be unable to track a
completion of other potentially available tasks 491-499.

module 1130 residing in UAD 1005 or another module depicted in FIGS. 1-20, e.g.) is configured to respond.  Each such trigger may likewise comprise one or more software-implemented control modules 2124 (comprising a device-implemented command sequence
2125, e.g.) or operating parameters 2126, 2127, 2128.
<BR><BR> Several variants described herein refer to software or other device-detectable "implementations" such as one or more instances of computer-readable code, transistor or latch connectivity layouts or other geometric expressions of logical
elements, firmware or software expressions of transfer functions implementing computational specifications, digital expressions of truth tables, or the like.  Such instances can, in some implementations, include source code or other human-readable
portions.  Alternatively or additionally, functions of implementations described herein may constitute one or more device-detectable outputs such as decisions, manifestations, side effects, results, coding or other expressions, displayable images, data
files, data associations, statistical correlations, streaming signals, intensity levels, frequencies or other measurable attributes, packets or other encoded expressions, or the like from invoking or monitoring the implementation as described herein.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, a "state" of a component may comprise "available" or some other such state-descriptive labels, an event count or other such memory values, a partial depletion or other such physical property of a supply device, a voltage, or
any other such conditions or attributes that may change between two or more possible values irrespective of device location.  Such states may be received directly as a measurement or other detection, in some variants, and/or may be inferred from a
component's behavior over time.  A distributed or other composite system may comprise vector-valued device states, moreover, which may affect dispensations or departures in various ways as exemplified herein.
<BR><BR> Another context in which one or more technologies may be implemented is shown in FIG. 22.  A medium 2200 (configured to implement storage or transmission or display, e.g.) may bear one or more instances of job records 2210; data 2250, 2251,

<BR><BR> Another context in which one or more technologies may be implemented is shown in FIG. 28.  A mounted camera 2836 (supported by a building or other stationary structure, e.g.) is configured to observe one or more instances of a particular person
(a recipient 2850 of a delivery, e.g.) or a portion thereof (a hand 2864 or face 2865, e.g.) or a wearable device (an earpiece 2861 or wristband 2863, e.g.) or a partial or entire vicinity 2855 (room or other facility, e.g.) of one of these entities. 
Moreover in some contexts, as further described below, recipient 2850 may be a user of one or more of the above-described devices (in vicinity 2855, e.g.).
<BR><BR> With reference now to flow 23 of FIG. 23 and to other flows 15-19 described above, in some variants, one or more intensive operations 2311, 2316, 2318 described below may (optionally) be performed in conjunction with one or more intensive
operations 51-55 described above.  Alternatively or additionally, extensive operation 2393 described below may likewise comprise or be performed in conjunction with one or more extensive operations 81-85 described above.
<BR><BR> Intensive operation 2311 describes configuring the first unmanned aerial device to perform a first observation of a particular task in a first zone and a second unmanned aerial device to perform a second observation of the particular task in a
second zone (e.g. task implementation module 1138 transmitting a trigger 2282 causing UAD 801 to capture an audio or video clip 2151 of a person 726 carrying UAD 701 seeking device 775 in zone 781 and also transmitting a trigger 2283 instructing UAD 802
to capture an audio or video clip 2152 of the person 726 seeking device 775 in zone 782).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which one or more UAD's 701 or people 726 are performing the particular task 499 (monitoring person 726 seeking device
775, e.g.) across one or more zone boundaries 789; in which secondary unit 1150 includes event/condition detection unit 400 and media 2100, 2200; in which at least one UAD 801, 802 contains or otherwise interacts with secondary unit 1150; in which such
UAD's 801, 802 or people 726 have different UAD operating restrictions in respective zones 781, 782 (UAD 801 lacking permission to move or transmit only within zone 782, for example, or UAD 802 lacking permission to move or transmit only within zone
781); and in which adequate surveillance of the entire task 499 would otherwise be prohibited (by the owners of the respective zones 781, 782, e.g.).
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for coordinating surveillance among two or more observers without undue experimentation or for
configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,180,107 ("Active coordinated tracking for multi-camera systems"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,947,936 ("Apparatus and method for cooperative multi target tracking and

<BR><BR> Intensive operation 2316 describes configuring the first unmanned aerial device to capture normalcy-indicative data relating to a human subject (e.g. task implementation module 1135 causing, by transmitting an appropriate trigger 2281, a data
capture module 1108 to record one or more scalar measurements 2211-2213 or other data 2250-2253 directly or indirectly indicative of whether or not an item recipient 555, user 226, 626 or other human subject meets one or more recognizable criteria
indicative of the human subject being impaired or otherwise abnormal).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which a primary unit 110 contains a data capture module 1108 of one secondary unit 1150 and receives the trigger 2281 from another
secondary unit 1150; in which data 2251 comprises a video clip of the human subject taking something (a purse, e.g.) previously carried by another and then running away (at a pace greater than 4 miles per hour within 5 seconds of the taking event, e.g.);
and in which primary unit 110 also implements one or more media 2200 of a "first" UAD as described above.  See, e.g., FIG. 2 or 5-10.  In some contexts, such optically detectable events 1414 or conditions may be recognizable (as negatively indicative of
normalcy, e.g.) by a corresponding optical condition detection module 1404 or by security personnel remotely viewing such data 2250.  Alternatively or additionally, data 2252 may comprise (1) an infrared image indicating warmer-than-normal or
cooler-than-normal regions of the human subject's skin; (2) one or more scalar measurements 2211, 2212 of the subject's body temperature, exhaled gas analysis (detecting a ketone concentration or other indication of intoxication, e.g.), rates (of
respiration, speech, movement, or heartbeats, e.g.), or other such biometric parameters.  Such events 1415 or conditions may be device-detectable or humanly recognizable (as negatively indicative of normalcy, e.g.) by a corresponding optical condition
detection module 1404, by another pattern recognition module 1421, or by a person remotely viewing such data 2251-2253 in real time.  In some contexts, for example, pattern recognition module 1421 may comprise a comparator 1401 configured to generate one
or more results 2221, 2222 ("normal," e.g.) of comparing one or more performance or biometric measurements 2211-2213 of a user 226, 626 each against one or more corresponding normalcy-indicative thresholds 2291-2293 (maxima, e.g.).  Such recognition may,
for example, trigger the "first" UAD to obtain additional images or measurements 2214 pertaining to the apparent normalcy of the human subject.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for obtaining measurements, comparison results, or other normalcy-indicative data without undue

<BR><BR> Intensive operation 2318 describes causing the first unmanned aerial device to undertake a performance observation task of a job that includes a performance task and the performance observation task (e.g. task implementation module 1137
transmitting to UAD 501, as the "first" UAD, a task identifier 2201 corresponding to a task description 1251 calling for specific status-indicative data 1240 relating to another device 1010 undertaking to fulfill a performance task description 1252
corresponding to task identifier 2202).  This can occur, for example, in which secondary unit 1150 and media 1200, 2200 reside aboard UAD 501; in which the "performance" specified by task description 1252 comprises delivering an envelope 551; in which
task description 1251 relates to obtaining one or more of image data 1241 (including photograph 553, e.g.), GPS data 1242 (of destination 530, e.g.), or timing data 1243 documenting the delivery; and in which such observation and performance are
respectively identified by task identifiers 2201, 2202 of a single common job record 2210.  Alternatively or additionally, such task description 1251 and other task descriptions 1252, 1253 may comprise job description data 1130 managed and delegated by a
common task implementation module 1137.  Other such task identifiers or descriptions may (optionally) comprise a scalar or other operating parameter 2126 of one or more triggers 421-423, 2111-2120 transmitted by task implementation modules 1130-1139, for

<BR><BR> Extensive operation 2393 describes configuring the first unmanned aerial device to transmit a wireless signal indicative of having performed a particular task and not to store any indication of having performed the particular task (e.g. task
implementation module 1136 transmitting a trigger 2114 to which a component of UAD 1005 responds by transmitting one or more optical or other wireless signals 454 indicative of UAD 1005 having completed a particular task 491-499 without any component
borne by UAD 1005 storing any indication of the particular task having been performed).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which volatile memory 395 contains an indication 2108 of such completion that task implementation module 1136 includes
in wireless signal 454 and in which task implementation module 1136 comprises event/condition detection unit 400.  Alternatively or additionally, task implementation module 1136 may be configured to generate an indication 2108 of such completion (in
response to one or more of photographs 553, 554 or GPS data 1242 or timing data 1243 documenting a completed delivery task, e.g.) for inclusion in wireless signal 454.
<BR><BR> With reference now to flow 24 of FIG. 24 and to other flows 15-19, 23 described above, in some variants, intensive operation 2415 described below may (optionally) be performed in conjunction with one or more intensive operations described above. Alternatively or additionally, one or more extensive operations 2494, 2497, 2498 described below may likewise comprise or be performed in conjunction with one or more extensive operations described above.
<BR><BR> Intensive operation 2415 describes transmitting a wireless signal indicative of a delivery of a package to a device associated with a recipient of the package, the wireless signal indicating at least one of the first unmanned aerial device or
the package or a sender of the package (e.g. data delivery module 154 transmitting a wireless signal 451 indicative of a delivery of a package 2050 into a vicinity of an article 1400 associated with a purchaser of the package 2050, the wireless signal
451 indicating at least one of the 1st UAD 1005 or the package 2050 or a sender 510 of the package 2050).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which primary unit 110 resides in the "first" UAD 1005 or in another device 1010 described herein; in
which the "vicinity" comprises the room in which article 1400 is situated; in which task implementation module 1481 transmits various operating parameters 2126-2128 (specified by a UAD user 226 or package sender 510, e.g.) relating to such delivery.  One
such sequence 2121, for example, may (optionally) comprise an alias 823 or other expression 2122 facilitating an identification of article 1400.  Another such expression 2122 may comprise global positioning system (GPS) or other destination coordinates
605, 606 (of the article 1400, e.g. or of an alternative destination to be used if the "first" UAD 1005 cannot locate the article 1400, e.g.).  Other such parameters may comprise one or more distances 2171-2175; directions 2186-2189; protocol
identifiers, or other such indications 2101-2109 described herein.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for specifying how a delivery is to be performed without undue experimentation or for configuring
other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,156,542 ("Conditional data delivery to remote devices"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,112,475 ("Managing data delivery based on device state"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,090,826 ("Scheduling

("System and method for automatic notification of upcoming delivery of mail item").
<BR><BR> Extensive operation 2494 describes signaling a decision whether or not to reserve a space for a passenger vehicle (e.g. resource reservation module 1156 transmitting a trigger 2118 that is effective to allocate parking space 648 for the use of
car 602).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which the trigger 2118 includes an affirmative decision 2133 (to reserve parking space 648, e.g.) that has been received from a person (user 626, e.g.) aboard the passenger vehicle; in which
secondary unit 1150 resides in UAD 601 or in a stationary unit (at station 520, e.g.) operable to communicate with UAD 601 and in which resource reservation module 1156 maintains one or more records 964 indicating available and unavailable parking spaces
(in the same parking lot, e.g.) monitored by UAD 601.  In some contexts, moreover, UAD 601 may (optionally) perform operation 2494 by hovering or landing in parking space 648 to notify passersby that the space is taken.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for associating a thing or person with another thing or person without undue experimentation or for
configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,196,809 ("System and method for associating an absorbent article with a user"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,180,827 ("Method and apparatus for associating graphic icon in

user profile to a caller identifier").
<BR><BR> Extensive operation 2497 describes signaling a decision whether or not to reserve a specific resource by associating the specific resource with a specific device or with a specific person (e.g. resource reservation module 157 transmitting one or
more triggers 2113, 2120 effective for implementing or broadcasting an association of a sender 510 or device 775 with person 725).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which network 190 comprises one or more systems 4-9 and media 1200, 2100,
2200 as described herein; in which trigger 2113 includes one expression 2122 for the specific resource (sender 510 or device 775, e.g.) and another expression 2122 for the specific entity (device or person, e.g.) with which the specific resource is or
will be associated.  Alternatively or additionally, in some implementations, resource reservation module 1157 may perform operation 2497 by transmitting an indication 2103 that a specific resource (a modular data handling unit 2078, e.g.) not be reserved
for a specific entity (UAD 201, e.g.) by associating the specific resource with another specific entity (UAD 202, e.g.).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which the specific resource can only be associated with one such entity.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for allocating resources without undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions and
devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,204,770 ("Computer-implemented systems and methods for resource allocation"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,200,583 ("Method and system for leasing or purchasing domain names"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,099,339

<BR><BR> Extensive operation 2498 describes responding to an indication of the first unmanned aerial device becoming within a proximity of a mobile device (e.g. proximity detection module 1153 determining whether UAD 1005 has come into a vicinity 2855 of
an earpiece 2861, wristband 2863, or other article 1400 wearable by a person).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which such an article 1400 (comprising device 775, e.g.) is worn by a person 725 who is moving (toward or away from UAD 1005,
e.g.); in which proximity detection module 1153 resides within the (wearable or other mobile) device 775 or within the "first" UAD 1005; in which one or more components of such device are thereby able to detect a proximity of the other device; and in
which proximity detection module 1153 responds by invoking one or more task implementation modules 1130-1139, 1481-1486 described herein.
<BR><BR> A first device may "become within" a proximity of a second device by one or both such devices moving toward the other.  Each proximity detection module 1153 may, in some instances, operate by having a sensor as a component of a first device that
detects the other device becoming close enough to the sensor to be detected by the sensor, irrespective of which device(s) moved.  Alternatively or additionally, some implementations of proximity detection module 1153 may reside remotely from both
devices and may be configured to determine the devices' mutual proximity from their respective coordinates 605, 606.  In some contexts, for example, a proximity of an object may comprise a room (of a patient in a hospital, e.g.) containing the object. 
In others, a proximity (of target 1360, e.g.) may comprise only an immediate vicinity 1371 (within a few centimeters, e.g.) of the object or may comprise an entire surface (desktop 1372, e.g.) on which such an object is positioned.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for computing a difference between locations without undue experimentation or for configuring other
decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,044,798 ("Passive microwave speed and <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B>"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,026,850 ("Apparatus and method for computing location of a moving beacon using time difference

<BR><BR> With reference now to flow 25 of FIG. 25 and to other flows 15-19, 23, 24 described above, in some variants, one or more intensive operations 2511, 2513, 2517 described below may (optionally) be performed in conjunction with one or more
intensive operations described above.  Alternatively or additionally, one or more extensive operations 2592, 2599 described below may likewise comprise or be performed in conjunction with one or more extensive operations described above.
<BR><BR> Intensive operation 2511 describes presenting navigation guidance via a display aboard the first unmanned aerial device while a primary motor of the first unmanned aerial device is not moving the first unmanned aerial device (e.g. triggering
interface control module 1111 to output navigation guidance 2130 via a touchscreen or other display 1172 borne by UAD 1005 after controller 1085 stops motor 1081).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which UAD 1005 includes a secondary unit
1150 that includes one or more media 2110 and in which controller 1085 switches motor 1081 off.  Alternatively or additionally, task implementation module 1131 may perform operation 2511 by displaying guidance 2130 (arrows, words, or other turn-by-turn
navigation instructions for a pedestrian or motor vehicle, e.g.).  In some variants, for example, such guidance 2130 may be outputted locally (to a user 226 via a speaker 1171 or display 1172, 2072 aboard UAD 1005, e.g.) while UAD 1005 is stationary
(tethered or hovering or landed, e.g.).  Alternatively or additionally, in some variants, such task implementation modules 1131, 1132 may be disabled selectively by a signal from controller 1085 (a control signal indicating that motor 1081 is active,
e.g.).
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for providing navigational guidance without undue experimentation or for configuring other
decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,179,287 ("Method and apparatus for communicating map and route guidance information for vehicle navigation"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,170,798 ("Navigation system and operation guidance

instructions with route guidance in a navigation program").
<BR><BR> Intensive operation 2513 describes transmitting navigation guidance via a speaker of the first unmanned aerial device while a primary motor of the first unmanned aerial device is not moving the first unmanned aerial device (e.g. task
implementation module 1132 triggering interface control module 1111 to output navigation guidance 2130 via a speaker 1171 borne by UAD 1005 after controller 1085 disengages motor 1081 from propeller 1071).  This can occur, for example, in a context in
which UAD 1005 includes a secondary unit 1150 that includes one or more media 2110 and in which controller 1085 permits UAD 1005 to idle (drift or land, e.g.) by disengaging one or more primary motors 1081, 1082 thereof from one or more props 1071, 1072
to which it/they correspond (by mechanical coupling, e.g.).  In some variants, for example, such task implementation modules 1131, 1132 may be enabled (so that it is possible for the transmission to coincide with the condition recited in operation 2513,
e.g.) by a signal from a sensor array 1494 positioned adjacent one or more props 1071, 1072 (indicating that they are stopped, e.g.).
<BR><BR> Intensive operation 2517 describes identifying an operating mode of the first unmanned aerial device audibly or visibly while a primary motor of the first unmanned aerial device is not moving the first unmanned aerial device (e.g. task
implementation module 1133 identifying one or more triggers 2111-2120 or operating parameters 2126-2128 relating to how UAD 701 is performing or will perform a current or scheduled task 491-499 so that a person 726 who is carrying UAD 701 can hear or see
such information).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which speaker 1171 can announce such information audibly (in response to a voice menu aboard UAD 701, e.g.) or in which a display 1172, 2072 aboard UAD 701 can present such information
visibly, or both.  This can occur, for example, in a context in which the operating mode(s) that currently apply to the UAD (silent or not, flight permitted or not, e.g.) can be a function of which of the proximate zones 781, 782 currently contain UAD
701.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for reporting current or scheduled operating parameters without undue experimentation or for
configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,203,426 ("Feed protocol used to report status and event information in physical access control system"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,171,318 ("Reporting flash memory

<BR><BR> Extensive operation 2592 describes causing a modular observation unit to be lifted and activated within at most about an hour of the modular observation unit becoming part of the first unmanned aerial device (e.g. an interface control module
1114, motion control module 1158, device activation module 1472, and an engagement structure 2030 of UAD 1005 jointly picking up cargo module 2090 and then activating a data handling unit 2078 thereof).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which
engagement structure 2030 (one or more robotic arms 2039, e.g.) comprise a mechanical linkage 2040 between cargo module 2090 and the remainder of UAD 1005; in which interface control module 1114 transmits one trigger 2115 causing motion control module
1158 to engage one or more motors 1081, 1082 to rotate props 1071, 1072 so that UAD 1005 takes off; and in which interface control module 1114 transmits another trigger 2116 causing device activation module 1472 to acquire image data 1241 by activating a
camera 2071 of data handling unit 2078.  In some variants, for example, trigger 2116 may be configured to actuate post 2006 (sliding it along shaft 2025 rightward, as shown, into recess 2023, e.g.) so that post 2006 engages and supports a modular
observation unit (a package 2050 containing a sensor array 1494, e.g.).  This can occur in a context in which motion control module 1158 positions UAD 1005 so that a topmost portion of package 2050 extends up into groove 2026, for example.  In other
contexts, a user may (optionally) position structure 2030 (relative to package 2050, e.g.) or may otherwise facilitate linkage 2040.  Alternatively or additionally, in some variants, the modular observation unit (a camera 2071 or GPS 1063 in cargo module
2090, e.g.) may be lifted (by engagement structure 2030, e.g.) responsive to an indication of the modular observation unit becoming part of the first unmanned aerial device (a control signal activating engagement structure 2030 or a sensor signal
indicating an activation of engagement structure 2030, e.g.) or to the modular observation unit being activated.  In some variants, moreover, the modular observation unit may be activated (by device activation module 1472, e.g.) responsive to an
indication of the modular observation unit becoming part of the first unmanned aerial device (a control signal activating engagement structure 2030 or a sensor signal indicating an activation of engagement structure 2030, e.g.) or to the modular
observation unit being lifted.  In a context in which UAD 1005 implements UAD 501, moreover, such a user may generate one or more triggers 2111-2120 as described herein (trigger 2116 causing device activation module 1472 to acquire sensor data, e.g.) by
pressing a button 561 (positioned on a cargo module 2090 of UAD 1005, e.g.).
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for aerial motion control without undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions and
devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,962,254 ("Method and system for assisting flight control of a low-flying aircraft"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,931,238 ("Automatic velocity control system for aircraft"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,837,143

remote control of an aircraft").
<BR><BR> Extensive operation 2599 describes signaling a decision whether or not to configure the first unmanned aerial device to continue observing a first person responsive to a prior observation of the first person (e.g. task implementation module 1134
responding to a behavioral indication 2102 from pattern recognition module 1422 by generating a positive or negative decision 2132 about whether to transmit a trigger 2117 instructing UAD 801 to continue one or more tasks 492, 493 that include observing
person 727).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which a portable article 1400 (UAD 701, e.g.) comprising secondary unit 1150 is positioned so that it can observe person 727 (sensing his speech or movements, e.g.); in which an initial task 492
comprises UAD 802 providing image data 1241 or other sensor data (comprising the prior observation, e.g.) to pattern recognition module 1422 for analysis; in which pattern recognition module 1422 comprises one or more of a gesture detection module 1402
or a spoken expression detection module 1403 or an optical condition detection module; and in which a positive behavioral indication 2102 results from one or more recognizable events 1412-1415 being detected.  In some contexts, task implementation module
1134 may be configured so that decision 2132 will generally be negative (contraindicative of monitoring, e.g.) if the behavioral indication 2102 is normal (within expected bounds, e.g.), for example, and will otherwise generally be positive.  In some
variants, moreover, pattern recognition module 1422 may be configured to detect events (a key press input detection event 1415, e.g.) relating to person 727 from other UAD's or systems described herein (a keyboard 1391 or other input 121 of a stationary
primary unit 110, e.g.).  Alternatively or additionally, in some contexts, pattern recognition module 1422 may be configured to transmit a positive or negative behavioral indication 2102 resulting from some other event (a timer expiration, e.g.)
occurring before any of such recognizable events (recognizable by whichever event/condition detection logic 1410 is active, e.g.) are detected.
<BR><BR> Alternatively or additionally, task implementation module 1134 may be configured to perform operation 2599 by responding to one or more attribute indications 2101 (relating to identity, shape, preference, or other such static attributes, e.g.)
of a subject of observation (an item recipient 2850 or other person described herein, e.g.).  Task implementation module 1134 may thus be configured to implement a continued observation of such a subject via a "first" UAD 801 in response to any
combination of (1) one or more indications 2104 that the subject's face 2865 or clothing 728 resembles that of a particular person of interest, (2) one or more indications 2105 that the subject has spoken or otherwise used particular terminology of
interest (a threat or classified program name, e.g.), or (3) one or more indications 2106 that the subject has taken a recognizable action of interest (fired a gun or entered an office 1380, e.g.).  Such recognizable indications 2104-2106 may be based on
the "prior observations" from the "first" UAD 801, from another UAD 802, from another device, or from some combination of these.  In some contexts, for example, such indications 2104-2106 from two or more such devices may be correlated or otherwise
aggregated (by selective retention module 159, e.g.) according to status-indicative data (image data 1241, GPS data 1242, or timing data 1243 indicative of performance, e.g.) from each respective device.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for detecting a particular person or event without undue experimentation or for configuring other
decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,184,914 ("Method and system of person identification by facial image"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,170,532 ("Method and system for identification using a portable wireless communication

identifying a person from a detected eye image").
<BR><BR> With reference now to flow 26 of FIG. 26 and to other flows 15-19, 23-25 described above, in some variants, one or more intensive operations 2611, 2616, 2617 described below may (optionally) be performed in conjunction with one or more intensive
operations described above.  Alternatively or additionally, one or more extensive operations 2693, 2694, 2695 described below may likewise comprise or be performed in conjunction with one or more extensive operations described above.
<BR><BR> Intensive operation 2611 describes causing another unmanned aerial device to capture delivery data relating to the first unmanned aerial device (e.g. device activation module 1471 transmitting one or more requests 373, invitations 374, or other
triggers 2284 that result in UAD 803 acquiring observations of UAD 801 completing a delivery).  Referring to FIG. 8, for example, this can occur in a context in which a tracking control module 149 aboard UAD 803 receives a task description 1252
specifying what audio clips 563, photographs 553, 554 or other records may constitute acceptable delivery data 2253 and in which device activation module 1471 resides in UAD 801 (as the "first" UAD, e.g.) or in a stationary control unit 860 in wireless
communication with UAD 803.  Alternatively or additionally, device activation module 1471 may perform operation 2611 by configuring another UAD (an instance of UAD 1005, e.g.) to indicate an observed result 2223 (a location or other indicator of
incremental success, e.g.) of one or more other tasks 491-499 (incorporating a delivery component, e.g.) being undertaken by a "first" UAD described herein.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for programmatic image capture or other event tracking without undue experimentation or for
configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,149,288 ("Image capture device that records image accordant with predetermined condition and storage medium that stores program"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,004,563
("Method and system for effectively performing event detection using feature streams of image sequences"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,643,686 ("Multi-tiered image clustering by event"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,476,796 ("Image controlling apparatus capable of
controlling reproduction of image data in accordance with event"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,721,640 ("Event based aircraft image and data recording system"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,167,186 ("Video recording device for retroactively reproducing a video image of an
event, while also recording images in real time").
<BR><BR> Intensive operation 2616 describes configuring the first unmanned aerial device not to be equipped with any light sensors (e.g. device configuration module 1475 transmitting a trigger 2119 that causes a robotic arm 2039 affixed to UAD 1005 to
release an optical sensor aboard UAD 1005).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which cargo module 2090 implements an instance of article 1400 that includes a charge-coupled device 1493 or other sensor array 1494 comprising optical sensors; in
which another instance of article 1400 transmits trigger 2119 to robotic arm 2039; in which UAD 1005 implements at least one UAD 801-3 that is capable of navigating to a healthcare or item recipient 2850 or other destination 530 without any need for an
onboard camera 2071 or CCD 1493; and in which a user can readily discern which cargo module 2090 (if any) is being carried by UAD 1005.  In some contexts, for example, an inspection of UAD 1005 would not otherwise provide a user (recipient 2850, e.g.)
with an adequate assurance of privacy.
<BR><BR> Alternatively or additionally, operation 2616 may be performed by an instance of device configuration module 1475 that manufactures UAD 1005 (at a factory, e.g.) as a "blind" device (i.e. lacking light sensors).  This can occur, for example, in
a context in which "first" UAD 1005 implements UAD 801 (of FIG. 8) and in which device configuration module 1475 implements non-optical position sensing (sonar, e.g.) or optical position sensing via optical sensors not borne by UAD 1005 (in a stationary
control unit 860 or aboard a second UAD 802, e.g.).
<BR><BR> Intensive operation 2617 describes causing a data handling device aboard the first unmanned aerial device to contain a task schedule indicating a first future delivery of a first object to a first destination and a second future delivery of a
second object to a second destination (e.g. task implementation module 1134 causing a memory 395 or disk drive 1495 aboard the UAD 1005 to contain several tasks 491-494, 1211-1214 comprising the first future delivery and the second future delivery). 
This can occur, for example, in a context in which task 491 associates (by inclusion in a single common table entry 1225, e.g.) a task identifier 1221 with one or more of a description of the "first" destination (an immediate vicinity 1371 of target
1360, e.g.) or a description of the "first" object (an inhaler 2062, e.g.) or other specifications 1223 (tracking mode, e.g.) pertaining to the first future delivery; in which task 494 associates another task identifier 1221 with one or more of a
description of the "second" destination 530 or a description of the "second" object (a rescued second UAD 202, e.g.) or other specifications 1223 (aborting the delivery if anyone is present, e.g.) pertaining to the second future delivery.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for scheduling deliveries without undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions and
devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,090,826 ("Scheduling data delivery to manage device resources"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,929,559 ("Method of scheduling message delivery in a wireless communication system"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,516,082
("Scheduling delivery of chemical products based on a predicted estimated time of exhaustion"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,437,305 ("Scheduling delivery of products via the internet"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,233,907 ("Parcel or service delivery with partially
scheduled time windows"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,174,305 ("Method and system for scheduling online targeted content delivery"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,985,871 ("Systems and methods for scheduling reoccurring deliveries and pickups"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,826,534
("Agent and method for dynamically scheduling publication in an automated document delivery system"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,238,290 ("System and method for scheduled delivery of a software program over a cable network"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,009,409 ("System
and method for scheduling and controlling delivery of advertising in a communications network").
<BR><BR> Extensive operation 2693 describes causing the first unmanned aerial device to execute a delivery of a single dose of a therapeutic material to a human hand within one minute of an image capture of a portion of the human hand (e.g. task
implementation module 1484 causing UAD 501 to complete a delivery of a single syringe 556 directly into a hand 2864 of a healthcare recipient 2850 or caregiver).  This can occur, for example in a context in which such delivery occurs within a minute
before or after a camera 2836 captures one or more images (photograph 554, e.g.) depicting a palm, finger, or other feature of the hand 2864 distinctive enough to prove the delivery recipient's identity; in which such image(s) also depict the syringe
2061 or other dose clearly enough to prove the delivery occurred; in which the "first" UAD carries at most one (nominal) dose of the therapeutic material at any given time; in which the therapeutic material is highly addictive and expensive; and in which
an installed dispenser or other device configured to administer more than one dose would be vulnerable to break-ins or other abuse.  Alternatively, in some contexts, the only bioactive material borne by UAD 1005 (implementing UAD 501, e.g.) is the single
dose 2064 in a capsule 2063.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, a process step occurs "within" a time interval of an event if the event occurs before or after the process step by an amount of time that does not exceed the time interval.  A device or other module that is configured to
perform an action "within" a time interval may include a timer 1141 or other circuitry configured to ensure such performance.  In fact a module may be "configured to" perform a brief action (of 1-2 seconds, e.g.) within a long interval (of 1-2 minutes,
e.g.), even if the interval is not signaled, in some contexts (in which the performance occurs during a portion of the interval in which the process step is enabled, e.g.).
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, a device is "configured to execute" a task if special-purpose hardware or software aboard the device enables the UAD to actually complete the task.  Likewise a UAD is "configured to execute" a task if such components aboard
the UAD will enable the UAD to complete the task autonomously provided that no overriding instructions ("abort," e.g.) or other intervening events or conditions (blockages, e.g.) prevent such completion.  A component is "aboard" a UAD if it resides in or
on the UAD or is mechanically supported by the UAD (hanging from the UAD by a tether or otherwise affixed to the UAD, e.g.).
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for automatic positioning without undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions and
devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,108,091 ("Automatic position-based guide toy vehicle apparatus"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,027,761 ("Local positioning system for automated lawn mowers"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,869,562 ("Automatic patient
positioning system"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,693,565 ("Method and apparatus for automatically positioning a structure within a field of view"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,502,684 ("Method and system for the automatic piloting of an aircraft on the approach to an
airdrop position"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,942,369 ("Device for the automatic adjustment of the position of the headlights on a motor vehicle"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,931,596 ("Automatic positioning of display depending upon the viewer's location").
<BR><BR> Extensive operation 2694 describes configuring the first unmanned aerial device to execute a delivery of a particular material to a vicinity of a portable device within one minute of an image capture of the vicinity of the portable device (e.g.
task implementation module 1482 responding to a photographic image 2161 depicting a position 1463 right above a cup 1464 of coffee by transmitting a trigger 2112 to one or more dispensers 2038 of UAD 1005, which respond by delivering cream or sugar into
the cup 1464).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which task implementation module 1482 previously transmitted a trigger 2111 commanding one or more flight control modules 151, 152 to guide UAD 1005 approximately to position 1463; in which
camera 2071 comprises a cargo module 2090 carried by a robotic arm 2039 or other support structure 2030 of UAD 1005; and in which camera 2071 captures a video clip 2153 comprising a succession of images 2161, 2162 depicting a top view of cup 1464 via
which an optical condition detection module 1404 may effectively control the alignment of the one or more dispensers 2038 relative to cup 1464.  In some contexts, for example, other preparations (verifying a user preference, e.g.) may occur before the
delivery is completed (during the "one minute," e.g.).  Alternatively or additionally, in some variants, such an image 2161 (suitable for verifying alignment, e.g.) may be obtained via a charge-coupled device 1493 (aboard UAD 1005 or another UAD tasked
with observation, e.g.) or via a stationary-mount surveillance camera 936 (mounted on a building 935 or other stationary object, e.g.).
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for delivering an item to a vicinity of a device without undue experimentation or for configuring
other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,167,786 ("Systems and methods for delivering a medical implant to an anatomical location in a patient"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,822,463 ("Method for delivering a device to a target
location"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,735,631 ("Mail processing system and method of delivering articles to delivery locations therein"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,670,329 ("Systems and methods for delivering drugs to selected locations within the body"); U.S.  Pat. 
No. 7,658,156 ("Apparatus and method for delivering beneficial agents to subterranean locations"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,361,183 ("Locator and delivery device and method of use"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,711,555 ("Method and apparatus for delivering mail items to
non-postal route locations").
<BR><BR> Extensive operation 2695 describes causing the first unmanned aerial device to execute a delivery of a particular object to a human recipient contemporaneously with an image capture of a portion of the human recipient (e.g. task implementation
module 1483 transmitting one or more triggers 2110, 2116 that configure UAD 1005 to deliver the object to recipient 2850 within about ten seconds of when a camera 2071, 2836 captures an image 2164 of a hand 2864 or face 2865 of the recipient 2850).  This
can occur, for example, in a context in which the object comprises a passive radio frequency identification (RFID) chip 1461, an envelope 551 or other package 2050 (containing an inhaler 2062 or other therapeutic product 2060, e.g.), a data handling unit
2078 (a memory 395 or other medium, e.g.), a battery 2085 or other <B><I>power</I></B> source, a wearable article (earpiece 2861 or wristband 2863, e.g.), a "second" UAD, or similar physical objects.  In some variants, for example, such image capture occurs in
response to one or more triggers from task implementation module 1483.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for determining how one or more portions of a person's body are positioned without undue
experimentation or for configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,978,084 ("Body position monitoring system"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,949,089 ("Apparatus and method for tracking feature's position in human
body"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,934,267 ("Articles of apparel providing enhanced body position feedback"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,916,066 ("Method and apparatus for a body position monitor and fall detector using radar"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,889,913 ("Automatic

human body"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,692,449 ("Methods and system for assessing limb position sense during movement").
<BR><BR> With reference now to flow 27 of FIG. 27 and to other flows 15-19, 23-26 described above, in some variants, one or more intensive operations 2712, 2719 described below may (optionally) be performed in conjunction with one or more intensive
operations described above.  Alternatively or additionally, one or more extensive operations 2795, 2796 described below may likewise comprise or be performed in conjunction with one or more extensive operations described above.
<BR><BR> Intensive operation 2712 describes determining whether or not an operator of the first unmanned aerial device has indicated a tracking mode of the first unmanned aerial device (e.g. interface control module 1110 determining whether any
specifications 1223 provided by a user 226 of UAD 1005 contain any indication 2109 of whether or how any ongoing or future task 491-499, 1211-1214 assigned to UAD 1005 should be tracked).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which user 226
indicates via input 391 (a mouse or keyboard 1391, e.g.) a decision 2131 that a default tracking mode 361 for UAD 1005 (for use in tasks not specifying an exception, e.g.) should be "none" (not record any aspect of tasks performed by UAD 1005, e.g.). 
Alternatively or additionally, such decisions 2131 or specifications 1223 may indicate "periodic" tracking (recording image data 1241, GPS data 1242, wind speed, or other status-indicative data 1240 relating to UAD 1005 periodically, e.g.) with operating
parameter 2127 specifying the tracking period (how long to wait between successive recording events, e.g.) and operating parameter 2128 specifying the source of data to be recorded (event/condition detection logic 1410 or camera 2071, e.g.).
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for task performance monitoring without undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions
and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,171,474 ("System and method for managing, scheduling, controlling and monitoring execution of jobs by a job scheduler utilizing a publish/subscription interface"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,164,461

6,033,316 ("Golf course progress monitor to alleviate slow play").
<BR><BR> Intensive operation 2719 describes overriding a first task being performed by the first unmanned aerial device by transmitting a wireless signal indicative of a second task to the first unmanned aerial device (e.g. task implementation module
1139 transmitting a wireless signal 2192 indicative of a pickup task 1213 and a delivery task 1214 to an interface control module 142 of a UAD 1005 that is performing a lower-priority task 1211).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which
interface control module 142 includes a task scheduler 1220 indicating one or more ongoing, contingent, upcoming, or other tasks 1211-1214; in which task scheduler 1220 earlier received (from one or more task implementation modules 1130-1139, e.g.)
another signal 2191 indicative of the lower-priority task 1211; and in which scalar values 1222 control the respective rankings of the scheduled tasks 1211-1214 so that an intermediate-priority task 1212 (energy replenishment, e.g.) will be performed
before "lower-priority" tasks and after "higher-priority" tasks.  In other variants, however, task implementation module 1139 may be (a) configured to modify the scalar value 1222 of task 1212 (to indicate a higher priority, e.g.) responsive to an
indication that one or more higher priority tasks 1213, 1214 will not be completed (due to capacity limitations, e.g.) without first executing task 1212 or (b) configured to be performed contingently (with a highest priority, but only if a particular
condition (running below a fuel/charge threshold 2294 or other such conditions set forth in the task specification 1223, e.g.) is met.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for ranking tasks without undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions and devices as
described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,200,491 ("Method and system for automatically detecting morphemes in a task classification system using lattices"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,185,536 ("Rank-order service providers based on desired service
properties"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,135,708 ("Relevance ranked faceted metadata search engine"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,095,612 ("Ranking messages in an electronic messaging environment"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,087,019 ("Systems and methods for performing
machine-implemented tasks"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,969,922 ("Apparatus and methods for providing configurable task management of a wireless device"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,945,470 ("Facilitating performance of submitted tasks by mobile task performers"); U.S. 
Pat.  No. 7,885,222 ("Task scheduler responsive to connectivity prerequisites"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,127,300 ("Hardware based dynamic load balancing of message passing interface tasks"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,290,005 ("System for improving the performance of
information retrieval-type tasks by identifying the relations of constituents").
<BR><BR> Extensive operation 2795 describes causing the first unmanned aerial device to fly toward a home station in response to an indication of a specific person moving at least a threshold distance away from the first unmanned aerial device (e.g.
sequence recognition module 1106 transmitting a trigger 423 to a controller 1085, 1095 of the "first" UAD instructing the latter to fly home in response to an outcome of protocol 418 indicating that one or more device-identifiable people 725 have moved
at least a minimum distance 2174 in a direction generally away from the 1st UAD).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which (at least) the navigation of UAD 1005 is locally controlled (via on-board controller 1085, e.g.); in which controller
1085 has access to protocol 418 (implemented therein as a software subroutine or in special-purpose circuitry, e.g.); in which the "first" UAD comprises a helicopter 1002 or other UAD 1005 of FIG. 10 (featuring one or more aspects of UAD's depicted above
in systems 4-9, e.g.); and in which one or more kiosks 250 or other stations 520, 930 are qualifying "home stations" (identified by coordinates 606, a distinctive auditory or optical signal from a beacon 217 near such station(s), or other such
expressions 2122 (in trigger 423, e.g.) useable by a flight control module 151, 152.
<BR><BR> In one context, sequence recognition module 1106 (implementing one embodiment of protocol 418, e.g.) has been notified that entity identification module 144 has detected person 725 being "near" the first UAD--close enough that facial
recognition, proximity sensors 449, or other suitable technologies described herein generate an output 1142 identifying person 725 as the "specific person" and explicitly or otherwise indicating a distance 2171 and direction 2186 of initial separation
(in a 2- or 3-dimensional frame of reference, e.g.).  Sequence recognition module 1106 responds to this notification by iteratively determining (each 0.1 or 1 second, e.g.) where person 725 is relative to her prior position (indicating her movement
distance 2172 and direction 2187, e.g.) and by accumulating the movements (as vector-valued or scalar-valued components, e.g.) and comparing a resultant vector magnitude or other scalar distance 2173 (for at least those iterations in which person 725
moved generally away from the first UAD, e.g.) against the threshold distance 2174.  (It should be noted that device 775 would be moving "generally away" from another UAD 701, situated directly to the south as shown, by moving west-northwest or north or
east-northeast.) In some contexts, sequence recognition module 1106 may be configured to transmit a heading or otherwise-expressed direction 2188 (comprising trigger 423, e.g.) generally toward a (nearest or other) home station 520 relative to UAD 701's
current location, whereby UAD 701 is caused to fly toward home station 520.
<BR><BR> Alternatively or additionally, protocol 418 (implemented in a sequence recognition module 1107 within a controller 1095 remote from a "first" UAD 1005 under its control, e.g.) may make a similar determination of a UAD user 226, 626 (either being
the "specific person") moving at least a threshold distance 2175 (of roughly 1 to 10 meters, within 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, e.g.) away from the first UAD as a manifestation of such user(s) being finished with or otherwise not in need of the first
UAD.  This can occur, for example, in a context in which "first" UAD 1005 has landed or started hovering in a locality in response to sequence recognition module 1107 receiving an indication of such user(s) being near the first UAD (from entity
identification module 144 or proximity sensor 449, e.g.).
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for estimating a distance or movement (of one person or object relative to another, e.g.) without
undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,782,365 ("Enhanced video/still image correlation"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,219,312 ("Determining speed parameters in a geographic area");
U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,219,116 ("Wireless base station location estimation"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,207,869 ("Position estimation for navigation devices"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,138,976 ("Method for position estimation using generalized error distributions"); U.S. 
Pat.  No. 7,592,945 ("Method of estimating target elevation utilizing radar data fusion"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,532,896 ("Wireless node location mechanism using antenna pattern diversity to enhance accuracy of location estimates"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,068,802

reflected light sources").
<BR><BR> Extensive operation 2796 describes responding to a determination of whether or not a received signal expresses a first name of the first unmanned aerial device and whether or not the received signal expresses a second name of the first unmanned
aerial device (e.g. pattern recognition module 1423 transmitting respective results 2224, 2225 of searching a sequence 2121 of characters of an incoming signal 2194 for any instance of the "first" UAD name 1425 or any instance of the "second" UAD name
1426).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which such results 2224, 2225 are each Boolean values ("positive" if found and otherwise "negative," e.g.); in which such names 1425, 1426 are aliases 822, 823 identifying UAD 802; in which control
unit 860 includes storage or transmission media 2100, 2200; and in which instances of article 1400 comprise control unit 860 and reside in network 890.  Alternatively or additionally, in some variants, pattern recognition module 1423 may respond to a
positive search/comparison result (an indication that at least one of the UAD names was found among in signal 2194, e.g.) by programmatically and conditionally invoking one or more device activation modules 1471, 1472 or causing a transmission of one or
more triggers 2111-2120 described herein.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for pattern matching without undue experimentation or for configuring other decisions and devices
as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,209,278 ("Computer editing system for common textual patterns in legal documents"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,209,171 ("Methods and apparatus relating to searching of spoken audio data"); U.S.  Pat.  No.
8,171,567 ("Authentication method and system"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,023,695 ("Methods for analyzing electronic media including video and audio"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,917,514 ("Visual and multi-dimensional search"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,131,540 ("Method and
system for extending keyword searching to syntactically and semantically annotated data").
<BR><BR> Referring again to the flow embodiments of FIGS. 15 and 23-27, other variants of data acquisition module 138 may perform operation 53--obtaining first data indicating that a first unmanned aerial device delivered a first item to a first
entity--by asking for, receiving, and recording (via an interface 390 or other data handling unit 2078 in a vicinity 2855 of an item recipient 2850, e.g.) a spoken confirmation 382 that the item was received.  This can occur, for example, in a context in
which UAD 1005 includes data handling unit 207; in which an engagement structure 2030 of UAD 1005 (post 2006 or robotic arm 2039, e.g.) releases cargo module 490 (a cell phone, e.g.) in a vicinity 2855 of recipient 2850; and in which data acquisition
module 138 triggers the data handling unit 2078 to ask for and cause a recordation of a spoken confirmation 382 (as audio clip 563, for example, obtained by conducting an automated telephone call or similar verbal interchange via data handling unit 2078,
e.g.) from recipient 2850.  In the variants set forth above, for example, operation 53 and one or more others of the above-describe intensive operations may be initiated by processor 365 (executing a respective variant of high-level command 484, e.g.) or
by invoking special-purpose circuitry as described above.
<BR><BR> Other variants of data delivery module 153 may likewise perform operation 84 of flow 15--transmitting via a free space medium the first data to a provider of the first item as an automatic and conditional response to the first data indicating
that the first unmanned aerial device delivered the first item to the first entity, the first data indicating at least one of the first item or the first entity or the first unmanned aerial device--by transmitting (to a sender 510 of cargo module 490,
e.g.) a wireless signal 2195 (via station 520 through air 585, e.g.) containing the recorded spoken confirmation 382 or other data indicating the delivery within a few minutes after data acquisition module 138 obtains such confirmation.  This can occur,
for example, in a context in which one or more systems 5-9 described above implement primary unit 110, in which UAD 1005 implements the "first" UAD, and in which sender 510 would otherwise be unwilling to send cargo module 490 via UAD 1005.  In the
variants set forth above, for example, operation 84 and one or more others of the above-describe extensive operations may be initiated by processor 365 (executing a respective variant of high-level command 485, e.g.) or by invoking special-purpose
circuitry as described above.
<BR><BR> Referring again to the flow variants of FIGS. 16 and 23-27, other variants of coordinate communication module 136 may perform operation 51--obtaining first position data from a first entity, by a second entity, the first entity being a first
unmanned aerial device--by receiving an address 562 from UAD 501 indicating the position of sender 510).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which UAD 501 implements UAD 1005 as described above; in which sender 510 is or has the "first"
resource (a data handling unit 2078 or other package 2050 or product 2060 described herein, e.g.); and in which such resource(s) may be allocated as described herein (purchased or temporarily reserved by the "second" entity, e.g.).  This can occur, for
example, in a context in which the second entity (recipient 2850, e.g.) is remote from the location specified by the first position data (not within the same room or facility, e.g.).  In the variants set forth above, for example, operation 51 and one or
more others of the above-describe intensive operations may be initiated by processor 365 (executing a respective variant of high-level command 484, e.g.) or by invoking special-purpose circuitry as described above.
<BR><BR> Other variants of resource reservation module 156 may likewise perform operation 83 of flow 16--signaling a decision whether or not to allocate a first resource to the second entity after the first position data passes from the first unmanned
aerial device to the second entity, the first resource being associated with the first position data--by transmitting an indication 2107 that a request 373 for such a resource reservation 376 has been declined.  This can occur in a context in which the
first resource is offline or otherwise unavailable, for example, or in which no device is authorized to grant a reservation of the first resource.  In some contexts, for example, resource reservation module 156 may be configured to manage other resources
within a defined zone 781 or of a particular type (products 2060, e.g.).  Alternatively or additionally, in some variants, resource reservation module 156 may be configured to provide (automatically and conditionally, e.g.) one or more signals other than
whether or not to allocate the first resource ("stand by while I contact an authorized agent for you," e.g.).  In the variants set forth above, for example, operation 83 and one or more others of the above-describe extensive operations may be initiated
by processor 365 (executing a respective variant of high-level command 485, e.g.) or by invoking special-purpose circuitry as described above.
<BR><BR> In light of teachings herein, numerous existing techniques may be applied for configuring special-purpose circuitry or other structures effective for associating a user or a device with another user or another device without undue
experimentation or for configuring other decisions and devices as described herein.  See, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 8,023,485 ("Method, system and device for realizing user identity association"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,979,585 ("System and method to associate a
private user identity with a public user identity"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,970,660 ("Identifying associations between items and email-address-based user communities"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,941,505 ("System and method for associating a user with a user profile
in a computer network environment"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,894,812 ("Automatic over-the-air updating of a preferred roaming list (PRL) in a multi-mode device, based on an account association between the device and a wireless local area network (WLAN) access
point"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,743,099 ("Associating multiple visibility profiles with a user of real-time communication system"); U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,716,378 ("System and method to associate a private user identity with a public user identity"); U.S.  Pat.

of input/output device with application programs").
<BR><BR> Referring again to the flow variants of FIGS. 17 and 23-27, other variants of interface control module 141 may perform operation 52--causing a first unmanned aerial device to guide a first individual to a first destination--by signaling via UAD
1005 a direction 2189 of one or more waypoints 642, 742 relative to a current position of the "first" individual along a path to the first destination.  In the context of FIG. 6, for example, an interface control module 141 may be configured to perform
operation 52 by prompting UAD 601 (implementing UAD 1005, e.g.) to signal (via a wireless communication linkage 694, e.g.) a direction of a waypoint 642 to guide a driver (by causing user interface 660 to display an upward arrow to user 626, e.g.) along
a path 643 to the first destination (parking space 648, e.g.).  Another implementation of interface control module 141 may be configured to perform operation 52 by configuring UAD 701 (implementing UAD 1005, e.g.) to signal a direction of a waypoint 742
to guide a pedestrian (via a speaker 1171 or display 1172 aboard UAD 1005, e.g.) along a path 743 (to "first" destination 530, e.g.).  In relation to these variants and others set forth above, operation 52 and one or more others of the above-describe
intensive operations may (optionally) be initiated by processor 365 (executing a respective variant of high-level command 484, e.g.) or by invoking special-purpose circuitry as described above.
<BR><BR> Other variants of flight control module 152 may likewise perform operation 85 of flow 17--causing the first unmanned aerial device to fly to a second destination as an automatic and conditional response to an indication of the first individual
arriving at the first destination--by causing UAD 1005 to fly to the "second" destination after, and responsive to, the "first" individual apparently arriving at a parking space 648 or other "first" destination 530).  This can occur, for example, in a
context in which the "second" destination relates to a task 491-499 to be performed next; in which one or more other conditions, events, or indications 2101-2109 described herein also occur (detected by event/condition detection logic 1410 or signaled by
one or more triggers 2111-2120, e.g.); and in which flight control module 152 implements such flight by triggering a task implementation module 1485 aboard UAD 1005 to activate one or more motors 1081-1083 aboard UAD 1005 controlling one or more props
1071-1073 aboard UAD 1005.  In the variants set forth above, for example, operation 85 and one or more others of the above-describe extensive operations may be initiated by processor 365 (executing a respective variant of high-level command 485, e.g.) or
by invoking special-purpose circuitry as described above.
<BR><BR> Referring again to the flow variants of FIGS. 18 and 23-27, other variants of enlistment module 133 may perform operation 54--indicating a first unmanned aerial device participating in a first task--by notifying device operators (e.g. users 226,
626) or other persons 725, 726 that a "first" task 491-499 (or component task thereof) as described herein has been begun by or accepted on behalf of "first" UAD 1005.  This can occur, for example, in a context in which network 190 contains UAD 1005 and
in which primary unit 110 contains interface device 310 and event/condition detection unit 400.  In the variants set forth above, for example, operation 54 and one or more others of the above-describe intensive operations may be initiated by processor
365 (executing a respective variant of high-level command 484, e.g.) or by invoking special-purpose circuitry as described above.
<BR><BR> Other variants of control unit 860 may likewise perform operation 82 of flow 18--signaling a decision whether or not to cause the first unmanned aerial device to recognize an alias identifying the first unmanned aerial device as an automatic and
conditional response to an indication of the first unmanned aerial device participating in the first task, the alias being different than a primary digital identifier of the first unmanned aerial device--by configuring a name recognition module 147 of
control unit 860 to recognize and use the primary identifier 821 of UAD 1005 (instead of an alias, e.g.) partly based on an indication of UAD 1005 participating in a "first" task 491-499 described herein and partly based on an indication that UAD 1005
has not accepted any aliases 822, 823.  This can occur, for example, in a context in which the decision is negative (not to cause UAD 1005 to recognize any aliases, e.g.); in which control unit 860 makes the negative decision in response to UAD 1005 not
responding to a configuration request within a prescribed interval; in which UAD 1005 implements UAD 802; in which control unit 860 implements primary unit 110; and in which control unit 860 addresses UAD 1005 during such task(s) using primary identifier
821.  Alternatively, in some contexts, UAD 1005 may generate such a negative decision.  In the variants set forth above, for example, operation 82 and one or more others of the above-describe extensive operations may be initiated by processor 365
(executing a respective variant of high-level command 485, e.g.) or by invoking special-purpose circuitry as described above.
<BR><BR> Referring again to the flow variants of FIGS. 19 and 23-27, other variants of tracking control module 977 may perform operation 55--obtaining a tracking mode of a delivery task of a first unmanned aerial device--by receiving a device-executable
command sequence 2125 implementing a user-defined mode 363 of tracking one or more delivery tasks 491, 494 performed or being performed by UAD 1005.  This can occur, for example, in a context in which UAD 1005 implements interface device 310 and media
1200, 2100; in which processor 365 executes device-executable command sequence 2125 (e.g. capturing one or more of image data 1241, GPS data 1242, or timing data 1243) periodically or in response to a trigger 2111-2120 described herein.  Alternatively or
additionally, a one or more user-specified expressions 2122 (expressing rules that incorporate OR, AND, or other logical operators, e.g.) may identify one or more device-detectable indications 2101-2109 that enable or disable such tracking (respectively
as a prerequisite or exception, e.g.).  In the variants set forth above, for example, operation 55 and one or more others of the above-describe intensive operations may be initiated by processor 365 (executing a respective variant of high-level command
484, e.g.) or by invoking special-purpose circuitry as described above.
<BR><BR> Other variants of selective retention module 158 may likewise perform operation 81 of flow 19--signaling a decision whether or not to omit a record of the first unmanned aerial device completing the delivery task of the first unmanned aerial
device as an automatic and conditional response to the tracking mode of the delivery task of the first unmanned aerial device--by transmitting a selection of records 961-964 that are recognized by one or more gesture detection modules 1402, spoken
expression detection modules 1403, optical condition detection modules 1404, or other pattern recognition modules 1421-1423 configured to detect one or more events 1412-1414 (a gesture or word or other expression of acknowledgment from a delivery
recipient 2850, e.g.) specified by the tracking mode (and detectable as visual or auditory phenomena in one or more records 961-964, e.g.).  This can occur, for example, in a context in which a sender 510 of an item delivered decides to specify what
kind(s) of expression (saying "take my picture," e.g.) should trigger tracking; in which the sender 510 expresses such decision(s) as the tracking mode 982; and in which the first UAD 1005 would not otherwise perform any tracking upon completion of one
or more delivery tasks 491, 494.  In the variants set forth above, for example, operation 81 and one or more others of the above-describe extensive operations may be initiated by processor 365 (executing a respective variant of high-level command 485,
e.g.) or by invoking special-purpose circuitry as described above.
<BR><BR> Referring again to flows 15-19 and to variants thereof described with reference to FIGS. 23-27, in some implementations, each of these flows may (optionally) be performed entirely within a "first" unmanned aerial device (in UAD 1005, e.g.) or
within another device described herein.  In some implementations, for example, each of these flows may be performed entirely within a vehicle as described herein (car 602, e.g.) or within a single handheld device (e.g. a cell phone or handheld UAD 202,
701) or in a wearable article (an earpiece 2861, wristband 2863, or similar chip-containing device, for example, or an article of clothing 728 having such a device affixed thereto).  Alternatively or additionally, the first unmanned aerial device may
include the second aerial device (as a cargo module 2090 thereof, e.g.).  In some embodiments, moreover, each of these flows may be performed by a network 1090 of devices or otherwise shared among two or more such devices 1010.

application.  The various singular/plural permutations are not expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.
<BR><BR> The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components.  It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many
other architectures may be implemented which achieve the same functionality.  In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively "associated" such that the desired functionality is achieved.  Hence, any
two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as "associated with" each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components.  Likewise, any two components so
associated can also be viewed as being "operably connected", or "operably coupled," to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being "operably couplable," to each other
to achieve the desired functionality.  Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and/or physically interacting components, and/or wirelessly interactable, and/or wirelessly interacting components, and/or
logically interacting, and/or logically interactable components.
<BR><BR> In some instances, one or more components may be referred to herein as "configured to," "configurable to," "operable/operative to," "adapted/adaptable," "able to," "conformable/conformed to," etc. Those skilled in the art will recognize that
"configured to" can generally encompass active-state components and/or inactive-state components and/or standby-state components, unless context requires otherwise.
<BR><BR> While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing
from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. 
It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as "open" terms (e.g., the term "including" should be interpreted as
"including but not limited to," the term "having" should be interpreted as "having at least," the term "includes" should be interpreted as "includes but is not limited to," etc.).  It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific
number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present.  For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may
contain usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to introduce claim recitations.  However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or
"an" limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to claims containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim 1ncludes the introductory phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or
"an" (e.g., "a" and/or "an" should typically be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one or more"); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.  In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim
recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers, typically means
at least two recitations, or two or more recitations).  Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, and C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would
understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, and C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.).  In
those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, or C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B,
or C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.).  It will be further understood by those within the art that typically a
disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms unless
context dictates otherwise.  For example, the phrase "A or B" will be typically understood to include the possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and B."
<BR><BR> Those skilled in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to implement devices and/or processes and/or systems, and thereafter use engineering and/or other practices to integrate such implemented devices and/or processes and/or
systems into more comprehensive devices and/or processes and/or systems.  That is, at least a portion of the devices and/or processes and/or systems described herein can be integrated into other devices and/or processes and/or systems via a reasonable
amount of experimentation.  Those having skill in the art will recognize that examples of such other devices and/or processes and/or systems might include--as appropriate to context and application--all or part of devices and/or processes and/or systems
of (a) an air conveyance (e.g., an airplane, rocket, helicopter, etc.), (b) a ground conveyance (e.g., a car, truck, locomotive, tank, armored personnel carrier, etc.), (c) a building (e.g., a home, warehouse, office, etc.), (d) an appliance (e.g., a
refrigerator, a washing machine, a dryer, etc.), (e) a communications system (e.g., a networked system, a telephone system, a Voice over IP system, etc.), (f) a business entity (e.g., an Internet Service Provider (ISP) entity such as Comcast Cable,
Qwest, Southwestern Bell, etc.), or (g) a wired/wireless services entity (e.g., Sprint, Cingular, Nextel, etc.), etc.
<BR><BR> In certain cases, use of a system or method may occur in a territory even if components are located outside the territory.  For example, in a distributed computing context, use of a distributed computing system may occur in a territory even
though parts of the system may be located outside of the territory (e.g., <B><I>relay,</I></B> server, processor, signal-bearing medium, transmitting computer, receiving computer, etc. located outside the territory).
<BR><BR> A sale of a system or method may likewise occur in a territory even if components of the system or method are located and/or used outside the territory.  Further, implementation of at least part of a system for performing a method in one
territory does not preclude use of the system in another territory.
<BR><BR> With respect to the numbered clauses and claims expressed below, those skilled in the art will appreciate that recited operations therein may generally be performed in any order.  Also, although various operational flows are presented in a
sequence(s), it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently.  Examples of such alternate orderings may include overlapping, interleaved, interrupted,
reordered, incremental, preparatory, supplemental, simultaneous, reverse, or other variant orderings, unless context dictates otherwise.  Furthermore, terms like "responsive to," "related to," or other past-tense adjectives are generally not intended to
exclude such variants, unless context dictates otherwise.  Also in the numbered clauses below, specific combinations of aspects and embodiments are articulated in a shorthand form such that (1) according to respective embodiments, for each instance in
which a "component" or other such identifiers appear to be introduced (with "a" or "an," e.g.) more than once in a given chain of clauses, such designations may either identify the same entity or distinct entities; and (2) what might be called
"dependent" clauses below may or may not incorporate, in respective embodiments, the features of "independent" clauses to which they refer or other features described above.
