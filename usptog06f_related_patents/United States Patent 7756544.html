       <p> The present invention provides method and systems for activating or
     deactivating network devices by managing the <B><I>power</I></B> of the network device.
     By controlling the <B><I>power</I></B> for network devices, the size and coverage of
     the network can be adjusted to meet the needs for the current usage. This
     can be particularly advantageous in wireless networks where multiple
     wireless access points may be provided to provide coverage during peak
     usage but present the additional security concern of the network being
     accessible to unauthorized users. Being able to <B><I>power</I></B> down unneeded
     wireless access points during off-peak usage allows for the minimization
     of such potential security concerns.

<BR><BR> The present invention generally relates to networking.  More Specifically, it relates to IEEE 802 networking approaches, <B><I>Power</I></B> over the Ethernet (POE) and the access, control, and security of networking.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND INFORMATION
<BR><BR> Typically, network systems are deployed in a manner that provides maximum coverage and connectivity so as to minimize loss of connection during peak usage.  In many instances this involves multiple network devices often deployed in a redundant
or overlapping manner.  One disadvantage of such systems is that during non-peak usage, many of the provided network devices may not be needed and are unnecessarily powered and active.  In addition, the greater the number of active network devices, the
greater the security risk for the system.  That is, each active network device is a potential entry point for intrusion into the network.
<BR><BR> Therefore, what is needed is means of managing the <B><I>power</I></B> for network devices depending on the level of connectivity required by the network.  In this manner, <B><I>power</I></B> consumption and security issues can be minimized when there is low demand on the
network by powering down or deactivating network devices that are not required to provide connectivity.

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR> Certain embodiments of the present invention are described below.  It is, however, expressly noted that the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, but rather the intention is that additions and modifications to what is expressly
described herein also are included within the scope of the invention.  Moreover, it is to be understood that the features of the various embodiments described herein are not mutually exclusive and can exist in various combinations and permutations, even
if such combinations or permutations are not expressly made herein, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
<BR><BR> FIG. 1 depicts a flow chart 100 of one embodiment for a method for managing <B><I>power</I></B> of a network device.  In this example, the first step involves determining one or more operational characteristics of a network associated with the network device
110.  <B><I>Power</I></B> of the network device is then managed based on the one or more operational characteristics of the network.
<BR><BR> The network device can be any number of devices that are connected to and communicate over a network.  Examples of network devices include, but not limited to, routers, bridges, servers, switches, wireless access points, wireless repeaters,
Voice over IP (VoIP) devices, and the like.  Certain embodiments of network devices are discussed in more detail below.
<BR><BR> The network can be a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), a virtual private network (VPN), a wireless network, or any combination thereof.  The network may include a number of network devices for which the <B><I>power</I></B> may be managed. 
Other possible networks will be apparent to one skilled in the art given the benefit of this disclosure.
<BR><BR> With regard to the first step 110 of the method of FIG. 1, operational characteristics can be any number of characteristics or parameters that relate to the operation of network.  Examples of operational characteristics include, but are not
limited to, usage of the network, the state of a primary network link, security of the network, loss of connectivity, bandwidth usage of a link or the network, redundancy in the network, or the like.  There are a wide variety of operational
characteristics which may be useful to help determine the ability to change <B><I>power</I></B> setting and/or increase the security of a network.  Redundancy is a prime characteristic which is used in any algorithm to help make optimal decisions.  In a wireless
network any overlap in the RF coverage area for a set of devices may be part of a network redundancy.  Backup or parallel links in the infrastructure or to attach servers systems are other forms of redundancy.  Certain other examples will be discussed in
greater detail below.  Other embodiments will be apparent to one skilled in the art given the benefit of this disclosure.
<BR><BR> After one or more operational characteristics have been determined, the <B><I>power</I></B> consumption of the device can be managed as seen in step 120 of FIG. 1.  Managing the <B><I>power</I></B> consumption of the network device may involve powering off the device,
powering on the device, placing the device in a cold, warm, or hot standby state, reducing <B><I>power</I></B> to the device, increasing <B><I>power</I></B> to the device, or any combination thereof.  Control signaling may also be used to change the operational parameters of the
device such that the amount of <B><I>power</I></B> consumed by the device is altered.  By managing <B><I>power</I></B> consumption of the network device directly through the sourced <B><I>power</I></B> or indirectly through changes to the operational parameters, the operational characteristics
or parameters of the network device as well as the network itself may be adjusted.  Complex algorithms are often needed to insure little or no loss of network services occur as redundancies in the network are managed and often reduced to facilitate
increases in security and savings in <B><I>power</I></B>.  The algorithms attempt to <B><I>power</I></B> down unneeded resources often removing redundancies and also re-enable these resources before or as they are needed to continuously provide full network services.
<BR><BR> In one example of operation, the state of the primary link of the network device may be determined and, based on the state of the primary link, the <B><I>power</I></B> consumption of a redundant link may be managed to place the redundant link into a standby
state.  In another example of operation, a security event in the network is determined and in response to the security event <B><I>power</I></B> is disabled a network device.  Thus, the suspect network device is disabled.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, <B><I>power</I></B> consumption management may be performed using the IEEE 802.3af standard for <B><I>Power</I></B> over Ethernet (PoE).  <B><I>Power</I></B> over Ethernet (PoE) allows for <B><I>power</I></B> to be delivered over the Ethernet cable to <B><I>power</I></B> network devices.  <B><I>Power
is generally provided by a power</I></B> inserting device (midspan insertion) or by integrating the <B><I>power</I></B> and control logic into a switching or <B><I>relay</I></B> device generally used for packet <B><I>relay</I></B> services in Ethernet based networking systems.  Typically these PoE
systems are managed.
<BR><BR> In another embodiment as shown in FIG. 2, a flow chart 200 is provided for an exemplary method for controlling <B><I>power</I></B> to one or more network communication devices in a network environment.  The first step involves determining one or more
operating characteristics such as an area of the network environment having redundant network access coverage, other redundant capability, or both (step 210).  Parameters of the one or more network communication devices may then adjusted based on the one
or more determined operating characteristics (Step 220).  For example, the size of the area of the network environment having redundant network access coverage, other redundant capability, or both may be changed.  Finally, an action may be taken to
manage <B><I>power</I></B> for at least one of the communications devices based on the size of the area of the network environment having redundant network access coverage, other redundant capability, or both (step 230).  For example, the one or more network device
may be powered down.  The area of the network environment having redundant network access coverage may be provided by wireless access points, redundant links in a topology of the network environment, additional switching capacity, or one or more
additional communication links in a mesh topology.  In certain embodiments the method of FIG. 2 is performed in a network device.  Suitable network devices have been discussed herein above.
<BR><BR> In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 3, the methodology of FIG. 1 is applied to a wireless network.  FIG. 3 shows a flow chart 300 of a method for managing <B><I>power</I></B> of a network device providing wireless connectivity to a network.  In this
embodiment, the first step 310 involves determining one or more operational characteristic such as a state of wireless connectivity provided by the network.  For example, one or more network traffic characteristics, RF <B><I>power</I></B> settings and/or antenna
characteristics for each wireless connection to the network provided by the network device.  The parameters of the wireless network or network device may then be adjusted based on the state of the wireless network in step 320.  This may include moving
wireless users or services, changing QOS requirements, stopping or starting the advertisement of services, altering the frequencies or channels of operation or otherwise altering services.  In step 330 the <B><I>power</I></B> of the network device is managed based on
the state of wireless connectivity.  This may include powering down a network device to conserve <B><I>power</I></B> or placing the device in a reduced <B><I>power</I></B> mode.  In embodiments where the wireless network includes several wireless devices, this process may be
performed for each network device and/or the system as a whole for the coverage area.  Alternately activity of step 320 may be performed after the activity of step 330.  Other steps may added be to move wireless users or services, change QOS
requirements, stop or start advertising services, alter frequencies or channels of operation or otherwise alter services of a single device, sets of devices or the entire system.
<BR><BR> In another example, the <B><I>power</I></B> management of network devices may be based on the presence and required services of a network user.  For example the presence of a user may be determined by detecting the user accessing the wireless network with a
certain application.  In another embodiment, the user may also be detected using other means like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) badge, use of a security pass, motion sensors, or the like.  The operating parameters of one or more network devices
can then be adjusted based on the presence of the user and in turn, the <B><I>power</I></B> consumption.  For security purposes, it may be desirable to <B><I>power</I></B> down certain network devices such as wireless access points or VoIP phones when they are not needed or the
primary user is in another location.  Thus when a user leaves the vicinity of such a network device, the network device may be powered down or set to a low <B><I>power</I></B> mode or services altered to reflex limited use (911 only).  In turn, when a user enters the
vicinity of the network device, the device can then be powered up to provide network access to the user.  Using such a technique it is also possible to have network functionality track with a user through a facility or coverage area.  That is, when a
user moves from a first area to a second area, the network devices in the first area may be powered down and the network devices in the second area powered on.  <B><I>Power</I></B> consumption and security concerns are thus minimized because only necessary network
devices are powered.  Likewise, in certain embodiments, additional network devices may be powered up to increase coverage, QOS requirements, or bandwidth as necessary.  Such techniques may also be applied for multiple users on the network and all
parameters of a policy management system.  That is, <B><I>power</I></B> management may be used to <B><I>power</I></B> up or down network devices as needed to provide coverage as the number of users or service needs on the network changes.
<BR><BR> In certain embodiments, the <B><I>power</I></B> management, such as powering down, of one network device may also require to adjustment of operational characteristics or parameters of other network devices.  For example, if one network device such as a
wireless access point, is powered down, other wireless devices may have their coverage area increased, by changes to their RF transmit <B><I>power</I></B> and receiver sensitivity, to compensate.  In another example, if a network switch is powered down because of a
security event, additional switches or redundant links may be activated to maintain bandwidth and connectivity.  The adjustment of operational parameters of other network devices may be accomplished by control signaling or using the <B><I>power</I></B> management
techniques disclosed herein.
<BR><BR> An example of an embodiment of a network employing <B><I>power</I></B> management of the present invention can be seen in FIG. 4.  Here the network features a number of network devices 410, 430, 440, 470, 480, 500 interconnected over a network 490.  It should
be understood that the network configuration of FIG. 4 is for exemplary purposes to demonstrate different embodiments of network devices.  A network may include any number of network devices in any number of combinations.  Additional network
configuration will be apparent to one skilled in the art given the benefit of this disclosure.
<BR><BR> In this example, network device 410 of FIG. 4 includes the functionality for <B><I>power</I></B> management.  Along with the device functionality 412 that provides for services such as switching, routing, wireless access or VoIP telephony; network device 410
features a port 414 adapted to receive a transmission medium 416 for transmitting a <B><I>power</I></B> signal, a <B><I>power</I></B> module 418; and a control module 424.
<BR><BR> In this example, network device 410 is powered over attached cable 416.  The <B><I>power</I></B> module 418 has circuitry to manage <B><I>power</I></B> consumption of said network device 410 and an input 420 to receive a control signal 422.  The circuitry of the <B><I>power</I></B>
module 418 is configured to, upon receipt of a control signal 422 from the control module 424 take an action to change the level of <B><I>power</I></B> consumption of the network device 410 to provide a selected level of service based on the change in the state of the
network 490.
<BR><BR> The control module 424 is configured to monitor the state of the network 490.  When a change in the state of the network id detected, a control signal 422 is sent from output 426 to the <B><I>power</I></B> module 418.  The state of the network may be based on
any number of the operational characteristics discussed throughout this disclosure.  For example the state of the network may indicate a state of a primary communications link of the network device or the location of a user.  Other possible states of the
network will be apparent to one skilled in the art given the benefit of this disclosure.
<BR><BR> Actions taken by the circuitry of the <B><I>power</I></B> module 418 can include, but are not limited to, powering down the network device, placing the network device in a state of standby such as hot, warm or cold standby, and powering up all or a portion of
the network device.  For example, the action taken may involve managing <B><I>power</I></B> consumption of a portion of the network device associated with a redundant communications link of the network device based on the state of the primary communications link of
the network device such as placing the redundant communication link in a standby state.  Alternately, the receiver portion of a VoIP telephony device may be powered up based on the reception of a call and powered down at the end of a call.
<BR><BR> Network device 430 is an example of a Management and Control Entity (MCE) in switch based and managed implementations of POE where <B><I>power</I></B> is sourced and controlled by the switch 491 or other network controlled device (such as a midspan <B><I>power</I></B>
providing device).  Attached device 480 attached by Ethernet cable 481 may be powered down by the network when desired.  Network device 430 includes a port 432 adapted to receive a transmission medium 434, such as an Ethernet cable, for transmitting a
<B><I>power</I></B> signal and a control module 436 to control a state of the <B><I>power</I></B> signal.  The signals are supplied to a selected other network device (491, 440) by network device 430 in response to a control signal 438 representative of the state of a network
having a selected topology associated with network device 430 or 480.  By controlling the state of the <B><I>power</I></B> signal supplied to the selected other network devices (491, 440) network device 430 is able to increase or reduce the amount of one or more
services provided by the network 490.
<BR><BR> Network device 500 is another example of a Management and Control Entity (MCE).  Here network device includes mechanisms 510, 514, and 518.  Mechanism 510 for controlling delivery of <B><I>power</I></B> over a transmission medium 512 to the one or more
selected network devices (440) is configured to <B><I>power on or power</I></B> off a selected one of the network devices (440) based on an event or requirement for the selected network device.  An example of an event is a network service request such as from a
building access control system or surveillance mechanism 520.  Examples of surveillance mechanism include, but are not limited to, an image acquisition device, a motion detector, a noise detector, an image acquisition device, and a card reader. 
Mechanism 514 determines if a service provided by the selected device is required in the network.  Mechanism 518 is configures to adjust network device parameters to change the state of network access or an area of network coverage.
<BR><BR> Network device 440 is an example of wireless access point utilizing network <B><I>power</I></B> management allowing a user 540 to wirelessly connect to the network.  In addition to the wireless functionality 442 of a wireless access point, network device 440
includes a port 444 for connecting to the network and control mechanism 446 for receiving a control signal 448 from a device such as network devices 430, 470, and 500.  In certain embodiments, network device may further include a beam steering mechanism
450.
<BR><BR> The control mechanism is configured to, in response to the receipt of a control signal from a device such a network devices 430, 470, and 500, takes an action to <B><I>power</I></B> down, <B><I>power</I></B> powering up, reduce an amount of <B><I>power</I></B> consumption, increase an
amount of <B><I>power</I></B> consumption, maintain an amount of <B><I>power</I></B> consumption, or the like.  In embodiments having a beam steering mechanism 450, the beam steering mechanism 450 is configured to, in response to the receipt of a control signal from a device such a
network devices 430, 470, and 500, take an action to provide a selected level of wireless access coverage while conserving an amount of <B><I>power</I></B> consumed of the plurality of wireless access points.  In certain embodiments, only portions of the network
device 440 are <B><I>power</I></B> managed using the techniques herein.
<BR><BR> Network device 470 in another Management and Control Entity (MCE) configured to work with one or more wireless access points (440).  In this example, network device 470 includes a monitoring mechanism 472 and a control mechanism 474.  The
