INVENTION
<BR><BR> The background description is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art or relevant to exemplary embodiments described herein, or that any publication specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art.
<BR><BR> Generally, motor vehicles include a variety of electronic devices for convenience and safety.  Among them few cars and other vehicles provide automatic climate system to maintain a set temperature for the driver and passenger and also provide an
automatic lighting system to illuminate interior of the vehicle and control external lights of the vehicle.  Even many convenience features such as seat adjustments, steering wheel adjustments, automatic mirrors, and the like provide additional
convenience for drivers and passengers.  Also other features such as intelligent airbags are able to discriminate children from adults to prevent deployment for further safety.
<BR><BR> However, existing electronic devices that form part of an automobile have limited capabilities in terms of providing health monitoring by means of various sensors and communicating data/information from such sensors to a remote server/repository
where the data can be assessed/monitored/processed in real-time.  Furthermore, even though few ambulances provide medical assistance, such services/capabilities are not present in normal automobiles/vehicles in general.  Furthermore, existing automobiles
do not attempt to couple, integrate, and/or optimize performance of vehicles based on user's health monitoring output, user's preferences, vehicle characteristics, user's profile, automobile settings, among other automobile related parameters such as
speed, location, among others.  Existing systems also do not efficiently enable transmission of such automobile and/or health information to one or more servers for real-time remote assessment thereof for recommendations/health indications to be put
forth.
<BR><BR> In addition, existing systems/architectures that enable viewing status of and/or controlling home electrical equipment/automation system remotely also have strong limitations.  Existing architectures of such home electrical equipment/automation
systems do not provide a single interface such as a single device for users to monitor their health conditions in automobiles and transmit health related information to a server/repository, wherein the same interface/device also enables the user to
view/process/evaluate status of one or more home automation sensors and control them remotely.
<BR><BR> There is therefore a need in the art for a functional device that enables monitoring of health parameters/conditions of a user and also enables remote viewing/monitoring/controlling of home automation sensors/system.

<BR><BR> According to one embodiment, application 302 that is hosted on the web server 402 can be accessed through establishment of a web socket 404 by means such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or secured HTTP (HTTPS), or any other known
configuration.  In general, Web Sockets is a technology providing for two-way full-duplex communications channels, each over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) socket, and designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers.  The current
standard for Web Sockets is provided by The Web Socket protocol, Network Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Dec.  16, 2009.  The HTTP protocol is intended as a request-response communication method where each request-response
pair requires a web client (typically a web browser) to open a new socket to a web server, perform the communication and then shut down the socket.  A common alternative to HTTP is to provide a secondary communication socket for high-speed data alongside
the HTTP communication channel.  Effectively, the web client communicates via HTTP for the presentation information, and via a separate dedicated socket for high-speed bi-directional data communication.  Therefore, any means to enable any of the
functional device 100 and/or the HAG 202 to access the web application 302 is completely within the scope of the present disclosure.
<BR><BR> FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate an exemplary representations showing user interfaces of the proposed web application 302 in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.  In an aspect, the proposed web application 302 can be accessed on
any computing device including but note limited to laptop, smart phones, mobile phones, tablet PCs', among other like devices, wherein the application can not only be used by users/occupants of the vehicles, but also be other stakeholders such as medical
professionals or health centers, among others that can access health parameters and/or HAS sensor values.  As shown in FIG. 5A, the web application 302 can provide an authentication means 304 that can expect each user, such as an occupant of a vehicle,
to enter a username and password to login, and then access health parameter records, HAS data values from one or more sensors, among other information such as vehicle parameters/attributes, preferences/settings of the occupant among other like
information.  In addition, other users such as doctors or relatives/parents can also view health parameters and/or HAS information and make recommendations/suggestions/reminders that can be visible to the occupants of the vehicle.
<BR><BR> As shown in FIG. 5B, interface of the web application 302 on a functional device 100 can include customer information, customer profile such as name, address, demographic details, preferences, psychographic details, health parameter values, HAS
values, vehicle information, vehicle settings, among other like information, all of which is completely within the scope of the present disclosure.
<BR><BR> FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary representation 600 showing communication between a functional device 100 and a HAG 202 in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.  As shown, functional device 100 that is configured in an
automobile can either be directly coupled with the HAG 202 through cellular or Internet connection and/or can be operatively coupled with the HAD 202 through a web server 602, which can enable access to HAS sensor data, viewing of status of devices
connected with the HAS sensors, and controlling the operation of such devices.
<BR><BR> In an aspect, as mentioned above, functional device 100 can include a user interface that enables the occupant of a vehicle to view the current status of the HAS sensors and control them though either the user interface, or through other means
such as voice, gestures, among others.  In case there is a direct connection between the device 100 and HAG 202, communication means such as SMS, voice based instructions, web-application based instructions, among other like mediums can be incorporated
to enable controlling of the HAS devices such as doors, lights, fans, windows, air conditioners, among others.  Data connection between the HAS 202 and the device 100 can be enabled using, for instance, web sockets or TCP/IP sockets.
<BR><BR> In another aspect, in case communication between the device 100 and the HAG 202 is to take place through a web server such as 602 by means of a web application, a "receive info request" can first be received by the web server 602 in a web socket
from the functional device 100, based on which the request can be processed and format translation/conversion, if necessary can be performed.  The translated request can then be forwarded to the HAG 202 through a second web socket of the web server 602,
wherein response from the HAG giving status/indication of one or more HAS sensors can be received at the second web socket of the server 602, and can then again be processed in the format compatible with the functional device 100.  The processed response
can then be relayed back to the functional device 100 through the first web socket to complete the communication transaction.
<BR><BR> FIG. 7 illustrates another exemplary representation 700 showing communication between a functional device 100 and a HAG 202 in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.  As shown device 100 can be operatively coupled through the
Internet 702 with the HAG 202 by means of one or more network level devices such as routers, switches, hubs, application security appliance (ASA), gateway devices, among other like devices, collectively referred to as 704 hereinafter.  Internet 702 can
further be operatively coupled with web server such as 602 and host a web application using which health parameters, HAS sensor output values, vehicle occupant's profile, vehicle preferences/settings, can be stored, viewed, and customized.
<BR><BR> According to one embodiment, the functional device 100 can directly interact with the HAG 202/remote home automation server through IPSEC VPN tunnel by looking up for the IP address of the other device from an IP table stored in the web server
602 or locally and requesting the data by connecting to that IP address directly.  As mentioned above, by sending a SMS message to the cellular number of the HAG server 202, when the HAG 202 receives the SMS message, it automatically decodes the
instructions and returns the response for the request by an SMS message.  According to one embodiment, apart from IPSec, any other tunneling technologies such as MPLS, ATM/Frame <B><I>Relay,</I></B> IP-in-IP, GRE, L2TP, and GTP can be configured to enable tunnels. 
One skilled in the art will appreciate that this is not an exclusive listing of tunneling technology.
<BR><BR> According to another embodiment, communication can also be established between the device 100 and HAG 202 by means of the web server of either the functional device 100 and/or of the HAG 202.  Such a web server can be launched either from the
CPU 102 of the functional device 100 or from the Wi-Fi module of any other component from within or outside the device (functional device 100 or HAG 202).
<BR><BR> FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary representation showing coupling between a functional device 100 or HAG 202 and an application server 802 in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.  As can be seen, device 100/HAG 202 can be
configured as Virtual Private Network (VPN) client device and can access the application server 802 by means of a secure VPN connection 804 over the Internet.  The VPN connection 804 enables access to a VPN server 804 that is operatively coupled with the
application server 802.  Access to the VPN server 804 can be enabled by means of an enterprise firewall or any other suitable network security device 806.  According to one embodiment, VPN client can be enabled to connect with the VPN server 804 through
WiFi and/or mobile broadband connection or any other known connection means.  According to one embodiment, VPN tunneling protocols can include point-to-point tunneling protocol (PPTP), layer two tunneling protocol (L2TP), and the like, wherein the HAG
202/functional device 100 can be configured in a form factor that is similar to other computing devices such as personal computer (PC), laptop, personal digital assistant (PDA), mobile phones, smart phones, tablet PC's, and the like
<BR><BR> While embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it will be clear that the invention is not limited to these embodiments only.  Numerous modifications, changes, variations, substitutions, and equivalents will be
apparent to those skilled in the art, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as described in the claim.
