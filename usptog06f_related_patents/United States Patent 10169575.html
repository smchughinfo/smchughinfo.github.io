       <p> A computer-implemented method for preventing internal network attacks may
     include 1) identifying a host system that is within a subnet of a
     network, 2) detecting an intrusion on the host system, the intrusion on
     the host system being capable of facilitating an attack via the host
     system on at least one additional system of the network, 3) identifying
     at least one additional host system within the subnet of the network, and
     4) implementing a security measure on the additional host system to
     prevent the attack based at least in part on detecting the intrusion and
     at least in part on the host system and additional host system being
     within the subnet. Various other methods, systems, and computer-readable
     media are also disclosed.

<BR><BR> Consumers and businesses face a growing tide of malicious software that threatens the stability and performance of their computers and the security of their data.  Computer programmers with malicious motivations have created and continue to
create viruses, Trojan horses, worms, and other programs (collectively known as "malware") in an attempt to compromise computer systems.  In an attempt to evade detection, malicious programmers may inject malware into or among legitimate programs.
<BR><BR> Once a network is compromised, the network may become more vulnerable to further attacks.  For example, internal security barriers (e.g., between systems on the network) may be lower than security barriers between the network and outside
networks.  Accordingly, once an attacker has breached the network, further attacks may be launched from within the network.  For example, an attacker may infect additional host systems within the network and/or access sensitive data that is stored within
the network.  Accordingly, the instant disclosure identifies and addresses a need for additional and improved systems and methods for preventing internal network attacks.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR> As will be described in greater detail below, the instant disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for preventing internal network attacks by identifying intrusions on host systems within subnets that may facilitate additional attacks
and implementing security measures in response to the intrusions.  In one example, a computer-implemented method for preventing internal network attacks may include 1) identifying a host system that is within a subnet of a network, 2) detecting an
intrusion on the host system, the intrusion on the host system being capable of facilitating an attack via the host system on at least one additional system of the network, 3) identifying at least one additional host system within the subnet of the
network, and 4) implementing a security measure on the additional host system to prevent the attack based at least in part on detecting the intrusion and at least in part on the host system and additional host system being within the subnet.
<BR><BR> In some examples, the subnet may include a plurality of host systems connected to the network via a gateway, the gateway including at least one security feature for obstructing the attack across the gateway.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, detecting the intrusion may include receiving a message form an endpoint agent on the host system identifying the intrusion.  In these embodiments, implementing the security measure may include transmitting an instruction to
an additional endpoint agent on the additional host to implement the security measure.
<BR><BR> In one example, detecting the intrusion on the host system may include determining that the intrusion cannot be automatically remediated by a security system.  In this example, the computer-implemented method may also include alerting an
administrator of the intrusion.  Furthermore, in this example, implementing the security measure may include preventing the attack until the intrusion is remediated.
<BR><BR> In some examples, implementing the security measure may include transmitting an instruction to an additional endpoint agent on the additional host to implement the security measure.  Additionally or alternatively, implementing the security
measure may include performing a scan for malware on the additional host system.  In some embodiments, implementing the security measure may include adding a firewall restriction to the additional host system.  In one example, implementing the security
measure may include relocating a security endpoint agent on the additional host system to a secure location.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the computer-implemented method may further include 1) identifying a server on the network configured with a first security policy for server transactions not originating from the subnet and a second security policy for
server transactions originating from the subnet and 2) modifying the second security policy to add at least one restriction on server transactions based at least in part on detecting the intrusion.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, a system for implementing the above-described method may include 1) an identification module programmed to identify a host system that is within a subnet of a network, 2) a detection module programmed to detect an intrusion on
the host system, the intrusion on the host system being capable of facilitating an attack via the host system on at least one additional system on the network, 3) a subnet module programmed to identify at least one additional host system within the
subnet of the network, and 4) an implementation module programmed to implement a security measure on the additional host system to prevent the attack based at least in part on detecting the intrusion and at least in part on the host system and additional
host system being within the subnet.  The system may also include at least one processor configured to execute the identification module, the detection module, the subnet module, and the implementation module.
<BR><BR> In some examples, the above-described method may be encoded as computer-readable instructions on a computer-readable-storage medium.  For example, a computer-readable-storage medium may include one or more computer-executable instructions that,
when executed by at least one processor of a computing device, may cause the computing device to 1) identify a host system that is within a subnet of a network, 2) detect an intrusion on the host system, the intrusion on the host system being capable of
facilitating an attack via the host system on at least one additional system of the network, 3) identify at least one additional host system within the subnet of the network, and 4) implement a security measure on the additional host system to prevent
the attack based at least in part on detecting the intrusion and at least in part on the host system and additional host system being within the subnet.
<BR><BR> As will be explained in greater detail below, by identifying intrusions on host systems within subnets that may facilitate additional attacks and implementing security measures in response to the intrusions, the systems and methods described
herein may protect network resources against further intrusions, even when the original intrusions cannot immediately be eliminated (e.g., due to requiring the input of an administrator).

<BR><BR> In certain embodiments, one or more of modules 102 in FIG. 1 may represent one or more software applications or programs that, when executed by a computing device, may cause the computing device to perform one or more tasks.  For example, and as
will be described in greater detail below, one or more of modules 102 may represent software modules stored and configured to run on one or more computing devices, such as the devices illustrated in FIG. 2 (e.g., computing device 202 and host systems
206(1)-(n)), computing system 510 in FIG. 5, and/or portions of exemplary network architecture 600 in FIG. 6.  One or more of modules 102 in FIG. 1 may also represent all or portions of one or more special-purpose computers configured to perform one or
more tasks.
<BR><BR> Exemplary system 100 in FIG. 1 may be implemented in a variety of ways.  For example, all or a portion of exemplary system 100 may represent portions of exemplary system 200 in FIG. 2.  As shown in FIG. 2, system 200 may include a computing
device 202 in communication with host systems 206(1)-(n) via a network 204 (e.g., to manage endpoint security agents on host systems 206(1)-(n)).
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, one or more of modules 102 from FIG. 1 may, when executed by at least one processor of computing device 202, facilitate computing device 202 in preventing internal network attacks.  For example, and as will be described in
greater detail below, one or more of identification module 104, detection module 106, subnet module 108, and implementation module 110 may cause computing device 202 to 1) identify host system 206(1) within a subnet of network 204, 2) detect an intrusion
208 on host system 206(1), intrusion 208 on host system 206(1) being capable of facilitating an attack via host system 206(1) on at least one additional system of network 204, 3) identify at least one additional host system within the subnet of network
204 (e.g., host system 206(n)), and 4) implement a security measure on the host system 206(n) to prevent the attack based at least in part on detecting intrusion 208 and at least in part on host system 206(1) and host system 206(n) being within the
subnet.
<BR><BR> Computing device 202 generally represents any type or form of computing device capable of reading computer-executable instructions.  Examples of computing device 202 include, without limitation, laptops, tablets, desktops, servers, cellular
phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), multimedia players, embedded systems, combinations of one or more of the same, exemplary computing system 510 in FIG. 5, or any other suitable computing device.
<BR><BR> Host systems 206(1)-(n) generally represent any type or form of computing device capable of reading computer-executable instructions.  Examples of computing device 202 include, without limitation, laptops, tablets, desktops, servers, cellular
phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), multimedia players, embedded systems, combinations of one or more of the same, exemplary computing system 510 in FIG. 5, or any other suitable computing device.
<BR><BR> Network 204 generally represents any medium or architecture capable of facilitating communication or data transfer.  Examples of network 204 include, without limitation, an intranet, a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), a
personal area network (PAN), the Internet, <B><I>power</I></B> line communications (PLC), a cellular network (e.g., a GSM Network), exemplary network architecture 600 in FIG. 6, or the like.  Network 204 may facilitate communication or data transfer using wireless or
wired connections.  In one embodiment, network 204 may facilitate communication between computing device 202 and host systems 206(1)-(n).
<BR><BR> FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an exemplary computer-implemented method 300 for preventing internal network attacks.  The steps shown in FIG. 3 may be performed by any suitable computer-executable code and/or computing system.  In some embodiments,
the steps shown in FIG. 3 may be performed by one or more of the components of system 100 in FIG. 1, system 200 in FIG. 2, computing system 510 in FIG. 5, and/or portions of exemplary network architecture 600 in FIG. 6.
<BR><BR> As illustrated in FIG. 3, at step 302 one or more of the systems described herein may identify a host system that is within a subnet of a network.  For example, at step 302 identification module 104 may, as part of computing device 202 in FIG.
2, identify host system 206(1) within a subnet of network 204.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the phrase "host system" may refer to any computing system capable of connecting to a network.  As used herein, the term "subnet" may refer to any subdivision of a network that is configured to communicate with other computing
systems and/or devices outside the subdivision via a networking device (e.g., a router and/or gateway).  For example, the subnet may include a plurality of host systems connected to the network via a gateway, the gateway including at least one security
feature for obstructing an attack across the gateway.  As used herein, the term "gateway" may refer to any networking device capable of connecting a subnet to a network.  For example, the term "gateway" may refer to a gateway device and/or a router.  The
security feature for obstructing the attack may include any of a variety of security features, including a firewall, an <B><I>intrusion prevention system</I></B> (e.g., configured to check network traffic for signatures of exploits, configured to check network traffic
for unusual activity, etc.).
<BR><BR> Identification module 104 may identify the host system in any suitable manner.  For example, as will be explained in greater detail below, one or more of the systems described herein may receive a message from an endpoint agent on the host
system identifying an intrusion on the host system.  Accordingly, identification module 104 may identify the host system by receiving the message from the host system.  Additionally or alternatively, identification module 104 may identify the host system
by identifying a configuration specifying that an endpoint agent operates on the host system.  In some examples, identification module 104 may identify the host system by executing on the host system.  Additionally or alternatively, identification module
104 may identify the host system by receiving a message from another system on the network identifying the host system.
<BR><BR> FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary system 400 for preventing internal network attacks.  As shown in FIG. 4, exemplary system 400 may include a subnet 410 connecting host systems 412, 414, and 416.  Exemplary system 400 may also include a gateway
430 connecting subnet 410 with a security endpoint manager 440 and a database server 450.  Using FIG. 4 as an example, at step 302 identification module 104 may, as a part of modules 102 on security endpoint manager 440, identify host system 412 (e.g.,
by receiving a message from host system 412).
<BR><BR> Returning to FIG. 3, at step 304 one or more of the systems described herein may detect an intrusion on the host system, the intrusion on the host system being capable of facilitating an attack via the host system on at least one additional
system of the network.  For example, at step 304 detection module 106 may, as part of computing device 202 in FIG. 2, detect intrusion 208 on host system 206(1), intrusion 208 on host system 206(1) being capable of facilitating an attack via host system
206(1) on at least one additional system of network 204.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "intrusion" may refer to any malware installation, exploit, and/or attack that may modify the operation of a host system.  As used herein, the term "malware" may refer to any virus, worm, Trojan horse, spyware, and/or
any other malicious, illegitimate, and/or unauthorized software.  As used herein, the term "attack" may refer to any attempt to perform a malware installation, an exploit, an unauthorized use of computing resources, and/or an unauthorized access of data.
<BR><BR> In some examples, detection module 106 may detect the intrusion by receiving a message from an endpoint agent on the host system identifying the intrusion.  As used herein, the phrase "endpoint agent" may refer to any collection of modules,
software, and/or executable code that may be programmed and/or configured to facilitate the security of a host system.  For example, the endpoint agent may include an anti-malware system, a firewall system, and/or an <B><I>intrusion prevention system</I></B>.  In some
examples, the endpoint agent may be configurable by and/or may report to a security endpoint management system.
<BR><BR> In addition to detecting the intrusion, in some examples detection module 106 may determine that the intrusion cannot be automatically remediated by a security system.  For example, detection module 106 may receive a message from an endpoint
agent that the endpoint agent cannot remove malware from the host system and/or cannot stop an intrusion and/or repair an exploit.  For example, the endpoint agent may require further input before proceeding with a remediation and/or may be unable to
eliminate the intrusion with certainty and/or without adverse effects to the host system.  In these examples, one or more of the systems described herein (e.g., detection module 106) may alert an administrator of the intrusion.
<BR><BR> In some examples, detection module 106 may detect the intrusion by detecting and/or receiving a message about a means of the intrusion (e.g., by receiving a message about a malware installation).  Additionally or alternatively, detection module
106 may detect the intrusion by detecting and/or receiving a message about an effect of the intrusion (e.g., unexpected and/or adverse behavior on the host system).
<BR><BR> Using FIG. 4 as an example, at step 304 detection module 106 may, as a part of modules 102 on security endpoint manager 440, receive a message from host system 412 identifying malware 420 (and, e.g., an indication that an endpoint agent on host
system 412 cannot automatically remove malware 420).
<BR><BR> Returning to FIG. 3, at step 306 one or more of the systems described herein may identify at least one additional host system within the subnet of the network.  For example, at step 306 subnet module 108 may, as part of computing device 202 in
FIG. 2, identify at least one additional host system within the subnet of network 204 (e.g., host system 206(n)).
<BR><BR> Subnet module 108 may identify the additional host system in any suitable manner.  For example, subnet module 108 may identify the additional host system by identify a network topology of the network and determining that the additional host
system is within the same subnet as the host system.  Additionally or alternatively, subnet module 108 may identify the additional host system by identifying a security endpoint agent on the additional host system.  In some examples, subnet module 108
may identify the additional host system by reading a configuration file that identifies the additional host system.
<BR><BR> In some examples, subnet module 108 may identify every host system within the subnet.  As will be described in greater detail below, the other host systems in the subnet may be vulnerable to an attack from the host system due to the intrusion.
<BR><BR> Using FIG. 4 as an example, at step 306 subnet module 108 may identify host system 414 and host system 416 as belonging to the same subnet 410 as host system 412.
<BR><BR> Returning to FIG. 3, at step 308 one or more of the systems described herein may implement a security measure on the additional host system to prevent the attack based at least in part on detecting the intrusion and at least in part on the host
system and additional host system being within the subnet.  For example, at step 308 implementation module 110 may, as part of computing device 202 in FIG. 2, implement a security measure on the host system 206(n) to prevent the attack based at least in
part on detecting intrusion 208 and at least in part on host system 206(1) and host system 206(n) being within the subnet.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the phrase "security measure" may refer to any policy, configuration, and/or command for preventing and/or hindering an attack.
<BR><BR> In some examples, implementation module 110 may perform a scan for malware on the additional host system.  Additionally or alternatively, implementation module 110 may increase the aggressiveness of a malware detection policy on the additional
host system (e.g., to use more computing resources in scanning for malware, to more aggressively identify software as malware at the potential cost of more false positives, etc.).  In some examples, implementation module 110 may scan for a malware type
matching malware identified on the host system.
<BR><BR> As another example of the security measure, implementation module 110 may add a firewall restriction to the additional host system.  As used herein, the phrase "firewall restriction" may refer to any policy, rule, and/or configuration for
controlling, filtering, blocking, and/or allowing network traffic.  In some examples, a firewall restriction may identify one or more computing devices, network addresses, and/or network devices.  For example, implementation module 110 may add a firewall
restriction to the additional host system that regulates network traffic from the host system.  Additionally or alternatively, implementation module 110 may add a firewall restriction to the additional host system that regulates network traffic from
within the subnet to the additional host system.
<BR><BR> In some examples, implementation module 110 may relocate a security endpoint agent on the additional host system to a secure location.  For example, implementation module 110 may relocate the security endpoint agent to a location on the network
that may not be reached by an attack from the host system.
<BR><BR> Implementation module 110 may implement the security measure to any of a variety of ends.  For example, implementation module 110 may implement the security measure to prevent the attack until the intrusion is remediated.  Additionally or
alternatively, implementation module 110 may implement the security measure to reverse an attack already performed on the additional host system.  In some examples, implementation module 110 may implement the security measure to prevent an attack from
the additional host system to another system on the network.
<BR><BR> Implementation module 110 may implement the security measure in any suitable manner.  For example, implementation module 110 may implement the security measure by transmitting an instruction to an additional endpoint agent on the additional host
to implement the security measure.  As mentioned earlier, in some examples, subnet module 108 may identify each host system on the subnet (excepting and/or including the host system with the intrusion).  Accordingly, implementation module 110 may
broadcast the instruction to each host system on the subnet.
<BR><BR> In some examples, one or more of the systems may also protect a system on the network but not within the subnet.  For example, implementation module 110 may identify a server on the network configured with a first security policy for server
transactions not originating from the subnet (e.g., server transactions originating from outside the network) and a second security policy for server transactions originating from the subnet (e.g., server transactions originating from within the
network).  The server may perform any of a variety of transactions.  For example, the server may include a database server configured to provide access to data.  In some examples, the first security policy may disallow and/or limit transactions that are
allowed by the second security policy.  In some examples, the second security policy may simply represent an absence of the first security policy.  As used herein, the phrase "security policy" may refer to any policy, configuration, rule, filter,
permission setting, firewall, default, and/or behavior capable of configuring and/or controlling transactions with a computing system.
<BR><BR> Upon identifying the server, implementation module 110 may modify the second security policy to add at least one restriction on server transactions based at least in part on detecting the intrusion.  For example, implementation module 110 may
modify the second security policy to disallow a certain set of server transactions (e.g., access to sensitive data) initiated from the subnet and/or within the network.  In some examples, implementation module 110 may modify the second security policy by
replacing the second security policy and/or adding a policy to constitute to the second security policy.
<BR><BR> As explained above, by identifying intrusions on host systems within subnets that may facilitate additional attacks and implementing security measures in response to the intrusions, the systems and methods described herein may protect network
resources against further intrusions, even when the original intrusions cannot immediately be eliminated (e.g., due to requiring the input of an administrator).
