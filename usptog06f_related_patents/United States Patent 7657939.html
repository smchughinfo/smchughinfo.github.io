</FONT><BR>
       <BR><CENTER><b>Abstract</b></CENTER>
       <p> An <B><I>intrusion detection system,</I></B> and a related method and computer program
     product, for implementing intrusion detection in a remote, on-demand
     computing service environment in which one or more data processing hosts
     are made available to a remote on-demand user that does not have physical
     custody and control over the host(s). Intrusion detection entails
     monitoring resources defined by the on-demand user (or a third party
     security provider) for intrusion events that are also defined by the
     on-demand user (or security provider), and implementing responses
     according to event-action rules that are further defined by the on-demand
     user (or security provider). An <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> agent is
     associated with each of the data processing hosts, and is adapted to
     monitor the intrusion events and report intrusion activity. If there are
     plural <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> agents, they can be individually
     programmed to monitor and report on agent-specific sets of the intrusion
     events. An <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> controller is associated with one
     of the data processing hosts. It is adapted to manage and monitor the
     <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> agent(s), process agent reports of intrusion
     activity, and communicate intrusion-related information to the on-demand
     user (or security provider). The responses to intrusion events can be
     implemented by the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> controller in combination
     with the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> agents, or by any such entity alone.

<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> 1.  Field of the Invention
<BR><BR> The present invention relates to intrusion detection systems.  More particularly, the invention concerns an <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> that operates in a remote, on-demand computing service environment.
<BR><BR> 2.  Description of the Prior Art
<BR><BR> By way of background, many institutional entities purchase or lease computing resources and deploy them physically within their facilities.  Users of these data processing systems will typically connect thereto over an institutional network or,
to a limited degree, the institution may allow trusted individuals some type of VPN (Virtual Private Network) remote access over a public network, such as the Internet.  In either case, the type of access to the data processing system (and by whom) is
known.
<BR><BR> Remote, on-demand computing is a more recent innovation in the data processing field.  According to this model, a customer obtains computing services from a remote computer system that is not under the customer's physical custody and control. 
Instead, the remote system is typically owned by another entity that maintains the system at its own premises.  In some cases, the system owner's equipment used to provide remote, on-demand service may be spread over plural geographic locations, as where
the remote on-demand system comprises a computer grid network with plural interlinked data processing hosts.  A disadvantage of remote, on-demand computing is that it is difficult for the remote user to know whether or not their applications and data are
being accessed by others who may also have access to the same computer equipment, such as a system administrator associated with the on-demand service provider.  On-demand users are generally provided with firewall protection implemented on the data
processing hosts assigned to provide the on-demand services.  However, firewalls only block network-originating intrusions, and only based on a fixed set of specific rules.  Events such as a login by an on-premises administrator via a local console are
typically not blocked, or even reported.
<BR><BR> An <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> can detect unusual events and provide a record of suspected activity, regardless of its point of origin.  However, as far as known, intrusion detection has not been offered to remote on-demand users so that they can
monitor intrusion activity on the remote data processing hosts to which they are assigned.  This may cause customers to be reluctant to take advantage of remote, on-demand services.  For example, consider a hardware vendor who wishes to encourage a
proprietary software vendor to test the software vendor's software on the hardware vendor's computing platform.  Given the option of either running the software under a remote, on-demand service model or simply borrowing or renting the hardware and
setting it up at their own facility, a security conscious software vendor may well insist on the latter arrangement.  This is undesirable from the hardware vendor's perspective due to the high capital costs of equipment loaner and leasing programs.
<BR><BR> Accordingly, an <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> is needed that can provide remote on-demand computing service users with the security assurances they require before utilizing such services.  What would be particularly desirable is an <B><I>intrusion
detection system</I></B> for use in a remote, on-demand computing service environment wherein users are provided with a view of the remote data processing resources as though such resources where physically "in house," and wherein the users are fully informed
whenever security has been violated.  Preferably, remote, on-demand service users should have the ability to fully define each type of security event they desire to have monitored and to specify how such events are to be handled.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR> The foregoing problems are solved and an advance in the art is obtained by an <B><I>intrusion detection system,</I></B> and a related method and computer program product, for implementing intrusion detection in a remote, on-demand computing service
environment in which one or more data processing hosts are made available to a remote on-demand user that does not have physical custody and control over the host(s).  Intrusion detection performed by the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> entails monitoring one
or more resources defined by the on-demand user for intrusion events that are also defined by the on-demand user, and implementing responses according to event-action rules that are further defined by the on-demand user.  Alternatively, the resources,
events and responses can be defined by a third party entity, such as a security provider, authorized to act on behalf of the on-demand user.
<BR><BR> According to exemplary implementations of the invention, the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> includes an <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> (IDS) agent associated with each data processing host.  The IDS agent(s) is/are adapted to monitor the user-defined
events and report intrusion activity.  If there are plural IDS agents, they can be individually programmed to monitor agent-specific sets of user-defined intrusion events.  The <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> further includes an <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B>
(IDS) controller associated with one of the data processing hosts.  The IDS controller is adapted to manage and monitor the IDS agent(s), process agent reports of intrusion activity, and communicate intrusion-related information to the on-demand user or
other authorized entity.  User-defined responses to intrusion events can be implemented by the IDS controller in combination with the IDS agent(s), or by any such entity alone. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR> Turning now to the drawing figures, wherein like reference numerals indicate like elements in all of the several views, FIG. 1 illustrates a computer service environment 2 that is adapted to provide remote on-demand service, and which may be
used to host an <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> according to the present invention.  For ease of description, the computer service environment 2 will be hereinafter referred to as an "on-demand environment." In the on-demand environment 2, a computer system 4
is configured with one or more data processing hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n, each of which comprises a conventional combination of data processing hardware, an operating system, and a layer of application software.  The data processing
hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n interact with an on-demand user system 8 that is remote from the system 4.  The system 4 is assumed to be located at a first premises 10 and the on-demand user system 8 is assumed to be located at a second
premises 12.  It is further assumed that the on-demand user system 8 is operated by or on behalf of an on-demand user entity (hereinafter "on-demand user") that does not have physical custody and control over the system 4.  By way of example, the system
4 could be owned and operated by an on-demand service provider and the on-demand user system 8 could be owned and operated by an on-demand user that contracts with the on-demand service provider for use of the system 4 to run the on-demand user's data
processing applications.  A typical on-demand computing contract might result in the on-demand service provider configuring system 4 to operate as a grid or cluster of computers (representing some or all of the data processing hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2,
6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n) that is made available to the on-demand user.  The latter would utilize the processing <B><I>power</I></B> of the grid or cluster to run software that is uploaded to the system 4 via the on-demand user system 8 (or otherwise installed on the
system 4).
<BR><BR> Additional equipment, such as data storage systems 14.sub.1 and 14.sub.2, may be provided as part of the system 4 to support the data processing operations required by the on-demand user system 8.  All of these entities may be interconnected by
way of a network 16 or other communication interface operating according to a conventional protocol, such as TCP/IP.  It should be further understood that the data processing hosts of the system 4 need not all be situated at the premises 10.  As shown in
FIG. 1, the system 4 could include any number of additional data processing nodes or node clusters 18.sub.1, 18.sub.2 .  . . 18.sub.n located at any number of separate premises.  The nodes/clusters 18.sub.1, 18.sub.2 .  . . 18.sub.n could be statically
assigned for use by the on-demand user or they could be dynamically allocated as the on-demand user's data processing requirements fluctuate.
<BR><BR> Although FIG. 1 depicts the data processing hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n of the system 4 as being discrete computing platforms, this need not necessarily be the case.  For example, as shown in FIG. 2, the system 4 could be
implemented on a single logically partitionable data processing system.  One example of such a system would be the IBM.RTM.  eServer.TM.  pSeries.RTM.  server from International Business Machines Corporation, running version 5.2 of the IBM.RTM.  AIX.RTM. 5L operating system or the like.  In such an environment, the system 4 would be implemented with a collection of shared data processing hardware resources that include one or more central processing units (CPUs) 20.sub.1, 20.sub.2 .  . . 20.sub.n, a
memory 42, and a set of input/output (I/O) facilities 44.  A logical partition (LPAR) manager 46 would define the data processing hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n of the system 4 by virtualizing the aforementioned hardware resources to
provide a subset of the CPU, memory and I/O resources (i.e., a virtual machine) on behalf of higher level guest operating systems and their applications.  The dynamic logical partitioning capability provided by such a system would allow processor, memory
and I/O slot resources to be added to or deleted from running partitions, or moved between running partitions, without having to reboot partition operating systems.  This would make the implementation of FIG. 2 ideal for dynamically allocating
computational resources on behalf of the on-demand user according to workflow fluctuations.
<BR><BR> Turning now to FIG. 3, an alternative view of the on-demand environment 2 is shown in order to illustrate the operation of an <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 therein according to the principles of the present invention.  FIG. 3 illustrates the
computer system 4 and its data processing hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n, together with the on-demand user system 8.  The <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 is represented by the various labeled software entities residing within each data
processing host 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n, the functions of which will be presently discussed.
<BR><BR> The <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 is adapted to allow an on-demand user to monitor activity on data processing hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n of the system 4, regardless of its point of origin.  Moreover, the on-demand user can
act as if it were the owner of the data processing hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n and the system 4 was physically located at the on-demand user premises 12.  These advantages are obtained by allowing the on-demand user to customize and
control all major aspects of <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> operation even though the on-demand user does not have physical custody and control over the data processing hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n.  In particular, even though another
entity may own and operate the data processing hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n, the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 allows the on-demand user to monitor resources thereon that are defined by the on-demand user for intrusion events that are
likewise defined by the on-demand user, and to implement responses according to event-action rules that are further defined by the on-demand user.
<BR><BR> The resources that the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 can be programmed by the on-demand user to monitor for signs that the system 4 may be compromised are many and varied.  By way of example only, detection capabilities that may be selectively
specified by the on-demand user could include: 1) examining one or more system log files; 2) looking for user files with elevated permissions; 3) checking system binaries; 4) examining files run by time scheduling processes; 5) checking for unauthorized
network services; 6) examining password files 7) searching for hidden files or unusual files designated as suspect by the on-demand user; 8) checking for packet sniffing; 9) checking for port scanning; 10) checking system and network configuration; and
11) examining remote access settings.
<BR><BR> By examining these and other resources, the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 can be customized by the on-demand user to track any relevant intrusion event occurring in the system 4, including hardware events, operating system events, system access
events and network access events.  Activity that does not correspond to a tracked intrusion event for a monitored resource will be allowed to proceed.  Activity that corresponds to a tracked event for a resource being monitored will be handled by way of
responses or response sequences according to the event-action rules defined by the on-demand user.  Such event-action rules can be written using any suitable policy definition language (such as a conventional "if-then-else" policy language of the type
used for policy-based network management).
<BR><BR> The actions taken in response to intrusion events will typically include logging the events and reporting them to the on-demand user via the on-demand user system 8.  Depending on the requirements of the on-demand user, the reporting of response
actions could be triggered by a single intrusion event as well as complex event sequences, such as repeated access attempts from a single potentially hostile source.  In all cases, the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 will maintain a record of unusual
activity in the system 4 (as defined by the on-demand user) so that the on-demand user can review any accesses that took place and validate them.  In addition to the reporting of intrusion events, the actions taken in response to intrusion events may
include remedial actions or action sequences, such as blocking incoming packets at a network port, denying access to a file, etc. To provide additional flexibility, the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 may be programmed to allow event context information to
be specified as part of event-action rules, such as the time when an event occurs.  With this capability, the on-demand user could specify complex rules, such as rules for taking different actions in response to events at different times of day.
<BR><BR> As an example of the manner in which the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 can handle intrusion events based on event-action rules specified by the on-demand user, consider a scenario where an unauthorized root user, possibly an administrator
associated with the on-demand service provider that owns the system 4, logs in and attempts to alter the permissions of a non-root user file.  Assuming the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 is programmed by the on-demand user to track login and user file
permission alteration events, an event-action rule could be triggered that causes a report to be sent to the on-demand user that the login has occurred, and that the user file has had its permissions changed.  The on-demand user could then take action on
its own to rectify the situation, such as to place a telephone call the on-demand service provider.  Alternatively, the on-demand user could specify an event-action rule that causes a remedial action to be performed by the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30. 
For example, the on-demand user could specify that a message be sent to the administrator advising that the file permission change is unauthorized and requesting that the person contact the on-demand user to provide an explanation.
<BR><BR> A further illustration of the manner in which the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 can handle intrusion events would be a scenario where a firewall on one of the data processing hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n (with public network
connectivity) reports unusual intrusion-related activity (e.g. a denial of service attack).  In that case, an event-action rule specified by the on-demand user could provide for an <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> agent (described in more detail below) to call
an API (Application Programming Interface) of a software application running on behalf of the on-demand user.  Depending on the application, the API call could be used to modify the application's operational mode, protect its data, or even perform an
application shutdown depending on the perceived threat level.
<BR><BR> To help facilitate the on-demand user's specification of event-action rules, the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 can be configured with a default set of intrusion criteria based on the system's hardware, operating system, system configuration,
system access and network configuration.  Using a web-browser or other interface supported by the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30, the on-demand user can then modify these criteria as desired.  As described in more detail below, the <B><I>intrusion detection
system</I></B> 30 will store the criteria defined by the on-demand user (which may be the default set of intrusion criteria if no changes are made) in appropriate configuration files.  The <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 will then generate and store the programs
needed to detect intrusion events and the programs needed to implement user-defined actions when necessary.  Recovery sequences for recovering the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 from an error condition can also be configured by the on-demand user, and a
default set of criteria may again be provided by the on-demand service provider to assist the on-demand user in this regard.
<BR><BR> Note that for purposes of the present invention, a default set of security-related criteria is considered to be on-demand user-defined so long as the on-demand user is given the opportunity to either approve or disapprove of at least some
portion thereof, even if the default criteria remain unmodified.  Nor does the invention require that the on-demand user interact with the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 for the purpose of specifying intrusion criteria.  A non-technically savvy on-demand
user may not wish to be bothered with such a task and may instead specify its security needs to personnel associated with the on-demand service provider, who will then edit the necessary files.  Alternatively, the on-demand user may simply accept a
default security policy that is made available by the on-demand security provider.  For example, a service scenario could be implemented wherein the on-demand user is allowed to select one of several security packages offered by the on-demand service
provider.
<BR><BR> A further scenario falling within the scope of the invention would be where an authorized third party security provider (e.g., a security specialist) configures the on-demand user's security preferences by dealing with the on-demand service
provider on behalf of the on-demand user, so that the on-demand user does not have to perform this function.  This scenario is illustrated in FIG. 3 wherein reference numeral 8A represents a third party security provider system situated at a third party
security provider premises 12A.  The security provider could interact with the on-demand user and the on-demand service provider in several ways.  According to one arrangement, the security provider would receive security criteria defined by the
on-demand user, and then specify these criteria to the on-demand service provider on behalf of the on-demand user.  In that case, the security criteria would be on-demand user-defined.  According to an alternative arrangement the security provider would
take a more active role by actually defining the security criteria and specifying these criteria to the on-demand service provider on behalf of the on-demand user.  In that case, the security criteria would be security provider-defined.  The on-demand
user would be aware that security is being provided as a result of having contracted for some level of security protection offered by the security provider, but may not be aware of the security details and may not be considered to have defined the
security criteria, this task having been left to the security provider.  Under any of the third party security provider scenarios above, the security provider can be authorized by the on-demand user to receive all security notifications provided by the
<B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 and respond accordingly.  Alternatively, the security provider could forward all or part of such information to the on-demand user for response.
<BR><BR> In the exemplary implementation of FIG. 3, the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 comprises an <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> (IDS) controller 32 that resides on one of the data processing hosts of the system 4 (e.g., host 6.sub.3).  The <B><I>intrusion
detection system</I></B> 30 further includes <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> (IDS) agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n respectively associated with each data processing host 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n of the system 4.  The IDS agents
34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n are responsible for monitoring user-defined events associated with user-defined resources.  An event/resource definition file 36.sub.1, 36.sub.2, 36.sub.3 .  . . 36.sub.n is respectively maintained at each
data processing host 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n to specify the monitoring operations performed by each IDS agent 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n.  Depending on the programming provided by (or on behalf of) the on-demand user,
the event/resource definition files 36.sub.1, 36.sub.2, 36.sub.3 .  . . 36.sub.n can either be identical to each other, such that each IDS agent 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n tracks the same resources for the same set of intrusion events,
or different event/resource definition files can be specified for each IDS agent.  In the latter case, each event/resource definition file will individually program a respective IDS agent 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n to monitor
agent-specific sets of user-defined intrusion events associated with agent-specific resources.  The IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n use the event/resource definition files 36.sub.1, 36.sub.2, 36.sub.3 .  . . 36.sub.n to monitor
activities occurring on the data processing hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n.  Activities that are not defined as intrusion events are ignored.  Activities that are defined as intrusion events are identified and reported as intrusion
activity by the IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n to the IDS controller 32.
<BR><BR> The IDS controller 32 is the main control center of the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30.  It is adapted to manage and monitor the IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n, interpret agent reports of intrusion event activity, and
communicate intrusion-related information to the on-demand user system 8 (or other location authorized by the on-demand user).  If configured to do so by (or on behalf of) the on-demand user, the IDS controller 32 will also instruct the IDS agents
34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n to implement user-defined remedial actions in response to reported intrusion events.  Alternatively, the IDS controller 32 could directly implement user-defined remedial actions without using the IDS agents
34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n.  Moreover, as described in more detail below, the IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n could implement user-defined remedial actions without involvement of the IDS controller 32.
<BR><BR> With regard to the management and monitoring of the IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n, the IDS controller 32 is responsible for spawning each such software entity as each of the various data processing hosts 6.sub.1,
6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n come online following system startup.  The IDS controller 32 thereafter monitors agent operational status and takes corrective action (e.g., a restart sequence) in the event that an IDS agent 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 . . . 34.sub.n, malfunctions or becomes non-responsive.
<BR><BR> With regard to the receipt and interpretation of reports of intrusion activity provided by the IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n, the IDS controller 32 can be implemented to provide a service interface (e.g., a TCP/IP
network port) that the IDS agents access to report intrusion events.  As each intrusion report is received at the IDS controller 32, it can be processed according to event-action rules specified in a rule set file 38 maintained on the data processing
host (e.g., 6.sub.3) that hosts the IDS controller 32.  This rule set file 38 contains the event-action rules defined by (or on behalf of) the on-demand user, but as indicated above, a default rule set may be provided to establish a starting point for
user customization.  When a specific rule requires that a response action be taken following receipt of an intrusion event report, the IDS controller 32 will orchestrate that action following the lookup in the rule set file 38 (either alone or with
assistance from the IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n).  It will be appreciated that different event-action rules may be specified for each data processing host 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n.
<BR><BR> Although a single rule set file 38 is shown for use by the IDS controller 32 on the data processing host 6.sub.3, an alternative arrangement could be implemented wherein some or all of the event-action rules specified by (or on behalf of) the
on-demand user are maintained in plural rule set files distributed across the data processing hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n (see reference numerals 38.sub.1, 38.sub.2 .  . . 38.sub.n in FIG. 3).  Instead of performing centralized
event-action rule set processing at the IDS controller 32, such processing would be performed in distributed fashion by the IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n relative to their respective local intrusion events.  The IDS agents
34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n could then directly implement user-defined remedial actions and report such activities to the IDS controller 32.
<BR><BR> With regard to response actions involving the communication of intrusion-related information to the on-demand user system 8 (or other location authorized by the on-demand user), the IDS controller 32 can be programmed to log all intrusion
activity and periodically report the log information to the on-demand user (or other entity authorized by the on-demand user).  The frequency of such reports is programmable by (or on behalf of) the on-demand user, and may be based on perceived threat
level and other factors.
<BR><BR> The <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 may further comprise a standby IDS controller 40 that can run on the same data processing host (e.g., 6.sub.3) as the IDS controller 32, or on a different data processing host of the system 4.  The standby IDS
controller 40 is adapted to assume IDS controller functions in the event that the IDS controller 32 fails or is otherwise incapable of performing such functions.  It will be appreciated that the combination of an IDS controller 32, one or more IDS agents
34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n controlled by the IDS controller, and a standby IDS controller 40 provides an <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 in which there is no single point of failure, and in which every data processing host 6.sub.1,
6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n runs independent <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> services monitored by a highly available IDS controller pair.
<BR><BR> It will be seen in FIG. 3 that the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 is a distributed software entity that spans plural data processing hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n.  As shown in FIG. 4, the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 can also
be used in an environment where a single data processing host (e.g., the host 6.sub.3) is the only node providing remote, on-demand service to the on-demand user system 8.  In both the plural host (FIG. 3) and single host (FIG. 4) embodiments, the data
processing host (e.g., the host 6.sub.3) runs both the IDS controller 32 and an IDS agent (e.g., the agent 34.sub.3).
<BR><BR> Turning now to FIG. 5, an exemplary logic flow that can be implemented by the IDS controller 32 during initialization and operation of the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 will be described.  Beginning in step 50, the IDS controller 32 is loaded
for execution on a node of the system 4, such as the data processing host 6.sub.3 in FIGS. 3 and 4.  Depending on implementation specifics, the IDS controller 32 will run within a suitable software execution context on the data processing host 6.sub.3,
which might be an operating system kernel process, a user process with elevated (e.g., root or administrative) privileges, or a combination of the foregoing.  An image of the rule set 38 (if present) will also be created in memory.
<BR><BR> In step 52, the IDS controller 32 spawns the standby controller 40.  For security reasons, the standby controller 40 is spawned on the same node that runs the IDS controller 32 (e.g., the data processing host 6.sub.3).  Alternatively, system
robustness could be improved by hosting the standby controller 40 on a separate node.  In that case, the standby controller 40 would remain operational even if the data processing host 6.sub.3 went down.  However, the security level of the <B><I>intrusion
detection system</I></B> 30 could be affected because the IDS controller 32 and the standby controller 40 would be required to communicate with each other using a network protocol (such as TCP/IP) instead of the interprocess communication that can be used when
these entities run on the same node.
<BR><BR> In step 54, the IDS controller 32 spawns one of the IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n on each node of the system 4 (e.g., data processing host 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n in FIG. 3 or data processing host
6.sub.3 in FIG. 4).  Depending on implementation specifics, the IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n will run within suitable software execution contexts at each host node.  These might be operating system kernel processes, user
processes with elevated (e.g., root or administrative) privileges, or a combination of the foregoing.  Images of the event/resource files 36.sub.1, 36.sub.2, 36.sub.3 .  . . 36.sub.n will also be respectively created in the memories of the respective
data processing hosts 6.sub.1, 6.sub.2, 6.sub.3 .  . . 6.sub.n.
<BR><BR> In step 56, the IDS controller 32 begins monitoring for intrusion events reported by the IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n.  When an intrusion report is received in step 57, the IDS controller 32 responds in step 58 by
implementing actions specified in the rule set 38.  As indicated, this will typically include the logging and reporting of intrusion events to the on-demand user system 8 (or other location authorized by the on-demand user), and may also include the
implementation of user-defined remedial actions.  As indicated above, such remedial actions could be implemented directly by the IDS controller 32, or by submitting action requests to the IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n.  On the
other hand, if the IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n perform their own event-action processing using local rule sets (38.sub.1, 38.sub.2 .  . . 38.sub.n in FIG. 3), the IDS controller 32 will simply receive reports of intrusions and
the actions taken by the agents.  Again, this information will typically be logged by the IDS controller 32 and reported to the on-demand user (or other entity authorized by the on-demand user).
<BR><BR> Turning now to FIG. 6, an exemplary logic flow that can be implemented by the IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n during initialization and operation of the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 30 will be described.  Beginning in step
60, each IDS agent 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n initializes itself and establishes communication with the IDS controller 32.  In step 62, each IDS agent 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n begins monitoring resources identified
in the associated event/resource definition file 36.sub.1, 36.sub.2, 36.sub.3 .  . . 36.sub.n, for intrusion events as defined in the event/resource definition file.  If an intrusion event is detected in step 64, the detecting IDS agent 34.sub.1,
34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n reports the intrusion event to the IDS controller 32 in step 66.  If requested to do so by the IDS controller 32 in step 67, the detecting IDS agent 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.2 will perform a
user-defined remedial action in step 68.  Resource monitoring then resumes.  Alternatively, if the IDS agents 34.sub.1, 34.sub.2, 34.sub.3 .  . . 34.sub.n perform their own event-action processing using local rule sets (38.sub.1, 38.sub.2 .  . . 38.sub.n
in FIG. 3), the detecting IDS agent will perform the required action directly.  It will typically also report the intrusion event and the action taken to the IDS controller 32.
<BR><BR> Accordingly, an <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> for use in a remote, on-demand computing service environment has been disclosed.  It will be appreciated that the inventive concepts may be variously embodied in any of a data processing system, a
machine implemented method, and a computer program product in which programming means are recorded on media for controlling a computer system to perform the required functions.  Exemplary data storage media for storing such programming means are shown by
reference numeral 100 in FIG. 7.  The media 100 are shown as being portable optical storage disks of the type that are conventionally used for commercial software sales.  Such media can store the programming means of the invention, either alone or in
conjunction with an operating system or other software product that incorporates the required functionality.  The programming means could also be stored on portable magnetic media (such as floppy disks, flash memory sticks, etc.) or on magnetic media
combined with drive systems (e.g. disk drives) incorporated in computer platforms.
<BR><BR> Although various embodiments of the invention have been described, it should be apparent that many variations and alternative embodiments could be implemented in accordance with the invention.  It is understood, therefore, that the invention is
not to be in any way limited except in accordance with the spirit of the appended claims and their equivalents.
