<BR><BR> Over time more and more devices are connected through an Internet protocol (IP).  Any device that is connected over IP runs the risk of being compromised by hostile entities and/or malicious code.  The devices that can connect over IP include
smart phones and mobile devices.  Generally, for example, a user must choose to have a lightweight unsecure smart phone or have a heavily weighted device that consumes high <B><I>power</I></B>.  Other devices connected over IP include medical monitoring equipment that
provide status and control but are generally unencrypted and thus vulnerable to attack.  For example, a medical device can be hacked and turned off potentially risking human life.

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR> Described herein is an integrated circuit (IC) (i.e., a chip) such as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a processor chip that provides hack-proof security for embedded systems (e.g., military, civil, medical, automotive and so
forth) while providing voice and data communications security for the global market.  In one example, using the new National Security Agency (NSA) certification processes, fully exportable Suite B algorithms compliant to the NSA standards are embedded in
the IC.  The IC also includes a novel processing architecture and soft IP core.  A complete red side processing element is also embedded in the IC for classic red/black functional partitioning.  A boot ROM and an <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> enable the IC
to be secure and "hack aware" by allowing the IC to detect and react to cyber attacks in real-time.
<BR><BR> As used herein "red" data refers to data that is classified and must be protected from unauthorized individuals.  "Black" data refers to data that is unclassified and does not necessarily need to be protected to the same degree as red data.
<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 1, an IC 100 includes a secure router 104 governed by security policies 106 and coupled to a random access memory (RAM) direct memory access (DMA) channel 108 configured to receive and send data (red or black) from and to a
colorless port 172.  The IC 100 also includes a black data DMA channel 112 configured to receive and send black data from and to a black port 174, a red data DMA channel 118 configured to receive and send red data from and to a red port 184, a
non-volatile RAM DMA 126 channel configured to save and receive black persistent data from a black port 182, a secure boot/key controller 138 and a processor 132.  The IC 100 further includes a memory 144 coupled to the secure boot/key controller 138 and
configured to store critical system keys and credentials.  In one example, the memory 144 is a battery-backed internal storage.  In one example, the security policies 106 may be configured by a user.
<BR><BR> The processor 132 includes suite B protocols 154, an encryption processor 158, an encryption accelerator 162, an intrusion detection module 164, a key management module 166 and a voice encoder (vocoder) 168.  Suite B protocols are NSA protocols
that include the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), cryptographic algorithms for key exchange, digital signatures, and hashing.
<BR><BR> The secure router 104 and the secure boot/key controller 138 are each a hardware element that is referred to in the art as a trusted anchor (sometimes referred to herein as a trust anchor).  The trusted anchor performs a function that is
trusted.  For example, the NSA has approved the trusted anchor to perform a particular function.
<BR><BR> In one example, the IC may be configured to be coupled to an external non-volatile RAM 180.  The external non-volatile RAM 180 includes encrypted communications security (COMSEC) and transmission security (TRANSEC) keys 192, encrypted
credentials 194 (e.g., signatures, passwords and so forth) and encrypted applications 196 (e.g., used in secure boot, secure kernel, key management, Suite B algorithms and vocoders).  The data on the external non-volatile RAM 180 can be loaded through
the port 192 on to the IC 100 and stored decrypted in the internal memory 144.  For example, these applications are loaded at the factory (i.e., before being deployed).
<BR><BR> The external non-volatile RAM 180 may store any persistent data used by the IC 100.  For example, security policies, software applications, encrypted keys and so forth may be stored at the external non-volatile RAM 180.  In one example, data in
the external non-volatile RAM 180 is encrypted.  The internal memory 144 stores encryption keys for decrypting the contents of the external non-volatile RAM 180.
<BR><BR> In this configuration, the processor 132 is physically isolated and any communication with the processor 132 is through the secure router 104 and/or through a secure kernel.
<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 2, an example of a process to boot securely is a process 200.  The IC 100 includes a static built-in boot sequence that allows for protection of the programmable user application software.  This boot process provides data
integrity and authentication of a user's software image, as well as anti-tamper and anti-reverse engineering features through the use of built in decryption.
<BR><BR> The IC 100 receives <B><I>power</I></B> (202) and process 200 fetches an application key (206).  For example, the secure boot/key controller 138 retrieves the application key from the internal memory 144.
<BR><BR> Process 200 validates image (212).  For example, the secure boot/key controller 138 validates the image checking its integrity against credentials loaded into internal memory 144.  In one example, the image includes the application software,
Suite B protocol keys, application credentials, and the security policy 106 for the secure router 104.  Process 200 decrypts the image (220).  For example, the secure boot/key controller 138 decrypts the application image using built-in algorithms and
keys from the internal memory 144.  Once decrypted the secure boot/key controller 138 loads any decrypted algorithm software or application software image into the processor 132 and loads security policies into the secure router 104.
<BR><BR> Process 200 transitions to a secure initial state (226).  For example, once software is decrypted and validated for integrity by the secure boot/key controller 138, the IC 100 transitions to a secure initial state allowing data to flow in and
out of ports 184, 172, and 174 along with execution to begin in the processor 132.
<BR><BR> Process 200 transitions control to programmable application code (230).  For example, the IC transitions control to the programmable application code in the processor 132.
<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 3, an example of a process to handle data with different security classifications is a process 300.  For example, data flow processing within the IC 100 allows for a red or "high" side and a black or "low" side memory or
peripheral devices to be attached.  The IC 100 provides a bridge between the two sides of data and can be used for traditional red/black isolation and separation in communication equipment.  For example, high and low sides of a cross domain guard or any
other processing application where sensitive data processing needs to be isolated from non-sensitive data processing.  While all combinations are possible with the IC 100, process 300 is an example of a typical red data to black data processing
operation.
<BR><BR> Process 300 receives data (302).  For example, the IC 100 receives data provided at the port 184 from the red data DMA 118.
<BR><BR> Process 300 validates the data against a security policy (306).  For example, based on the security policy stored at the secure router 104, the data is validated against the security policy to determine if the data, for example, has the
appropriate headers or specific fields within the data (e.g., source/destination checking, message content checking, hash validation, sequence numbers increasing, CRC checks and so forth).
<BR><BR> Process 300 determines if the data is validated against the security policy (310).  If the data is not validated, process 300 notifies an application of an error (312).  For example, if the data is not validated against the security policy, the
<B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 164 notifies the user application code of a violation.
<BR><BR> If the data is validated against the security policy, process 300 processes the data (320).  For example, the secure router 104 provides the data to the processor 132 for high speed processing.  In one example, the processing is defined by the
user.  In one particular example, the processing could include encryption/decryption, signal processing, cross domain guard, and so forth.
<BR><BR> Process 300 validates the post processing data against the security policy (326).  For example, once the data is processed, the data is transitioned back to the secure router 104 where it is checked against the security policy.
<BR><BR> Process 300 determines if the post processing data is validated (330).  If the post-processing data is not validated, process 300 notifies the application of an error (334).  For example, if the post processing data fails validation against the
security policy, the <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> 164 notifies the user application code of a violation.
<BR><BR> If the post processing data is validated against the security policy, process 300 provides the data to the black data DMA 112 (336).  For example, the data is provided to the black data DMA 112 for transmission out the port 174.
<BR><BR> Referring to FIG. 4, in one example, a computer 400 includes a processor 402, a volatile memory 404, a non-volatile memory 406 (e.g., hard disk) and the user interface (UI) 408 (e.g., a graphical user interface, a mouse, a keyboard, a display,
touch screen and so forth).  The non-volatile memory 406 stores computer instructions 412, an operating system 416 and data 418.  In one example, the computer instructions 412 are executed by the processor 402 out of volatile memory 404 to perform all or
part of the processes described herein (e.g., processes 200 and 300).
<BR><BR> The processes described herein (e.g., processes 200 and 300) are not limited to use with the hardware and software of FIG. 4; they may find applicability in any computing or processing environment and with any type of machine or set of machines
that is capable of running a computer program.  The processes described herein may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of the two.  The processes described herein may be implemented in computer programs executed on programmable
computers/machines that each includes a processor, a non-transitory machine-readable medium or other article of manufacture that is readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and/or storage elements), at least one input device,
and one or more output devices.  Program code may be applied to data entered using an input device to perform any of the processes described herein and to generate output information.
<BR><BR> The system may be implemented, at least in part, via a computer program product, (e.g., in a non-transitory machine-readable storage medium), for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus (e.g., a programmable
processor, a computer, or multiple computers)).  Each such program may be implemented in a high level procedural or object-oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system.  However, the programs may be implemented in assembly or
machine language.  The language may be a compiled or an interpreted language and it may be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.  A
computer program may be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.  A computer program may be stored on a non-transitory
machine-readable medium that is readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer for configuring and operating the computer when the non-transitory machine-readable medium is read by the computer to perform the processes described herein. 
For example, the processes described herein may also be implemented as a non-transitory machine-readable storage medium, configured with a computer program, where upon execution, instructions in the computer program cause the computer to operate in
accordance with the processes.  A non-transitory machine-readable medium may include but is not limited to a hard drive, compact disc, flash memory, non-volatile memory, volatile memory, magnetic diskette and so forth but does not include a transitory
signal per se.
<BR><BR> The processes described herein are not limited to the specific examples described.  For example, the processes 200 and 300 are not limited to the specific processing order of FIGS. 2 and 3, respectively.  Rather, any of the processing blocks of
FIGS. 2 and 3 may be re-ordered, combined or removed, performed in parallel or in serial, as necessary, to achieve the results set forth above.
<BR><BR> While the examples herein referred to processing red and black data, the techniques herein may be used between any two classes of data.  For example, one class of data could be top secret data and another class of data could be merely secret
data.
<BR><BR> The processing blocks (for example, in the processes 200 and 300) associated with implementing the system may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform the functions of the system. 
All or part of the system may be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry (e.g., an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) and/or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit)).  All or part of the system may be implemented using electronic
hardware circuitry that include electronic devices such as, for example, at least one of a processor, a memory, programmable logic devices or logic gates.
<BR><BR> Elements of different embodiments described herein may be combined to form other embodiments not specifically set forth above.  Other embodiments not specifically described herein are also within the scope of the following claims.
