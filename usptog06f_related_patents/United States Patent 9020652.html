<BR><BR>BACKGROUND INFORMATION
<BR><BR> 1.  Field
<BR><BR> The present disclosure relates generally to electrical <B><I>power</I></B> and, in particular, to electrical <B><I>power</I></B> systems.  Still more particularly, the present disclosure relates to a method and apparatus for classifying events in an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> system
using information collected by agents distributed throughout the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> system.
<BR><BR> 2.  Background
<BR><BR> An electrical <B><I>power</I></B> source supplies electrical <B><I>power</I></B> to loads.  The electrical <B><I>power</I></B> source may generate electrical energy from mechanical, chemical, thermal, and/or other types of energy.  The electrical <B><I>power</I></B> source transmits this electrical
energy as electrical <B><I>power</I></B> to the loads.  An electrical <B><I>power</I></B> source may also store electrical energy that has been generated previously.  Electrical <B><I>power</I></B> may be delivered from a number of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> sources to a number of loads using an
electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  An electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid is comprised of a number of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> sources, loads, nodes, and <B><I>power</I></B> lines.  A node is located at a connection of two or more <B><I>power</I></B> lines.
<BR><BR> A smart grid is an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid that gathers, distributes, and performs operations in response to information about the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  This information may include, for example, without limitation, information about <B><I>power use,
power</I></B> generation, <B><I>power</I></B> flow, and other types of parameters in the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.
<BR><BR> A smart grid is enabled using different types of sensing and measurement devices that monitor various parameters in an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid and process information about these parameters.  This information may be distributed to the electrical
<B><I>power</I></B> grid using, for example, a communications network for the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.
<BR><BR> The electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid may use this information to manage changes in <B><I>power</I></B> distribution, <B><I>power</I></B> generation, <B><I>power</I></B> use, and other parameters for the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  In particular, the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid may use the information
generated by the different sensing and measurement devices to maintain desired <B><I>power</I></B> distribution within the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.
<BR><BR> With this type of smart grid, concerns may be present regarding the physical security and information security of the smart grid.  For example, one security concern may be a cyber-attack on the smart grid.  In a cyber-attack, an undesired party,
such as an unauthorized computer system, may take control of one or more portions of the smart grid.  In some case, information may be stolen or manipulated in an undesired manner within the smart grid during a cyber-attack.
<BR><BR> Additionally, with currently available configurations for a smart grid, processing the information acquired by the different sensing and measurement devices across the entire electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid may be more difficult and/or more time-consuming
than desired.  For example, processing the information being distributed across a communications network for the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid to identify events and determine how to respond to those events may be more difficult and/or more time-consuming than
desired.  Therefore, it would be desirable to have a method and apparatus that takes into account at least some of the issues discussed above, as well as other possible issues.

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 1, an illustration of a <B><I>power</I></B> model is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  In this illustrative example, <B><I>power</I></B> model 100 is a three-dimensional <B><I>power</I></B> model.  <B><I>Power</I></B> model 100 may be used to model
electrical <B><I>power</I></B> in an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  More specifically, <B><I>power</I></B> model 100 allows <B><I>power</I></B> flow, <B><I>power</I></B> management, and <B><I>power</I></B> control for an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid to be treated independently of each other.
<BR><BR> As depicted, <B><I>power</I></B> model 100 includes <B><I>power</I></B> flow plane 102, <B><I>power</I></B> management plane 104, and <B><I>power</I></B> control plane 106.  In this illustrative example, <B><I>power</I></B> flow plane 102 includes physical aspects of the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> through an
electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  These physical aspects include electrical physical layer 108, thermal physical layer 110, and physical security 112.
<BR><BR> In this illustrative example, <B><I>power</I></B> management plane 104 and <B><I>power</I></B> control plane 106 include layers 114, which are part of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model.  The Open System Interconnection model is a model of a communications and
computer network architecture divided into seven layers.
<BR><BR> <B><I>Power</I></B> management plane 104 includes functions performed by a centralized computer system to manage the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> in an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  For example, a centralized computer system may communicate with the portion of an
electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid within a boundary to manage the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> within the boundary.
<BR><BR> A boundary provides a separation for portions of an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  The boundary may be, for example, a geographical boundary, an organizational boundary, an administrative boundary, or some other suitable type of boundary.  For example,
an organizational boundary may separate two portions of an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid managed by two different electric providers.
<BR><BR> <B><I>Power</I></B> control plane 106 includes functions performed by components associated with an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid across multiple organizational boundaries.  These components include, for example, processes running on data processing systems
associated with the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  These processes may communicate autonomously to control the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> through the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  As used herein, the term "autonomously" means without human control and/or intervention.
<BR><BR> The depiction of <B><I>power</I></B> model 100 in FIG. 1 is intended as an illustration and not as an architectural limitation for the different illustrative embodiments.  For example, in other illustrative examples, <B><I>power</I></B> model 100 may have layers in
addition to, or in place of, the different layers shown in <B><I>power</I></B> model 100 in FIG. 1.
<BR><BR> The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account one or more different considerations.  For example, the illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that currently used techniques for securing computer networks may not
work as well with a computer network within an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment.
<BR><BR> For example, the illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that some currently available security solutions may be implemented within a centralized system.  However, with other types of architectures, such as, for example, a
distributed system, these currently available security solutions may be less efficient than desired.  In particular, these currently available solutions may be unable to provide a desired level of security with a desired level of speed and/or efficiency.
<BR><BR> The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that currently used solutions for computer networks may be applied to networks in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environments.  These solutions include, for example, checking integrity of messages,
bit counting, data chunking, and other known solutions.  The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that these solutions are applied to <B><I>power</I></B> control plane 106 in <B><I>power</I></B> model 100 for an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment.
<BR><BR> The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that fewer solutions exist for <B><I>power</I></B> management plane 104 and these solutions are not as robust as desired.  Currently used techniques include firewalls and monitoring of the systems.
<BR><BR> The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that security issues may affect <B><I>power</I></B> management plane 104, <B><I>power</I></B> control plane 106, or both <B><I>power</I></B> management plane 104 and <B><I>power</I></B> control plane 106.  These security issues include, for
example, cyber-attacks that may attack one or both of these planes.
<BR><BR> The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that models may be created to protect both of these planes.  These models may connect <B><I>power</I></B> management plane 104 and <B><I>power</I></B> control plane 106 through <B><I>power</I></B> flow plane 102.  These
models, however, are typically limited to known types of security issues.  For example, the models may only identify known types of cyber-attacks.  These models may only take into account events related to known cyber-attacks such as taking over part of
an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid, shutting down a component, or other events that may occur in known cyber-attacks.
<BR><BR> The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that this type of model, however, in many instances, may not provide a level of security that is as high as desired.  These types of models are unable to take into account new types of
cyber-attacks with events that are not currently known.
<BR><BR> The illustrative embodiments also recognize and take into account that many of the currently used techniques for identifying security issues are centralized.  In other words, the processing of information is typically in one location.  As a
result, obtaining information may result in congestion in moving information within the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  Further, the illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that similar events may be treated the same although the origin of those
events may be different.  Thus, the illustrative embodiments provide a method and apparatus for providing security for an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid that may be performed on a distributed level through agents distributed within the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.
<BR><BR> As a result, the illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that it would be desirable to process information generated in the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid to identify events as well as classify the events.  In classifying the events,
identification of events that may indicate the presence of a potential physical attack or cyber-attack may be performed to increase security to a desired level.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 2, an illustration of a block diagram of an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  In this illustrative example, electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200 includes electrical
<B><I>power</I></B> grid 202 and communications network 204.  Electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202 is configured for use with <B><I>power</I></B> flow plane 102 in FIG. 1.  Communications network 204 is configured for use with <B><I>power</I></B> management plane 104 and/or <B><I>power</I></B> control plane 106 in FIG.
1.
<BR><BR> As depicted in this example, electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202 includes number of sources 206, number of loads 208, lines 210, and nodes 212.  Electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202 is configured to deliver electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214 from number of sources 206 to number
of loads 208.  Lines 210 may be used to deliver electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214 from number of sources 206 to number of loads 208.  In this illustrative example, lines 210 take the form of transmission lines.  More specifically, lines 210 take the form of
electrical <B><I>power</I></B> lines.
<BR><BR> Two or more lines in lines 210 are connected at a node in nodes 212.  Nodes 212 transfer electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214 carried in one line in lines 210 to one or more other lines in lines 210.  Nodes 212 include at least one of a line sensor, a
cooperative flexible alternating current transmission system device, an electronic filter, a phase shifter, a transformer, an adapter, a processor unit, and/or other suitable devices.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the phrase "at least one of", when used with a list of items, means that different combinations of one or more of the listed items may be used and only one of each item in the list may be needed.  For example, "at least one of
item A, item B, and item C" may include, for example, without limitation, item A or item A and item B. This example also may include item A, item B, and item C, or item B and item C. In other examples, "at least one of" may be, for example, without
limitation, two of item A, one of item B, and 10 of item C; four of item B and seven of item C; and other suitable combinations.
<BR><BR> In these depicted examples, lines 210 and nodes 212 are interconnected in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  In other words, the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214 through at least one of lines 210 and/or at least one of nodes 212 may affect the flow of
electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214 through other lines 210 and/or nodes 212.  Further, the devices within a node in nodes 212 may affect the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214 through other nodes 212.
<BR><BR> In these illustrative examples, communications network 204 is associated with electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  A first component may be considered to be associated with a second component by being secured to the second component, bonded to the second
component, fastened to the second component, and/or connected to the second component in some other suitable manner.  For example, a first component may be connected to a second component through wires, wirelessly, or in some other manner.  The first
component also may be connected to the second component by a third component.  The first component also may be considered to be associated with the second component by being part of and/or an extension of the second component.
<BR><BR> Communications network 204 includes data processing systems 216 and communications links 223.  Data processing systems 216 are associated with nodes 212.  As one example, data processing systems 216 may be connected by wires to nodes 212.  In
these illustrative examples, each data processing system in data processing systems 216 is associated with a node in nodes 212.  In other illustrative examples, only a portion of nodes 212 may be associated with data processing systems 216.
<BR><BR> As depicted, agents 218 may be implemented in data processing systems 216.  Agents 218 may be implemented using hardware, software, of a combination of the two.  In one illustrative example, agents 218 may be software processed in the form of
program code configured to run on data processing systems 216.
<BR><BR> Agents 218 are associated with at least a portion of nodes 212.  This portion may be some or all of nodes 212.  In these illustrative examples, each of agents 218 runs on a different one of data processing systems 216 in these illustrative
examples.  In this manner, each agent in agents 218 is associated with a node in nodes 212.
<BR><BR> In these depicted examples, when a node in nodes 212 is associated with an agent in agents 218, the node is referred to as control node 213.  In some illustrative examples, a node in nodes 212 may be associated with more than one agent in agents
218.  For example, a data processing system in data processing systems 216 associated with a node in nodes 212 may run more than one of agents 218.
<BR><BR> Communications network 204 allows the exchange of information between agents 218 running on data processing systems 216.  Further, communications network 204 allows the exchange of information between a number of processes running on data
processing system 219 and agents 218.  In these examples, data processing system 219 may be part of operations center 235.  Operations center 235 may be located outside of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  An operator at operations center 235 may monitor
and/or control the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214 through electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202 using communications network 204.
<BR><BR> This exchange of information in communications network 204 occurs using communications links 223 in communications network 204.  For example, agents 218 communicate with each other using communications links 223 in communications network 204.
<BR><BR> Communications links 223 may include at least one of lines 210, wireless communications links 225, wired communications links 227, fiber optic cables 229, and other suitable communications links.  Further, communications network 204 may include
other types of devices, such as, for example, without limitation, switches, routers, and other suitable types of communications devices.  In these depicted examples, communications network 204 may be implemented using an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
<BR><BR> Agents 218 running on data processing systems 216 are part of control system 221 in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200.  In other illustrative examples, control system 221 may include other processes running on other data processing systems. 
These other data processing systems may be located within and/or outside of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  For example, control system 221 may include data processing system 219 in operations center 235.
<BR><BR> In these illustrative examples, control system 221 is configured to control the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214 through electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202 using agents 218.  More specifically, each agent in agents 218 controls the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B>
through the node in nodes 212 associated with the agent.
<BR><BR> In these illustrative examples, agents 218 in control system 221 communicate with each other using communications network 204 to form circuit 220.  Circuit 220 is virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 222 in these examples.  Virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 222 includes
<B><I>power</I></B> flow circuit 242 and <B><I>power</I></B> control circuit 244.  <B><I>Power</I></B> flow circuit 242 is formed within electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  Further, <B><I>power</I></B> flow circuit 242 operates within <B><I>power</I></B> flow plane 102 in FIG. 1.  <B><I>Power</I></B> control circuit 244 is formed within
communications network 204.  <B><I>Power</I></B> control circuit 244 operates within <B><I>power</I></B> control plane 106 in FIG. 1.
<BR><BR> <B><I>Power</I></B> flow circuit 242 is formed in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202 by first end point 230, second end point 232, plurality of nodes 224 in nodes 212, and number of lines 233 in lines 210.  First end point 230 may be selected from one of a source in
number of sources 206 and a node in plurality of nodes 224.  Second end point 232 may be selected from one of a load in number of loads 208 and a node in plurality of nodes 224.
<BR><BR> First end point 230, second end point 232, and plurality of nodes 224 are connected by number of lines 233 in lines 210.  Virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 222 carries portion 231 of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214 in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202 in number of lines 233
in these examples.  Portion 231 may be some or all of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214, depending on the configuration of virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 222.
<BR><BR> <B><I>Power</I></B> flow circuit 242 in virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 222 may share components with a number of other <B><I>power</I></B> flow circuits in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  As one illustrative example, <B><I>power</I></B> flow circuit 242 may share at least a portion of number of
lines 233 with another <B><I>power</I></B> flow circuit.
<BR><BR> For example, a portion of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> flowing in number of lines 233 may or may not have a same starting point as another portion of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> flowing in number of lines 233.  Further, a portion of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B>
flowing in number of lines 233 may or may not be delivered to a same ending point as another portion of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> flowing in number of lines 233.  These different portions of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> flowing in number of lines 233 may be
indistinguishable from each other.  Further, these different portions of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> flowing in number of lines 233 may be indistinguishable in <B><I>power</I></B> flow plane 102 in FIG. 1.
<BR><BR> In these depicted examples, plurality of nodes 224 is selected by agents 218 as a group.  For example, one, some, or all of agents 218 select plurality of nodes 224.  In other words, plurality of nodes 224 for virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 222 is
selected by at least a portion of agents 218 in control system 221.  At least a portion of agents 218 communicates with each other to identify number of agents 226 in agents 218 associated with plurality of nodes 224.
<BR><BR> Number of agents 226 runs on number of data processing systems 228 associated with plurality of nodes 224.  Number of agents 226 running on number of data processing systems 228 forms <B><I>power</I></B> control circuit 244 in virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 222.
<BR><BR> In these examples, the locations of number of data processing systems 228 in <B><I>power</I></B> control circuit 244 may follow the locations of plurality of nodes 224 in <B><I>power</I></B> flow circuit 242 in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  In other words, <B><I>power</I></B> control
circuit 244 may mirror <B><I>power</I></B> flow circuit 242 in these examples.
<BR><BR> Number of agents 226 configures plurality of nodes 224 to be part of <B><I>power</I></B> flow circuit 242 in virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 222.  This configuring of plurality of nodes 224 may be based on a number of policies for number of agents 226.  In some
examples, an agent in number of agents 226 may use more than one policy.
<BR><BR> Further, the configuring of plurality of nodes 224 includes using communications network 204 to select number of lines 233 and reserve a capacity in number of lines 233 for the delivery of portion 231 of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214 through plurality of
nodes 224.  Number of agents 226 in <B><I>power</I></B> control circuit 244 monitors and controls the delivery and flow of portion 231 of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214 through number of lines 233 and plurality of nodes 224 in <B><I>power</I></B> flow circuit 242.
<BR><BR> A line in a <B><I>power</I></B> flow circuit may carry different flows of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214 for different <B><I>power</I></B> flow circuits formed within electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  Different <B><I>power</I></B> control circuits within communications network 204 allow these different
flows of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214 carried in the line to be distinguished from each other in <B><I>power</I></B> control plane 106 in FIG. 1.  In other words, each <B><I>power</I></B> control circuit monitors and controls the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 214 for a particular <B><I>power</I></B> flow
circuit.
<BR><BR> The illustration of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200 in FIG. 2 is not meant to imply physical or architectural limitations to the manner in which different illustrative embodiments may be implemented.  Other components in addition to and/or in
place of the ones illustrated may be used.  Some components may be unnecessary in some illustrative embodiments.  Also, the blocks are presented to illustrate some functional components.  One or more of these blocks may be combined and/or divided into
different blocks when implemented in different illustrative embodiments.
<BR><BR> For example, control process 238 in control system 221 may run on data processing system 219 located outside of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  Control process 238 may communicate with agents 218 through wireless communications links 225.  Control
process 238 may select number of agents 226 in agents 218 for <B><I>power</I></B> control circuit 244.  Further, control process 238 may send commands to number of agents 226 to configure plurality of nodes 224 to be part of <B><I>power</I></B> flow circuit 242.
<BR><BR> In yet other illustrative embodiments, agents 218 may be run on processor units 240 in nodes 212.  For example, processor units 240 may be part of different devices in nodes 212.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 3, an illustration of a block diagram of a plurality of nodes is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  In this illustrative example, plurality of nodes 300 is an example of one implementation for
plurality of nodes 224 in FIG. 2.  Plurality of nodes 300 is part of a circuit in an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid, such as circuit 220 in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202 in FIG. 2.
<BR><BR> As depicted, plurality of nodes 300 includes node 302.  Node 302 is located at the connection of <B><I>power</I></B> line 301 and <B><I>power</I></B> line 303.  Node 302 includes line sensor 306, line sensor 307, control device 308, control device 309, and processor unit
310.  Line sensor 306 and control device 308 are located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 301.  Line sensor 307 and control device 309 are located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 303.
<BR><BR> In this illustrative example, processor unit 310 may be implemented in a number of different devices, such as a data processing system, a node, a sensor, or some other suitable device.  For example, the data processing system may be a data
processing system in data processing systems 216 in FIG. 2.  Examples of processor unit 310 include a digital signal processor, a controller, a central processing unit, a multi-core processor, or some other similar type of hardware component.  Processor
unit 310 is configured for communications with line sensor 306, line sensor 307, control device 308, and control device 309.
<BR><BR> As depicted, agent 318 runs on processor unit 310.  In one illustrative example, agent 318 is implemented in software.  Of course, agent 318 also may be implemented in hardware or a combination of the two.  In other words, one or more processes
performed by agent 318 may be implemented using circuits rather than software run on processor unit 310 in some illustrative embodiments.
<BR><BR> As depicted, agent 318 monitors, tracks, and controls the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 316 through node 302.  Agent 318 includes a number of processes.  These processes include at least one of control device interface process 321, demand and
response system interface process 323, optimization process 325, stabilization process 327, <B><I>power</I></B> flow signaling process 329, advertisement process 331, cyber security process 333, and other processes.  In this illustrative example, cyber security
process 333 may process information to identify and classify events in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.
<BR><BR> Different agents associated with plurality of nodes 300 may be configured to perform different operations, depending on the processes within the different agents.  For example, some agents may be configured to perform only a single operation,
while other agents may be configured to perform four or five different types of operations.
<BR><BR> When agent 318 includes control device interface process 321, demand and response system interface process 323, optimization process 325, stabilization process 327, <B><I>power</I></B> flow signaling process 329, advertisement process 331, and cyber security
process 333, agent 318 is referred to as intelligent <B><I>power</I></B> gateway agent 320.
<BR><BR> Intelligent <B><I>power</I></B> gateway agent 320 may have more memory, more computing resources, and faster data transmission rates as compared to other types of agents.  Intelligent <B><I>power</I></B> gateway agent 320 may be in selected locations in an electrical <B><I>power</I></B>
grid.  These locations are selected to reduce latencies in the exchanging of information, optimize data use, coordinate nodes in plurality of nodes 300 for load-balancing, and reduce the bandwidth used in the exchanging of information.
<BR><BR> In this illustrative example, line sensor 306 and line sensor 307 are configured to send information 319 about a number of parameters for <B><I>power</I></B> line 301 and <B><I>power</I></B> line 303, respectively, to agent 318.  Information 319 includes, for example,
capacity for the <B><I>power</I></B> line, voltage, and/or other suitable information.  A capacity for the <B><I>power</I></B> line may be a thermal capacity.  Further, this capacity may vary with respect to time.
<BR><BR> Information 319 may be sent to agent 318 using a communications network, such as communications network 204 in FIG. 2.  Information 319 is sent to agent 318 in response to an event.  This event may be, for example, without limitation, a request
for information 319, the elapsing of a period of time, a beginning of a cycle in a signal, or some other suitable event.  A request for information 319 may be made in response to a request for a service received by agent 318.  The service may include,
for example, without limitation, translation of data, generation of alerts, providing of an interface for exchanging information, and/or other suitable operations.
<BR><BR> Agent 318 makes determinations about the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> through node 302 using information 319.  Agent 318 sends commands 322 to control device 308 and/or control device 309 based on these determinations.  Control device 308 and
control device 309 are cooperative flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) devices in this illustrative example.  Control device 308 and control device 309 are configured to change the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> 316 through node 302 in
response to receiving commands 322.
<BR><BR> In this illustrative example, agent 318 stores information 319 in database 324 in processor unit 310.  Database 324 is a collection of information.  Further, database 324 may be comprised of a number of processes and/or interfaces for accessing
the collection of information.
<BR><BR> Database 324 may be updated with information 319 when information 319 is received by agent 318.  In other illustrative examples, database 324 may be updated based on an event.  The event may be, for example, without limitation, the elapsing of a
period of time, receiving a request for an update to database 324, or some other suitable event.
<BR><BR> Database 324 is distributed database 341 in these examples.  Distributed database 341 contains information for other nodes in plurality of nodes 300 in addition to node 302.  Distributed database 341 may be associated with all or part of
plurality of nodes 300 in this illustrative example.  For example, agent 318 may send information 319 stored in distributed database 341 in node 302 to other agents in other nodes in plurality of nodes 300.  These other agents may store information 319
in databases associated with these other nodes.  These databases are substantially the same as distributed database 341 in these illustrative examples.
<BR><BR> Further, in these illustrative examples, distributed database 341 may be distributed across organizational boundaries.  In this manner, at least a portion of the agents for plurality of nodes 300 may exchange information across organizational
boundaries to create and/or update distributed database 341.
<BR><BR> As one illustrative example, agent 326 runs on processor unit 328 associated with node 330 in plurality of nodes 300.  Agent 326 receives information 332 and stores information 332 in database 324 in processor unit 328.  Agent 326 also sends
information 332 to agent 318 using a communications network, such as communications network 204 in FIG. 2.  Agent 318 then stores information 332 in database 324 stored in processor unit 310.  In this manner, plurality of nodes 300 may autonomously
update database 324.
<BR><BR> Information is stored in database 324 based on a number of factors.  These factors may include, for example, without limitation, the type of information, the quality of information, a length of time for storage, the availability of storage space
in database 324, and other suitable factors.  The storage of information 319 in database 324 also may be based on a latency and/or throughput of the communications network used by the different agents.
<BR><BR> In these illustrative examples, the agents associated with plurality of nodes 300 exchange information using standard TCP/IP network protocols.  However, in some illustrative examples, the agents may exchange information using mobile objects. 
These mobile objects are program code containing information.  This information may include information for the node, such as capacity information, routing information, and/or other suitable information.  This information may also include, for example,
program code for a new process, new rules and/or policies, software upgrades, and/or other suitable types of information.
<BR><BR> The mobile objects may be sent to agent 318 from an operations center.  Agent 318 reads the mobile object and stores the information within the mobile object.  The mobile object clones itself.  Agent 318 sends these clones to other agents.
<BR><BR> The illustration of plurality of nodes 300 in FIG. 3 is not meant to imply physical or architectural limitations to the manner in which different illustrative embodiments may be implemented.  Other components in addition to and/or in place of
the ones illustrated may be used.  Some components may be unnecessary in some illustrative embodiments.  Also, the blocks are presented to illustrate some functional components.  One or more of these blocks may be combined and/or divided into different
blocks when implemented in different illustrative embodiments.
<BR><BR> For example, in some illustrative embodiments, processor unit 310 may be part of data processing system 334.  Data processing system 334 may be connected to node 302 instead of being included in node 302.  In other illustrative embodiments,
processor unit 310 may be part of control device 308 and/or control device 309 in node 302.
<BR><BR> In other illustrative embodiments, <B><I>power</I></B> lines, in addition to <B><I>power</I></B> line 301 and <B><I>power</I></B> line 303, may be connected to node 302.
<BR><BR> In yet other illustrative examples, sensors in addition to or in place of line sensor 306 and/or line sensor 307 may be associated with <B><I>power</I></B> line 301 and/or <B><I>power</I></B> line 303.  These sensors may be configured to detect parameters, such as, for
example, without limitation, temperature, current flow, <B><I>power</I></B> phase, line tension, a location for the <B><I>power</I></B> lines, and/or other suitable parameters for the <B><I>power</I></B> lines.
<BR><BR> In some illustrative examples, database 324 may be in a storage device connected to plurality of nodes 300.  For example, database 324 may be in a storage device that may be accessed by agent 318 and other agents associated with other nodes in
plurality of nodes 300 using wireless communications links.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 4, an illustration of an agent in the form of a block diagram is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  In this depicted example, agent 400 is an example of one implementation for an agent in agents
218 in FIG. 2.  In some cases, agent 400 may be agent 318 in FIG. 3.  Agent 400 may be implemented using hardware, software, or a combination of the two.
<BR><BR> As depicted, agent 400 comprises classifier 402 and analyzer 404.  Classifier 402 is configured to receive information and process information 406.  Information 406 may be received from, for example, without limitation, one or more sensors
associated with electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202 in FIG. 2, a computer system configured to wirelessly communicate with agent 400 using communications network 204 in FIG. 2, or some other source.
<BR><BR> In some illustrative examples, this information may include an identification of event 408.  In other illustrative examples, agent 400 may be configured to identify event 408 using information 406.
<BR><BR> In these illustrative examples, event 408 may be one of physical event 410 and cyber-event 412.  Physical event 410 is an event that occurs within electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202 in FIG. 2.  For example, physical event 410 may be an event that occurs
with respect to one or more devices in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  In some cases, physical event 410 may be a change in a parameter for a component of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.
<BR><BR> As depicted, physical event 410 may take the form of, for example, without limitation, switching event 414, <B><I>power</I></B> event 416, device event 418, or some other type of physical event.  Switching event 414 is an event that affects connections
between components within electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  For example, switching event 414 may be a connection or disconnection of a load, a <B><I>power</I></B> source, or some other suitable type of component within electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.
<BR><BR> <B><I>Power</I></B> event 416 is an event relating to the <B><I>power</I></B> in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  <B><I>Power</I></B> event 416 may be, for example, without limitation, a change in the demand for <B><I>power,</I></B> a change in the production of <B><I>power,</I></B> a change in the distribution of
<B><I>power,</I></B> a change in the consumption of <B><I>power,</I></B> or some other suitable type of event related to the state of <B><I>power</I></B> within electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  Additionally, <B><I>power</I></B> event 416 may be a voltage reduction across a <B><I>power</I></B> line, a change in the availability
of <B><I>power</I></B> from a renewable energy source, a change in the availability of <B><I>power</I></B> from a storage source, a rerouting of <B><I>power</I></B> flow through one or more <B><I>power</I></B> lines in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202, or some other suitable type of event.
<BR><BR> As depicted, device event 418 is an event relating to the state of devices in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  Device event 418 may be, for example, without limitation, reconfiguration of a protection device, activation of a protection device,
deactivation of a protection device, reconfiguration of a routing device, or some other suitable type of event relating to one or more devices in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.
<BR><BR> In these illustrative examples, a protection device may be, for example, a fuse, a grounding system, a circuit breaker, a <B><I>power relay,</I></B> or some other type of device configured to protect a portion of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  A routing device
may be, for example, a <B><I>relay,</I></B> a transformer, a reactor, or some other suitable type of device used to route <B><I>power</I></B>.
<BR><BR> Cyber-event 412 is an information event or a computer-based event.  For example, cyber-event 412 may take the form of message 420.  Message 420 may be information of any type.  In one illustrative example, message 420 may take the form of
command 422, request 424, or some other suitable type of information
<BR><BR> Command 422 may be a directive to agent 400 to perform an action within electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  Command 422 may also be referred to as a request for an action to be performed.  Request 424 may be a request for information acquired by agent
400 and/or one or more other agents.  In some cases, processing of command 422 and request 424 may result in an action that in turn, results in an event such as, for example, without limitation, event 408.  Thus, message 420 also may be a cause of an
event.
<BR><BR> In these illustrative examples, classifier 402 is configured to classify event 408.  In one illustrative example, classifier 402 classifies event 408 as one of normal expected event 430, abnormal expected event 432, normal unexpected event 434,
abnormal unexpected event 436, or some other suitable classification for an event.
<BR><BR> Event 408 is classified as normal expected event 430 when event 408 is an event that normally occurs and is expected from operation of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  Normal expected event 430 may include, for example, without limitation, at least
one of the connection of a load, the disconnection of a load, the connection of a <B><I>power</I></B> source, the disconnection of a <B><I>power</I></B> source, a reconfiguration of a <B><I>power</I></B> routing device, an activation or deactivation of a switchgear during a scheduled maintenance
activity, a fluctuation of <B><I>power</I></B> within selected tolerances and/or lasting less than a selected threshold of time, and other suitable types of normal expected events.
<BR><BR> Event 408 is classified as abnormal expected event 432 when event 408 does not occur during normal operation of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202, but is expected during operation of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  Abnormal expected event 432 may include,
for example, without limitation, at least one of a voltage flicker, a short circuit, an insulation breakdown, an initiation of a backup operation, harmonics distortion, a cut <B><I>power</I></B> line, a voltage reduction, an outage, an emergency event, and other
suitable types of abnormal expected events.
<BR><BR> Further, event 408 is classified as normal unexpected event 434 when event 408 is not expected to occur during normal operation of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202, but is within selected tolerances for normal operation of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202. 
In other words, normal unexpected event 434 is an event that is within operational limits for normal operation of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202, but that is not expected.
<BR><BR> Normal unexpected event 434 may include, for example, without limitation, at least one of an increase in <B><I>power</I></B> consumption, an increase in <B><I>power</I></B> generation, a rerouting of <B><I>power</I></B> flow, and other suitable types of normal unexpected events.  Normal
unexpected events may be within selected limits but unexpected based on sensor data from electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.
<BR><BR> Event 408 is classified as abnormal unexpected event 436 when event 408 is an event that does not normally occur and is not expected to occur during the operation of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  Abnormal unexpected event 436 may include, for
example, without limitation, at least one of a cyber-security breach, a hostile intrusion in communications network 204 associated with electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202, stolen equipment, damaged equipment, and other types of abnormal unexpected events.
<BR><BR> Analyzer 404 in agent 400 is configured to determine whether to initiate number of actions 438 based on the classification of event 408.  In particular, analyzer 404 may identify the appropriate number of actions 438 that need to be taken based
on the classification of event 408 and in some cases, initiate number of actions 438 in response to a determination that number of actions 438 should be initiated.
<BR><BR> In some illustrative examples, analyzer 404 may be configured to reclassify event 408 after classifier 402 has already classified event 408.  For example, in some cases, analyzer 404 may reclassify message 420 that has been classified as normal
unexpected event 434.  In other illustrative examples, analyzer 404 may determine that a certain classification for event 408 is inappropriate and may request that classifier 402 reclassify event 408.
<BR><BR> As depicted, classifier 402 and analyzer 404, when implemented in software, may be implemented as separate processes, within a same process, or part of one or more other processes running in agent 318 in FIG. 3.  For example, classifier 402 and
analyzer 404 may be implemented in cyber security process 333 as shown in agent 318 in FIG. 3.
<BR><BR> In this manner, when agents 218 are implemented in a manner similar to agent 400, classification of physical events and cyber-events that occur within electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200 may occur in a distributed manner across electrical <B><I>power</I></B>
grid 202 and communications network 204.  Further, this type of classification determination of response actions for events using agents 218 distributed across electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202 may allow events to be classified and handled more quickly as
compared to performing these operations in a centralized system within electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202.  Additionally, when an agent in agents 218, such as agent 400, is unable to perform the classification of an event or determine response actions for the
event, an agent neighboring agent 400 may be able to perform these operations.
<BR><BR> The illustration of agent 400 in FIG. 4 is not meant to imply physical or architectural limitations to the manner in which different illustrative embodiments may be implemented.  Other components in addition to and/or in place of the ones
illustrated may be used.  Some components may be unnecessary in some illustrative embodiments.  Also, the blocks are presented to illustrate some functional components.  One or more of these blocks may be combined and/or divided into different blocks
when implemented in different illustrative embodiments.
<BR><BR> For example, in some cases, classifier 402 may be configured to classify event 408 as a particular type of event that is different from the different classifications for event 408 depicted in FIG. 4.  Further, in some illustrative examples,
classifier 402 and analyzer 404 may be part of the same process.
<BR><BR> In other illustrative examples, different classifications may be used for event 408.  For example, event 408 may be classified only as to whether event 408 is expected or unexpected.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 5, an illustration of an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  In this illustrative example, electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 500 is an example of one implementation for
electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200 in FIG. 2.  Electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 500 includes electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 502.  Electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 502 is an example of one implementation for electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 202 in FIG. 2.
<BR><BR> In this illustrative example, electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 502 has boundary 504.  Boundary 504 separates portion 506 of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 502 from portion 508 of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 502.  Further, boundary 504 prevents coordinated <B><I>power</I></B>
management of portion 506 and portion 508.  For example, boundary 504 may be a geographical boundary, an organizational boundary, an administrative boundary, or some other suitable type of boundary.
<BR><BR> As one illustrative example, portion 506 of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 502 may be managed by operations center 507, while portion 508 of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 502 may be managed by operations center 510.  Operations center 507 and operations center
510 may not be able to coordinate <B><I>power</I></B> management for electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 502 in this example.
<BR><BR> As depicted, operations center 507 may include data processing system 509 operated by operator 511.  Operations center 510 may include data processing system 513 operated by operator 515.  In this illustrative example, electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 502
includes generator 512 and load 514.  Generator 512 is an example of one implementation for a source in number of sources 206 in FIG. 2.  Load 514 is an example of one implementation for a load in number of loads 208.  Load 514 may be a home, a factory,
a business, an appliance, or some other suitable type of load.  Electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 502 is configured to deliver <B><I>power</I></B> supplied by generator 512 to load 514.
<BR><BR> Electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 502 also includes nodes 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, and 526 along with <B><I>power</I></B> lines 528, 530, 532, 534, 536, 538, 540, 542, 544, and 545.  Nodes 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, and 526 include control devices 517, 519, 521, 523, 525,
and 527.  These control devices are cooperative flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) devices in this illustrative example.  However, in other illustrative examples, these control devices may be <B><I>power</I></B> semiconductor devices or other
suitable types of devices.
<BR><BR> Further, node 516 includes line sensor 529 located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 530 and line sensor 531 located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 532.  Node 518 includes line sensor 533 located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 534 and line sensor 535 located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 538.  Node 520 includes
line sensor 572 located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 536 and line sensor 537 located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 540.  Node 522 includes line sensor 539 located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 542.  Node 524 includes line sensor 541 located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 544.
<BR><BR> In this illustrative example, nodes 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, and 526 are connected to data processing systems 546, 548, 550, 552, 554, and 556, respectively.  Agents 558, 560, 562, 564, 566, and 568 run on data processing systems 546, 548, 550,
552, 554, and 556, respectively.  These agents control the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> through nodes 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, and 526.  In particular, the agents use a number of policies to control the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> through the nodes.
<BR><BR> Agents 558, 560, 562, 564, 566, and 568 may communicate autonomously with each other using communications links, such as communications links 223 in FIG. 2.  These communications links are <B><I>power</I></B> lines 528, 530, 532, 534, 536, 538, 540, 542, 544,
and 545 in this illustrative example.  In particular, these communications links take the form of broadband over <B><I>power</I></B> lines.  Agents 558, 560, 562, 564, 566, and 568 communicate with each other to form virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 570.
<BR><BR> Virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 570 includes <B><I>power</I></B> flow circuit 571 and <B><I>power</I></B> control circuit 573.  <B><I>Power</I></B> flow circuit 571 includes generator 512, node 516, node 518, node 524, node 526, load 514, and <B><I>power</I></B> lines 528, 530, 532, 538, 542, and 544.  <B><I>Power</I></B>
lines 528, 530, 532, 538, 542, and 544 connect generator 512, node 516, node 518, node 524, node 526, and load 514.  <B><I>Power</I></B> flow circuit 571 in virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 570 is configured to deliver electrical <B><I>power</I></B> from generator 512 to load 514.
<BR><BR> <B><I>Power</I></B> control circuit 573 in virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 570 includes agents 558, 560, 564, and 568 associated with nodes 516, 518, 524, and 526, respectively.  <B><I>Power</I></B> control circuit 573 monitors and controls the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> from
generator 512 through nodes 516, 518, 524, and 526, and to load 514.
<BR><BR> In this illustrative example, agent 558 and agent 568 are configured to perform a greater number of operations than agents 560, 562, 564, and 566.  For example, agent 558 and agent 568 may be intelligent <B><I>power</I></B> gateway agents, such as intelligent
<B><I>power</I></B> gateway agent 320 in FIG. 3.
<BR><BR> In this depicted example, agent 558 and agent 568 may exchange information with operations center 507 and operations center 510, respectively.  This exchange of information allows operator 511 at operations center 507 and operator 515 at
operations center 510 to manage portion 506 and portion 508, respectively, of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 502 using agent 558 and agent 568, respectively.
<BR><BR> Further, virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 570 includes components from both portion 506 and portion 508 of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 502.  Different agents within <B><I>power</I></B> control circuit 573 in virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 570 are selected to exchange information
across boundary 504.
<BR><BR> For example, agent 560 and agent 564 are selected to exchange information across boundary 504.  Agent 562 and agent 566 are selected to exchange information across boundary 504.  In these illustrative examples, these agents exchange information
to create and/or update a distributed database, such as distributed database 341 in FIG. 3.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 6, an illustration of an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  In this illustrative example, electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 600 is an example of one implementation of
electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200 in FIG. 2.  Electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 600 includes electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 602.
<BR><BR> In this illustrative example, electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 602 includes generator 604, generator 605, generator 606, load 608, load 610, node 612, node 614, node 616, node 618, <B><I>power</I></B> line 620, <B><I>power</I></B> line 622, <B><I>power</I></B> line 624, <B><I>power</I></B> line 626, <B><I>power</I></B> line
628, <B><I>power</I></B> line 630, <B><I>power</I></B> line 632, <B><I>power</I></B> line 634, and <B><I>power</I></B> line 635.
<BR><BR> Nodes 612, 614, 616, and 618 include control devices 613, 615, 617, and 619, respectively.  These control devices are cooperative flexible alternating current transmission devices in this example.  Further, node 612 includes line sensor 621
located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 624 and line sensor 623 located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 626.  Node 614 includes line sensor 625 located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 628.  Node 616 includes line sensor 627 located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 630.  Node 618 includes line sensor 629 located on <B><I>power</I></B> line
632 and <B><I>power</I></B> line 634.
<BR><BR> As depicted in this example, nodes 612, 614, 616, and 618 are connected to data processing systems 636, 638, 640, and 642.  Agents 644, 646, 648 and 650 run on data processing systems 636, 638, 640, and 642, respectively.  Agents 644, 646, 648
and 650 are associated with nodes 612, 614, 616, and 618, respectively.  These agents control the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> through the nodes.
<BR><BR> Further, agents 644, 646, 648 and 650 communicate autonomously with each other using communications network 652.  Communications network 652 is an example of one implementation for communications network 204 in FIG. 2.  Communications network
652 provides communications through wireless communications links in this illustrative example.
<BR><BR> Generators 604, 605, and 606 may also use communications network 652 to communicate with agents 644, 646, 648 and/or 650.  Line sensors 621, 623, 625, 627, and 629 use communications network 652 to exchange information with agents 644, 646, 648
and 650.
<BR><BR> A number of virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuits may be formed in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 602 to provide <B><I>power</I></B> supplied by at least one of generators 604, 605, and 606 to at least one of load 608 and load 610.  For example, first virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 660 may
include generator 605, load 608, load 610, node 612, node 614, node 618, <B><I>power</I></B> line 622, <B><I>power</I></B> line 624, <B><I>power</I></B> line 628, <B><I>power</I></B> line 632, and <B><I>power</I></B> line 634.  Agents 644, 646, and 650 configure nodes 612, 614, and 618 to be in first virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit
660.
<BR><BR> Second virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 662 may include generator 604, load 608, load 610, node 612, node 616, node 618, <B><I>power</I></B> line 620, <B><I>power</I></B> line 626, and <B><I>power</I></B> line 630.  Agents 644, 648, and 650 configure nodes 612, 616, and 618 to be in the virtual
<B><I>power</I></B> circuit 662.
<BR><BR> Third virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 664 may include generator 604, load 608, load 610, node 612, node 616, node 618, <B><I>power</I></B> line 620, <B><I>power</I></B> line 626, and <B><I>power</I></B> line 630.  Agents 644, 648, and 650 configure nodes 612, 616, and 618 to be in third virtual
<B><I>power</I></B> circuit 664.  As depicted, <B><I>power</I></B> line 620, <B><I>power</I></B> line 626, and <B><I>power</I></B> line 630 carry flows of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> for both second virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 662 and third virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 664.
<BR><BR> The flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> is different in second virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 662 and in third virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 664.  A first portion of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> flowing in <B><I>power</I></B> lines 620, 626, and 630 is for second virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 662.  A
second portion of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> flowing in <B><I>power</I></B> lines 620, 626, and 630 is for third virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 664.  However, these portions of electrical <B><I>power in power</I></B> lines 620, 626, and 630 for each of these virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuits are
indistinguishable in <B><I>power</I></B> flow plane 102 in FIG. 1.
<BR><BR> Agents 644, 648, and 650 in second virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 662 and in third virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 664 are able to distinguish between these flows of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> through <B><I>power</I></B> lines 620, 626, and 630.  Further, agents 644, 648, and 650 track,
monitor, and control these multiple flows of electrical <B><I>power</I></B>.  In this manner, virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuits may be used to load balance the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> through electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 602.
<BR><BR> The illustrations of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 500 in FIG. 5 and electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 600 in FIG. 6 are not meant to imply physical or architectural limitations to the manner in which different illustrative embodiments may be
implemented.  For example, in some illustrative embodiments, communications network 652 may provide communications through the <B><I>power</I></B> lines in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid 502.  In other words, information may be exchanged using these <B><I>power</I></B> lines rather than
wireless communications links.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 7, an illustration of a control node is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  In this illustrative example, control node 700 is an example of one implementation of a node in nodes 212 in FIG. 2. 
Further, control node 700 is an example of one implementation for node 302 in FIG. 3.
<BR><BR> As depicted in this example, <B><I>power</I></B> line 701 and <B><I>power</I></B> line 703 are connected at control node 700.  Control node 700 includes line sensor 702, line sensor 704, control device 706, control device 708, switch 710, and processor unit 712 in this
illustrative example.  Agent 713 runs on processor unit 712.
<BR><BR> Line sensor 702 and control device 706 are located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 701.  Line sensor 704 and control device 708 are located on <B><I>power</I></B> line 703.  Control device 706 and control device 708 are cooperative flexible alternating current transmission
system (FACTS) devices in this illustrative example.
<BR><BR> Line sensor 702 and line sensor 704 are configured to sense a number of parameters for <B><I>power</I></B> line 701 and <B><I>power</I></B> line 703, respectively.  These parameters may include, for example, without limitation, electrical <B><I>power</I></B> capacity, temperature,
current flow, <B><I>power</I></B> phase, line tension, a location of the <B><I>power</I></B> lines, and other suitable parameters for the <B><I>power</I></B> lines.  In these examples, line sensor 702 and line sensor 704 are configured to store information for the number of parameters.
<BR><BR> In this illustrative example, switch 710 allows line sensor 702, line sensor 704, control device 706, control device 708, and agent 713 running on processor unit 712 to communicate with each other within control node 700.  For example, line
sensor 702 and line sensor 704 are configured to send the information for the number of parameters for <B><I>power</I></B> line 701 and <B><I>power</I></B> line 703, respectively, to processor unit 712 through switch 710.
<BR><BR> In this illustrative example, agent 713 running on processor unit 712 receives the information for the number of parameters sent from line sensor 702 and line sensor 704 through switch 710.  Agent 713 sends commands to control device 706 and/or
control device 708 based on the information received.
<BR><BR> In these illustrative examples, agent 713 may make determinations about whether the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> through <B><I>power</I></B> line 701 and/or <B><I>power</I></B> line 703 is within a desired threshold.  Based on these determinations, agent 713 may send commands
to control device 706 and/or control device 708 to control the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> through control node 700.
<BR><BR> In this illustrative example, agent 713 running on processor unit 712 may exchange information with other agents associated with other control nodes.  Exchanging information includes at least one of sending and receiving information.  For
example, agent 713 may send information to agent 715 running on processor unit 714 and/or agent 717 running on processor unit 716.  Processor unit 714 and processor unit 716 are each associated with a different control node.
<BR><BR> In this depicted example, the information exchanged between agent 713, agent 715, and/or agent 717 may be stored in a distributed database, such as distributed database 341 in FIG. 3.
<BR><BR> In other illustrative examples, processor unit 712 may not be in control node 700.  For example, processor unit 712 may be implemented in a data processing system connected to control node 700.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 8, an illustration of an agent is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  In this illustrative example, agent 800 is an example of one implementation for an agent in agents 218 in FIG. 2 and/or agent
318 in FIG. 3.  Further, agent 800 may be part of a virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit, such as virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit 222 in FIG. 2.
<BR><BR> Agent 800 includes <B><I>power</I></B> control plane interface 802, <B><I>power</I></B> management plane interface 804, and <B><I>power</I></B> flow plane interface 806.  These interfaces may be, for example, Ethernet interfaces.  <B><I>Power</I></B> control plane interface 802 allows communications
between agent 800 and other agents in an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  <B><I>Power</I></B> management plane interface 804 allows communications between agent 800 and an operations center.  <B><I>Power</I></B> flow plane interface 806 allows communications between agent 800 and the
devices included in a node associated with agent 800.  The devices in the node may include, for example, a number of cooperative flexible alternating current transmission system devices, a number of line sensors, and other suitable devices.
<BR><BR> Agent 800 includes <B><I>power</I></B> flow signaling process 808, advertisement process 810, optimization process 812, stabilization process 814, and demand and response interface process 816.  These processes allow agent 800 to perform operations within
<B><I>power</I></B> control plane 106 in FIG. 1.
<BR><BR> In this illustrative example, <B><I>power</I></B> flow signaling process 808 sends request for capacity 818 to a control device in the node associated with agent 800 using <B><I>power</I></B> flow plane interface 806.  The control device may be, for example, cooperative
flexible alternating current transmission system devices.  The control device sends message 820 to <B><I>power</I></B> flow signaling process 808 to indicate that the request will be granted.
<BR><BR> <B><I>Power</I></B> flow signaling process 808 also sends and/or receives requests for capacity 822 to and/or from other agents.  Further, <B><I>power</I></B> flow signaling process 808 sends and/or receives messages 824 to and/or from other agents indicating that requests
for capacity 822 will be granted.  These agents are associated with nodes that may be, for example, along a path between a <B><I>power</I></B> source and a load.
<BR><BR> Advertisement process 810 receives information 826 from the line sensor.  Advertisement process 810 stores information 826 in a database, such as distributed database 341 in FIG. 3.  Further, advertisement process 810 sends advertisement 828 to
other agents.  Advertisement 828 includes information 826.  The other agents may then store information 826 in substantially similar databases.  Information 826 may include, for example, without limitation, a capacity of a <B><I>power</I></B> line connected to the
node associated with agent 800, bus voltage, <B><I>power</I></B> flow, phase angle, and/or other suitable information.
<BR><BR> In this illustrative example, optimization process 812 receives traffic engineering data 830 from advertisement process 810.  Traffic engineering data 830 includes at least a portion of information 826 in this example, as well as other suitable
information.  For example, traffic engineering data 830 includes the <B><I>power</I></B> flow through and capacity of lines connected to the node associated with agent 800, as well as other suitable information.
<BR><BR> Optimization process 812 also receives virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit path information 832 from the other agents associated with other nodes.  Virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit path information 832 includes information, such as, for example, the <B><I>power</I></B> flow through
and capacity for other nodes and lines not part of the virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit in which agent 800 is included.
<BR><BR> Optimization process 812 uses traffic engineering data 830 and virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit path information 832 to optimize the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> through an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  For example, optimization process 812 may provision the node
associated with agent 800 to be in a virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit.  This virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit is used to load balance <B><I>power</I></B> flow within the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid such that the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> through the <B><I>power</I></B> lines in the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid is not
greater than a capacity for the <B><I>power</I></B> lines.
<BR><BR> Further, this optimization of the flow of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> by optimization process 812 reduces <B><I>power</I></B> loss within the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid, reduces a cost of delivering <B><I>power</I></B> within the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid, and reduces congestion in the
electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  Further, this optimization also protects the control devices from operating outside of safety thresholds and increases <B><I>power</I></B> flow relative to the capacity of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  In these examples, a cost is a financial
cost.
<BR><BR> Optimization process 812 exchanges optimization information 834 with <B><I>power</I></B> flow signaling process 808.  <B><I>Power</I></B> flow signaling process 808 may use optimization information 834 to configure the node associated with agent 800 for optimization of the
virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit.  Further, optimization process 812 also sends optimization information 836 to the other agents in the virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit.  The other agents may then use optimization information 836 to configure the other nodes associated with
the other agents for optimization.
<BR><BR> Optimization information 836 may include, for example, a configuration for a number of virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuits in the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid that uses the capacity of the <B><I>power</I></B> lines in the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid with a desired efficiency.
<BR><BR> Stabilization process 814 receives stability information 838 from the number of devices in the node associated with agent 800.  Stability information 838 may include values for a number of parameters for the number of devices.  For example,
stability information 838 may include voltage data, volt-amperes reactive (VAr) data, and other suitable types of data for the node.
<BR><BR> For example, stability information 838 may indicate the presence of undesired fluctuations in the distribution of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> through the node.  Commands 840 may be sent to a control device in the node to configure the control device to
maintain a substantially desired distribution of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> through the node.
<BR><BR> Further, stabilization process 814 also sends stability information 839 to advertisement process 810.  Advertisement process 810 may store stability information 838 in the database.  Further, advertisement process 810 may send stability
information 839 to the other agents to be stored in the substantially similar databases.
<BR><BR> Demand and response interface process 816 communicates with an operations center, such as operations center 507 and/or operations center 510 in FIG. 5.  This communication is through <B><I>power</I></B> management plane interface 804.  An operator at the
operations center may send request 842 for information to demand and response interface process 816.  This information may be from the number of devices in the node and/or from other devices in other nodes.  Demand and response interface process 816
sends message 844 to indicate that request 842 will be granted.
<BR><BR> Demand and response interface process 816 sends request for capacity 846 to <B><I>power</I></B> flow signaling process 808.  In response to receiving request for capacity 846, <B><I>power</I></B> flow signaling process 808 sends request for capacity 818 to a control device
in the node associated with agent 800 and requests for capacity 822 to other agents.  In particular, requests for capacity 822 are sent to a number of agents along a path between a <B><I>power</I></B> source and a load in the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  This number of
agents may be used to configure the nodes associated with the number of agents to be in a virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit.
<BR><BR> In this depicted example, the node associated with agent 800 and the nodes associated with the number of agents send message 820 and messages 824, respectively, to <B><I>power</I></B> flow signaling process 808.  These messages indicate that request for
capacity 818 and requests for messages 824 will be granted.  In other words, these messages indicate that the nodes are available and have the capacity to be part of the virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit.
<BR><BR> In response to receiving message 820 and messages 824, <B><I>power</I></B> flow signaling process 808 sends message 847 to demand and response interface process 816 indicating that the request for the information will be granted.
<BR><BR> In some illustrative examples, agent 800 takes the form of an intelligent <B><I>power</I></B> gateway agent, such as intelligent <B><I>power</I></B> gateway agent 320 in FIG. 3.  In these examples, demand and response interface process 816 is used to exchange information
with other intelligent <B><I>power</I></B> gateway agents.
<BR><BR> For example, demand and response interface process 816 may send request for <B><I>power</I></B> 850 to another intelligent <B><I>power</I></B> gateway agent through <B><I>power</I></B> control plane interface 802.  Demand and response interface process 816 receives message 852 from this
intelligent <B><I>power</I></B> gateway agent through <B><I>power</I></B> control plane interface 802 acknowledging request for <B><I>power</I></B> 850.
<BR><BR> In this illustrative example, <B><I>power</I></B> flow signaling process 808 also sends information 848 to the operations center using <B><I>power</I></B> management plane interface 804.  Information 848 is for the health and status of the virtual <B><I>power</I></B> circuit.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 9, an illustration of an agent is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  In this illustrative example, agent 900 is an example of one implementation for an agent in agents 218 in FIG. 2 and/or agent
318 in FIG. 3.  As depicted in this example, agent 900 includes <B><I>power</I></B> control plane interface 902, <B><I>power</I></B> management plane interface 904, and <B><I>power</I></B> flow plane interface 906.  These interfaces may be, for example, Ethernet interfaces.
<BR><BR> Agent 900 also includes <B><I>power</I></B> management process 908, cyber security process 910, physical security process 912, and modeling/simulation interface process 914.  These processes allow agent 900 to perform operations in <B><I>power</I></B> management plane 104
in FIG. 1.  Further, these processes, in this illustrative example, may be only a portion of the processes in agent 900.
<BR><BR> <B><I>Power</I></B> management process 908 sends commands and status requests 916 to a number of devices in the node associated with agent 900.  Commands and status requests 916 are for health and status information for the number of devices in the node
associated with agent 900.  The number of devices sends responses 918 to <B><I>power</I></B> management process 908.  Responses 918 include the requested health and status information in these examples.  <B><I>Power</I></B> management process 908 may also receive commands and
status requests 920 from an operations center.  In response to commands and status requests 920, <B><I>power</I></B> management process 908 sends status information and responses 922 to the operations center.
<BR><BR> Cyber security process 910 sends cyber security information 924 to other agents and receives cyber security information 925 from the other agents.  Cyber security information 924 may include logs, alerts, security events, passwords, rules,
thresholds, policies, and/or other suitable types of information.  Further, cyber security process 910 receives commands and status requests 926 from the operations center.  Cyber security process 910 sends cyber security information 928 to the
operations center.  Cyber security information 928 may include logs, alerts, security events, and/or other suitable types of information.
<BR><BR> Physical security process 912 sends commands and status requests 930 to a number of devices in the node associated with agent 900.  Physical security process 912 receives physical security information 932 from the number of devices in the node. 
For example, commands and status requests 930 may be sent to a camera in the node.  The camera may send back video in physical security information 932.
<BR><BR> Further, physical security process 912 receives commands and status requests 934 from the operations center.  Physical security process 912 sends physical security information 936 to the operations center.  Physical security information 936
includes logs, physical security events, alerts, and/or other suitable information.
<BR><BR> In these illustrative examples, cyber security process 910 and/or physical security process 912 may be configured to receive information directly from and/or about the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  For example, physical security process 912 or cyber
security process 910 may receive a notification of an event that has occurred within the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.
<BR><BR> In particular, physical security process 912 may receive a notification of a physical event that has occurred or is occurring within the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  Further, cyber security process 910 may receive a notification of an information
event, such as a message from another agent.
<BR><BR> Cyber security process 910 and physical security process 912 are configured to classify events.  Further, these processes are configured to determine whether one or more actions need to be initiated based on the classifications of these events. 
In some illustrative examples, these processes are configured to initiate the actions needed to respond to these events.
<BR><BR> Modeling/simulation interface process 914 may perform simulations for the node associated with agent 900.  These simulations may be for a distribution of electrical <B><I>power</I></B> in the node.
<BR><BR> Modeling/simulation interface process 914 receives request 938 from the operations center.  Request 938 may be for information generated by running the simulations for the node.  Modeling/simulation interface process 914 sends information 940 to
the operations center.
<BR><BR> In some illustrative examples, the processes in agent 900 and the processes in agent 800 in FIG. 8 may be processes associated with the same node.  For example, agent 800 and agent 900 may both run on a processor unit in a node.
<BR><BR> The processes in agent 900 and the processes in agent 800 in FIG. 8 may exchange information and/or work together to perform operations.  For example, cyber security process 910 in agent 900 may be used with advertisement process 810 in agent
800.
<BR><BR> As a more specific example, advertisement 828 may be sent from advertisement process 810 in agent 800 to other agents only after cyber security information 924 is sent by cyber security process 910 in agent 900 to the other agents.  In this
manner, the other agents may verify the node associated with agent 900 and agent 800.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 10, an illustration of a process for processing information in an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid in the form of a flowchart is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  The process illustrated in FIG. 10 may be
implemented in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200 in FIG. 2.  In particular, this process may be implemented using one or more agents in agents 218 in FIG. 2, agent 318 in FIG. 3, or agent 400 in FIG. 4.
<BR><BR> The process begins by receiving information from a number of agents in the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid (operation 1000).  This information may be received in a number of different forms.  For example, the information may comprise at least one of
sensor data, measurements, a meter reading, a voltage reading, an alert, a message, a request, a command, an image, a video, a notification, control data, and other suitable types of information.
<BR><BR> Next, the process determines whether an event of interest has occurred using the information (operation 1002).  For example, in operation 1002, the process may determine whether a physical event, such as physical event 410 in FIG. 4, or a
cyber-event, such as cyber-event 412 in FIG. 4, has occurred.
<BR><BR> If an event of interest has occurred, the process classifies the event (operation 1004).  The process then determines whether an action is to be initiated based on the classification of the event (operation 1006).  If an action is to be
initiated, the action is identified (operation 1008).  Thereafter, the action is initiated (operation 1010), with the process returning to operation 1000 as described above.
<BR><BR> With reference again to operation 1006, if an action is not to be initiated, the process returns to operation 1000 as described above.  With reference again to operation 1002, if an event of interest has not occurred, the process returns to
operation 1000 as described above.
<BR><BR> Turning now to FIG. 11, an illustration of a flowchart of a process for classifying an event is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  The process illustrated in FIG. 11 may be used to implement operation 1004 in FIG. 10.
<BR><BR> The process begins by receiving an event (operation 1100).  The event may be, for example, the event that was determined as having occurred in operation 1002 in FIG. 10.  The process then generates data for a number of parameters based on the
event (operation 1102).  When the event is a physical event, the parameters may include, for example, without limitation, an amount of <B><I>power,</I></B> a voltage level, a level of current, frequency, and/or other suitable types of parameters.
<BR><BR> The process then determines whether the event is an expected event using at least one of the data for the number of parameters and a set of expected events (operation 1104).  The set of expected events may be one or more events that have been
previously identified as expected events.
<BR><BR> If the event is an expected event, the process determines whether the expected event is a normal event using at least one of the data for the number of parameters and a set of normal events (operation 1106).  The set of normal events may be one
or more events that have been previously identified as normal events.
<BR><BR> As used herein, a "normal event", may be an event in which the values for parameters corresponding to the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid are nominal, within selected limits, or outside of selected limits but within selected time intervals.  These
parameters may include, for example, without limitation, <B><I>power</I></B> level, current, voltage, frequency, <B><I>power</I></B> factor, and/or other suitable types of parameters.  A value for a parameter that is outside of selected limits but within a selected time interval is
a value that that is outside of selected limits for a period of time below a selected threshold.
<BR><BR> An event that is not a normal event is considered an abnormal event.  As used herein, an "abnormal event" may be an event in which the values for parameters corresponding to the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid are not nominal or are outside of selected
limits and outside of selected time intervals.  Further, an abnormal event may be an emergency type of event.  For example, an emergency type of event may be a fault current, a short circuit, a voltage flicker, a voltage drop, an insulation breakdown, a
back-up operation, harmonics distortion, or some other suitable type of emergency type of event.
<BR><BR> If the expected event is a normal event, then the event is classified as a normal expected event (operation 1108), with the process terminating thereafter.  Otherwise, the expected event is classified as an abnormal expected event (operation
1110), with the process also terminating thereafter.
<BR><BR> With reference again to operation 1104, if the event is not an expected event, the process determines whether the unexpected event is a normal event using at least one of the data for the number of parameters and the set of normal events
(operation 1112).  If the unexpected event is a normal event, then the unexpected event is classified as a normal unexpected event (operation 1114), with the process terminating thereafter.  Otherwise, the process classifies the unexpected event as an
abnormal unexpected event (operation 1116), with the process terminating thereafter.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIGS. 12A and 12B, illustrations of a process for classifying a switching event in the form of a flowchart are depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  The process illustrated in FIGS. 12A and 12B may be
implemented in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200 in FIG. 2.  In particular, this process may be implemented in one or more agents in agents 218 in FIG. 2, agent 318 in FIG. 3, or agent 400 in FIG. 4.
<BR><BR> This process may be one illustrative example of how a physical event, such as switching event 414 in FIG. 4, may be classified as either an expected event or an unexpected event within electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200.  Further, the process
illustrated in FIGS. 12A and 12B may be used to implement operation 1104 in FIG. 11.
<BR><BR> The process begins by the agent receiving an identification of the switching event (operation 1200).  In this illustrative example, the switching event is a connection of a load to the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  Of course, in other illustrative
examples, the switching event may be a disconnection of a load from the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid or some other type of switching event.
<BR><BR> The agent then identifies values for a number of parameters for the switching event using the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid (operation 1202).  For example, the agent may communicate with the segment of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid in which the switching
event occurred.  This segment is a portion of the circuitry within the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.
<BR><BR> The agent determines whether the type of connection formed by the switching event is an allowable connection based on the circuitry within the segment in which the connection occurred (operation 1204).  If the type of connection is not an
allowable connection, the process identifies the switching event as an unexpected event (1206), with the process terminating thereafter.
<BR><BR> Otherwise, the agent determines whether the <B><I>power</I></B> consumed by the newly connected load is within allowable limits using <B><I>power</I></B> data obtained from the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid (operation 1208).  The <B><I>power</I></B> data may include, for example, <B><I>power</I></B> readings
from <B><I>power</I></B> meters, smart meters, and/or other suitable devices within and/or near the segment of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid in which the connection occurred.
<BR><BR> If the <B><I>power</I></B> consumed by the newly connected load is not within the allowable limits, the process proceeds to operation 1206 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent determines whether the type of load connected is an allowable load using at
least one of voltage data, current data, and <B><I>power</I></B> factor data from the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid (operation 1210).
<BR><BR> If the type of load is not an allowable load, the process proceeds to operation 1206 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent determines whether a time versus <B><I>power</I></B> consumption ratio is within selected limits (operation 1212).  This
determination may be performed using, for example, without limitation, a selected period of time after the connection was formed and a level of <B><I>power</I></B> consumption by the load during the selected period of time.
<BR><BR> If the time versus <B><I>power</I></B> consumption ratio is not within selected limits, the process proceeds to operation 1206 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent classifies the event as an expected event (operation 1214), with the process terminating
thereafter.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 13, an illustration of a process for classifying a <B><I>power</I></B> event in the form of a flowchart is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  The process illustrated in FIG. 13 may be implemented in electrical
<B><I>power</I></B> environment 200 in FIG. 2.  In particular, this process may be implemented in one or more agents in agents 218 in FIG. 2, agent 318 in FIG. 3, or agent 400 in FIG. 4.
<BR><BR> The process in FIG. 13 may be one illustrative example of how a physical event, such as <B><I>power</I></B> event 416 in FIG. 4, may be classified as either an expected event or an unexpected event within electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200.  The process
illustrated in FIG. 13 may be used to implement operation 1104 in FIG. 11.
<BR><BR> The process begins by the agent receiving an identification of the <B><I>power</I></B> event (operation 1300).  In this illustrative example, the <B><I>power</I></B> event is a change in <B><I>power</I></B> generation within the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  Of course, in other illustrative
examples, the <B><I>power</I></B> event may be a change in <B><I>power</I></B> demand within the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid or some other type of <B><I>power</I></B> event.
<BR><BR> The agent then determines whether the amount by which the <B><I>power</I></B> generation has changed is allowable (operation 1302).  This determination is made using, for example, without limitation, a determination as to whether the change occurs during a
peak season or an off-peak season, weather information, <B><I>power</I></B> data, and/or other suitable types of data.
<BR><BR> If the amount by which the <B><I>power</I></B> generation has changed is not allowable, the agent classifies the <B><I>power</I></B> event as an unexpected event (operation 1304), with the process terminating thereafter.  Otherwise, the agent determines whether the change
in <B><I>power</I></B> generation affects the ability of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid to meet <B><I>power</I></B> demand in an undesired manner (operation 1306).
<BR><BR> If the change in <B><I>power</I></B> generation affects the ability of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid to meet <B><I>power</I></B> demand in an undesired manner, the process proceeds to operation 1304 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent determines whether the <B><I>power</I></B> being
generated matches the <B><I>power</I></B> being delivered to a number of loads within selected tolerances (operation 1308).
<BR><BR> If the <B><I>power</I></B> being generated does not match the <B><I>power</I></B> being delivered to a number of loads within selected tolerances, the process proceeds to operation 1304 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent determines whether the level of <B><I>power</I></B> quality
within the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid after the change in the <B><I>power</I></B> generation is acceptable (operation 1310).  If the level of <B><I>power</I></B> quality is not acceptable, the process proceeds to operation 1304 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent classifies the
<B><I>power</I></B> event as an expected event (operation 1312), with the process terminating thereafter.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 14, an illustration of a process for classifying a device event in the form of a flowchart is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  The process illustrated in FIG. 14 may be implemented in electrical
<B><I>power</I></B> environment 200 in FIG. 2.  In particular, this process may be implemented in one or more agents in agents 218 in FIG. 2, agent 318 in FIG. 3, or agent 400 in FIG. 4.
<BR><BR> The process illustrated in FIG. 14 may be one illustrative example of how a physical event, such as device event 418 in FIG. 4, may be classified as either an expected event or an unexpected event within electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200.  The
process illustrated in FIG. 14 may be used to implement operation 1104 in FIG. 11.
<BR><BR> The process begins by the agent receiving an identification of a device event (operation 1400).  In this illustrative example, the device event is an activation of a protection device.  Of course, in other illustrative examples, the device event
may be a deactivation of a protection device or some other type of device event.  The agent then determines whether a triggering event for the device event can be identified using data from the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid (operation 1402).
<BR><BR> In operation 1402, the agent may use data from the segment of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid in which the device event occurred and known values for parameters for the circuitry in this segment to identify the triggering event.  The triggering event
may be, for example, another physical event that occurred within the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid or a cyber-event.
<BR><BR> If a triggering event for the device cannot be identified, the agent determines whether the triggering event was a directive from a main controller or operations center for the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid (operation 1404).  For example, the agent may
communicate with the main controller or operations center for the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid to make this determination.
<BR><BR> If the triggering event was not a directive from the main controller or operations center for the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid, the agent classifies the device event as an unexpected event (operation 1406), with the process terminating thereafter. 
Otherwise, the agent determines whether the triggering event was classified (operation 1408).
<BR><BR> If the triggering event was not classified, the process proceeds to operation 1406 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent determines whether a number of grounding and/or earth-grounding elements are present at the location of the device event
(operation 1410).  This determination may be made using, for example, voltage data obtained from the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.
<BR><BR> If grounding and/or earth-grounding elements are present at the location of the device event, the process proceeds to operation 1406 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent determines whether the different alternating current sides of the
location at which the protection device used to be connected are synchronized (operation 1412).
<BR><BR> If the different alternating current sides are not synchronized, the process proceeds to operation 1406 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent classifies the device event as expected (operation 1414), with the process terminating thereafter. 
With reference again to operation 1402, if the triggering event can be identified, the process proceeds to operation 1408 as described above.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 15, an illustration of a process for classifying a request in the form of a flowchart is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  The process illustrated in FIG. 15 may be implemented in electrical
<B><I>power</I></B> environment 200 in FIG. 2.  In particular, this process may be implemented in one or more agents in agents 218 in FIG. 2, agent 318 in FIG. 3, or agent 400 in FIG. 4.
<BR><BR> The process illustrated in FIG. 15 may be one illustrative example of how a cyber-event, such as request 424 in FIG. 4, may be classified as either an expected event or an unexpected event within electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200.  The process
illustrated in FIG. 15 may be used to implement operation 1104 in FIG. 11.
<BR><BR> The process begins by the agent receiving a request for information (operation 1500).  The agent determines whether the request is a scheduled request for information using a schedule obtained from a cyber-security process (operation 1502).  If
the request is not a scheduled event, the agent determines whether the request has been received in response to an emergency (operation 1504).  If the request has not been received in response to an emergency, the agent classifies the request as an
unexpected request (operation 1506), with the process terminating thereafter.
<BR><BR> Otherwise, the agent determines whether cyber-security measures have been satisfied using the cyber-security process (operation 1508).  This determination may be made by evaluating the integrity of the request using the cyber-security process.
<BR><BR> If the cyber-security measures have not been satisfied, the process proceeds to operation 1506 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent determines whether the information being requested is obtainable (operation 1510).  In operation 1510, the
agent makes this determination by using the cyber-security process to evaluate the content of the request.  The agent determines whether the information being requested has been recorded or measured.
<BR><BR> If the information being requested is not obtainable, the process proceeds to operation 1506 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent determines whether the information being requested can be sent based on security rules (operation 1512).  For
example, in operation 1512, the agent determines whether sending the information per the request would violate one or more security rules or sharing rules set by the cyber-security process.
<BR><BR> If the information being requested cannot be sent based on security rules, the process proceeds to operation 1506 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent classifies the request as an expected request (operation 1514), with the process
terminating thereafter.  With reference again to operation 1502, if the request is a scheduled event, the process proceeds to operation 1508 as described above.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 16, an illustration of a process for classifying a command is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  The process illustrated in FIG. 16 may be implemented in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200 in FIG.
2.  In particular, this process may be implemented in one or more agents in agents 218 in FIG. 2, agent 318 in FIG. 3, or agent 400 in FIG. 4.
<BR><BR> The process illustrated in FIG. 16 may be one illustrative example of how a cyber-event, such as command 422 in FIG. 4, may be classified as either an expected event or an unexpected event within electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200.  The process
illustrated in FIG. 16 may be used to implement operation 1104 in FIG. 11.
<BR><BR> The process begins by the agent receiving a command requesting that an action be performed (operation 1600).  The agent determines whether the command is a scheduled command using a schedule obtained from a cyber-security process (operation
1602).  If the command is not a scheduled event, the agent determines whether the command has been received in response to an emergency (operation 1604).  If the command has not been received in response to an emergency, the agent classifies the command
as an unexpected request (operation 1606), with the process terminating thereafter.
<BR><BR> Otherwise, the agent determines whether cyber-security measures have been satisfied using the cyber-security process (operation 1608).  This determination may be made by evaluating the integrity of the command using the cyber-security process.
<BR><BR> If the cyber-security measures have not been satisfied, the process proceeds to operation 1606 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent determines whether the action being requested by the command is allowable (operation 1610).  In operation
1610, the agent makes this determination by using the cyber-security process, for example, to evaluate security rules set by the cyber-security process.
<BR><BR> If the action being requested is not allowable, the process proceeds to operation 1606 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent determines whether the command has been received in response to an action that is identifiable using the
cyber-security process (operation 1612).  This determination may be made by using the cyber-security process to evaluate the content of the command.  For example, the agent determines whether the command is the result of an action that can be defined or
measured in some manner.
<BR><BR> If the command has not been received in response to an action that is identifiable, the agent determines whether the command is predictable based on the state of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid (operation 1614).  If the command is not predictable, the
agent determines whether the command is a simulated command (operation 1616).  As used herein, a "simulated command" may be a command that was generated to simulate a real command.  The simulated command may be generated for purposes of testing the
electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.
<BR><BR> If the command is a simulated command, the agent identifies the command as an expected event (operation 1618), with the process terminating thereafter.  Otherwise, the process proceeds to operation 1606 as described above.
<BR><BR> With reference again to operation 1614, if the command is predictable, the process proceeds to operation 1618.  With reference again to operation 1612, if the command has been received in response to an action that is identifiable, the process
proceeds to operation 1618 as described above.  Further, with reference again to operation 1602, if the command is a scheduled command, the process proceeds to operation 1608 as described above.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 17, an illustration of a process for responding to a physical event based on a classification of the event in the form of a flowchart is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  The process illustrated
in FIG. 17 may be used to implement operation 1004 and operation 1006 in FIG. 10.
<BR><BR> The process illustrated in FIG. 17 may be implemented in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200 in FIG. 2.  In particular, this process may be implemented in one or more agents in agents 218 in FIG. 2, agent 318 in FIG. 3, or agent 400 in FIG. 4.  In
particular, the process illustrated in FIG. 17 may be implemented using, for example, without limitation, classifier 402 and/or analyzer 404 in agent 400 in FIG. 4.
<BR><BR> The process begins by the agent determining whether the event is classified as a normal expected event, an abnormal expected event, a normal unexpected event, or an abnormal unexpected event (operation 1700).  If the event is classified as a
normal expected event, the agent determines that no further action is required (operation 1702), with the process terminating thereafter.
<BR><BR> If the event is classified as an abnormal expected event, the agent identifies and performs an action indicated by an electrical standard (operation 1704).  The electrical standard used may be, for example, the National Electrical Code (NEC).
<BR><BR> With reference again to operation 1700, if the event is classified as a normal unexpected event, the agent identifies a number of parameters for the event that are outside of selected limits for the number of parameters (operation 1706). 
Thereafter, the agent monitors the number of parameters for a selected period of time (operation 1708).  For example, in operation 1708, the agent may monitor overall <B><I>power</I></B> consumption, meter readings, and/or other types of data to monitor these
parameters.  The agent then determines whether an inconsistency has been detected (operation 1710).  The inconsistency may be some undesired occurrence within the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.
<BR><BR> If an inconsistency has not been detected, the agent reclassifies the event as an expected event (operation 1712), with the process terminating thereafter.  In these illustrative examples, classifier 402 in agent 400 may receive this
reclassification of the event and begin further reclassification of the event in operation 1106 in FIG. 11.
<BR><BR> With reference again to operation 1710, if an inconsistency is detected, the process determines whether an origin of the event is an authorized event (operation 1714).  The origin of the event may be, for example, a command that resulted in the
event, a message that resulted in the event, a natural physical event, or some other suitable type of origin for the event.  For example, a message may cause an action resulting in the event.  In operation 1714, the agent may use control data received
from a main control agent for the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid, data from an operations center, and/or other suitable data to make the determination.
<BR><BR> If the origin of the event is authorized, the process proceeds to operation 1712 as described above.  Otherwise, the process proceeds to operation 1716 described below.  With reference again to operation 1700, if the event is classified as an
abnormal unexpected event, the agent locates and isolates a portion of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid in which the event has occurred or is occurring (operation 1716).  This portion of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid may be referred to as, for example, an affected
segment of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  Isolating this portion of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid may include stopping a flow of <B><I>power</I></B> into this area.
<BR><BR> The agent then identifies a number of actions to be initiated based on the event (operation 1718).  In operation 1718, the number of actions may include, for example, without limitation, contacting a number of clients, contacting a manager,
generating a number of alerts, dispatching a crew, initiating a cyber-security process, redistributing <B><I>power</I></B> to the affected area if a bypass is allowed, and/or other suitable types of actions.  The agent may then initiate the number of actions
identified (operation 1720), with the process terminating thereafter.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 18, an illustration of a process for responding to a command based on a classification of the command in the form of a flowchart is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  The process illustrated in
FIG. 18 may be used to implement operation 1004 and operation 1006 in FIG. 10.
<BR><BR> The process illustrated in FIG. 18 may be implemented in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200 in FIG. 2.  In particular, this process may be implemented in one or more agents in agents 218 in FIG. 2, agent 318 in FIG. 3, or agent 400 in FIG. 4.  In
particular, the process illustrated in FIG. 18 may be implemented using, for example, without limitation, classifier 402 and/or analyzer 404 in agent 400 in FIG. 4.
<BR><BR> The process begins by the agent determining whether the command is classified as a normal expected event, an abnormal expected event, a normal unexpected event, or an abnormal unexpected event (operation 1800).  If the command is classified as a
normal expected event, the agent initiates the action requested by the command (operation 1802), with the process terminating thereafter.
<BR><BR> If the command is classified as an abnormal expected event, the agent determines whether an origin of the command is authorized (operation 1804).  If the origin of the command is authorized, the agent marks the classification of the command as
an error and reevaluates the command (operation 1806).  In these illustrative examples, the reevaluation of the command may be performed using classifier 402 and/or analyzer 404 in agent 400 in FIG. 4.
<BR><BR> In particular, the command is still considered an expected command but the command is reevaluated to determine whether the command is normal or abnormal.  In operation 1806, the reevaluation may be performed by analyzing the state of the
electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid and determining how the action requested by the command will affect the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.
<BR><BR> The agent then determines whether the command is normal (operation 1808).  If the command is normal, the process proceeds to operation 1802 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent initiates a cyber-security process (operation 1810), with the
process terminating thereafter.  The cyber-security process may be initiated to protect the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.
<BR><BR> With reference again to operation 1804, if the origin of the command is not authorized, the process proceeds to operation 1810.  Further, with reference again to operation 1800, if the command is classified as a normal unexpected event, the
agent determines whether an origin of the command is authorized (operation 1812).
<BR><BR> If the origin of the command is not authorized, the process proceeds to operation 1810.  Otherwise, the agent reevaluates the command (operation 1814).  In particular, the command is still considered a normal command but the command is
reevaluated to determine whether the command is expected or unexpected based on a state of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid and the action being requested by the command.
<BR><BR> The agent then determines whether the command is expected (operation 1816).  If the command is expected, the process proceeds to operation 1802 as described above.  Otherwise, the process proceeds to operation 1804 as described above.
<BR><BR> With reference again to operation 1800, if the command is classified as an abnormal unexpected event, the agent isolates the command (operation 1818).  The agent then identifies a number of actions to be taken based on the origin of the command
and/or the action being requested by the command (operation 1820).  In some illustrative example, performing operation 1810 may be considered one of the actions that may be taken.  The agent then initiates the number of actions identified (operation
1822), with the process terminating thereafter.
<BR><BR> With reference now to FIG. 19, an illustration of a process for responding to a request based on a classification of the request in the form of a flowchart is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  The process illustrated in
FIG. 19 may be used to implement operation 1004 and operation 1006 in FIG. 10.
<BR><BR> The process illustrated in FIG. 19 may be implemented in electrical <B><I>power</I></B> environment 200 in FIG. 2.  In particular, this process may be implemented in one or more agents in agents 218 in FIG. 2, agent 318 in FIG. 3, or agent 400 in FIG. 4.  In
particular, the process illustrated in FIG. 19 may be implemented using, for example, without limitation, classifier 402 and/or analyzer 404 in agent 400 in FIG. 4.
<BR><BR> The process begins by the agent determining whether the request is classified as a normal expected event, an abnormal expected event, a normal unexpected event, or an abnormal unexpected event (operation 1900).  The request may be a request for
information.
<BR><BR> Further, the request may be classified as a normal expected event when the request is a scheduled and/or approved request.  The request may be classified as an abnormal expected event when the request is not a scheduled request but is a type of
request that may be received in an emergency situation.  Further, the request may be classified as a normal unexpected event when the request is not a request during an emergency.  The request may be classified as an abnormal unexpected event when the
request is neither scheduled nor received during an emergency.
<BR><BR> If the request is classified as a normal expected event, the agent proceeds with providing the information being requested (operation 1902), with the process terminating thereafter.  If the request is classified as an abnormal expected event,
the process determines whether any portion of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid is in an emergency state (operation 1904).  This portion may be, for example, one or more segments of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid.  The agent may use, for example, sensor data and/or
other types of data from the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid to make this determination.
<BR><BR> If any portion of the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid is in an emergency state, the process proceeds to operation 1902 as described above.  Otherwise, the agent proceeds to operation 1906 as described below.  With reference again to operation 1900, if the
request is classified as a normal unexpected event, the agent determines whether an origin of the request is authorized (operation 1906).
<BR><BR> If the agent determines that the origin of the request is authorized, the agent determines whether the request was sent in error based on a status of the origin (operation 1908).  In operation 1908, the agent checks the status of the origin. 
For example, the process may use sensor data from a device in the electrical <B><I>power</I></B> grid that sent the request to determine whether the device has been compromised, is functioning within selected limits, or operating in some other manner.
<BR><BR> If the request was not sent in error, the agent reclassifies the request as a normal expected event (operation 1910) and then proceeds to operation 1902 as described above.  With reference again to operation 1908, if the request was sent in
error, the agent abandons the message (operation 1912), with the process terminating thereafter.  In operation 1912 the agent does not provide the information being requested.  In some cases, in operation 1912, the agent sends the request to classifier
402 in agent 400 for reevaluation.
<BR><BR> With reference again to operation 1900, if the request is classified as an abnormal unexpected event, the agent isolates the request and initiates a cyber-security process (operation 1914), with the process terminating thereafter.  With
reference again to operation 1906, if the agent determines that the origin of the request is not authorized, the process proceeds to operation 1914 as described above.
<BR><BR> The flowcharts, process flows, and block diagrams in the different depicted embodiments illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of some possible implementations of apparatus and methods in an illustrative embodiment.  In this
regard, each block in the flowcharts, process flows, or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, function, and/or a portion of an operation or step.  For example, one or more of the blocks may be implemented as program code, in hardware, or a
combination of the program code and hardware.  When implemented in hardware, the hardware may, for example, take the form of integrated circuits that are manufactured or configured to perform one or more operations in the flowcharts or block diagrams.
<BR><BR> In some alternative implementations of an illustrative embodiment, the function or functions noted in the blocks may occur out of the order noted in the figures.  For example, in some cases, two blocks shown in succession may be executed
substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be performed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved.  Also, other blocks may be added in addition to the illustrated blocks in a flowchart or block diagram.
<BR><BR> Turning now to FIG. 20, an illustration of a data processing system in the form of a block diagram is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  In this illustrative example, data processing system 2000 may be used to implement a
data processing system in data processing systems 216 in FIG. 2 and/or processor unit 310 in FIG. 3.
<BR><BR> Further, data processing system 2000 may be used to implement an agent in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.  For example, data processing system 2000 may be used to implement an agent in agents 218 in FIG. 2, agent 318 in FIG. 3,
and/or agent 400 in FIG. 4.  In this illustrative example, data processing system 2000 includes communications framework 2002, which provides communications between processor unit 2004, memory 2006, persistent storage 2008, communications unit 2010,
input/output (I/O) unit 2012, and display 2014.
<BR><BR> Processor unit 2004 serves to execute instructions for software that may be loaded into memory 2006.  Processor unit 2004 may be a number of processors, a multi-processor core, or some other type of processor, depending on the particular
implementation.  A number, as used herein with reference to an item, means one or more items.  Further, processor unit 2004 may be implemented using a number of heterogeneous processor systems in which a main processor is present with secondary
processors on a single chip.  As another illustrative example, processor unit 2004 may be a symmetric multi-processor system containing multiple processors of the same type.
<BR><BR> Memory 2006 and persistent storage 2008 are examples of storage devices 2016.  A storage device is any piece of hardware that is capable of storing information, such as, for example, without limitation, data, program code in functional form,
and/or other suitable information either on a temporary basis and/or a permanent basis.  Storage devices 2016 also may be referred to as computer readable storage devices in these examples.  Memory 2006, in these examples, may be, for example, a random
access memory or any other suitable volatile or non-volatile storage device.  Persistent storage 2008 may take various forms, depending on the particular implementation.
<BR><BR> For example, persistent storage 2008 may contain one or more components or devices.  For example, persistent storage 2008 may be a hard drive, a flash memory, a rewritable optical disk, a rewritable magnetic tape, or some combination of the
above.  The media used by persistent storage 2008 also may be removable.  For example, a removable hard drive may be used for persistent storage 2008.
<BR><BR> Communications unit 2010, in these examples, provides for communications with other data processing systems or devices.  In these examples, communications unit 2010 is a network interface card.  Communications unit 2010 may provide
communications through the use of either or both physical and wireless communications links.
<BR><BR> Input/output unit 2012 allows for input and output of data with other devices that may be connected to data processing system 2000.  For example, input/output unit 2012 may provide a connection for user input through a keyboard, a mouse, and/or
some other suitable input device.  Further, input/output unit 2012 may send output to a printer.  Display 2014 provides a mechanism to display information to a user.
<BR><BR> Instructions for the operating system, applications, and/or programs may be located in storage devices 2016, which are in communication with processor unit 2004 through communications framework 2002.  In these illustrative examples, the
instructions are in a functional form on persistent storage 2008.  These instructions may be loaded into memory 2006 for execution by processor unit 2004.  The processes of the different embodiments may be performed by processor unit 2004 using
computer-implemented instructions, which may be located in a memory, such as memory 2006.
<BR><BR> These instructions are referred to as program code, computer usable program code, or computer readable program code that may be read and executed by a processor in processor unit 2004.  The program code in the different embodiments may be
embodied on different physical or computer readable storage media, such as memory 2006 or persistent storage 2008.
<BR><BR> Program code 2018 is located in a functional form on computer readable media 2020 that is selectively removable and may be loaded onto or transferred to data processing system 2000 for execution by processor unit 2004.  Program code 2018 and
computer readable media 2020 form computer program product 2022 in these examples.  In one example, computer readable media 2020 may be computer readable storage media 2024 or computer readable signal media 2026.
<BR><BR> Computer readable storage media 2024 may include, for example, an optical or magnetic disk that is inserted or placed into a drive or other device that is part of persistent storage 2008 for transfer onto a storage device, such as a hard drive,
that is part of persistent storage 2008.  Computer readable storage media 2024 also may take the form of a persistent storage, such as a hard drive, a thumb drive, or a flash memory, that is connected to data processing system 2000.  In some instances,
computer readable storage media 2024 may not be removable from data processing system 2000.
<BR><BR> In these examples, computer readable storage media 2024 is a physical or tangible storage device used to store program code 2018 rather than a medium that propagates or transmits program code 2018.  Computer readable storage media 2024 is also
referred to as a computer readable tangible storage device or a computer readable physical storage device.  In other words, computer readable storage media 2024 is a media that can be touched by a person.
<BR><BR> Alternatively, program code 2018 may be transferred to data processing system 2000 using computer readable signal media 2026.  Computer readable signal media 2026 may be, for example, a propagated data signal containing program code 2018.  For
example, computer readable signal media 2026 may be an electromagnetic signal, an optical signal, and/or any other suitable type of signal.  These signals may be transmitted over communications links, such as wireless communications links, optical fiber
cable, coaxial cable, a wire, and/or any other suitable type of communications link.  In other words, the communications link and/or the connection may be physical or wireless in the illustrative examples.
<BR><BR> In some illustrative embodiments, program code 2018 may be downloaded over a network to persistent storage 2008 from another device or data processing system through computer readable signal media 2026 for use within data processing system 2000. For instance, program code stored in a computer readable storage medium in a server data processing system may be downloaded over a network from the server to data processing system 2000.  The data processing system providing program code 2018 may be a
server computer, a client computer, or some other device capable of storing and transmitting program code 2018.
<BR><BR> The different components illustrated for the data processing system 2000 are not meant to provide architectural limitations to the manner in which different embodiments may be implemented.  The different illustrative embodiments may be
implemented in a data processing system including components in addition to or in place of those illustrated for data processing system 2000.  Other components shown in FIG. 20 can be varied from the illustrative examples shown.  The different
embodiments may be implemented using any hardware device or system capable of running program code.  As one example, the data processing system may include organic components integrated with inorganic components and/or may be comprised entirely of
organic components excluding a human being.  For example, a storage device may be comprised of an organic semiconductor.
<BR><BR> In another illustrative example, processor unit 2004 may take the form of a hardware unit that has circuits that are manufactured or configured for a particular use.  This type of hardware may perform operations without needing program code to
be loaded into a memory from a storage device to be configured to perform the operations.
<BR><BR> For example, when processor unit 2004 takes the form of a hardware unit, processor unit 2004 may be a circuit system, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a programmable logic device, or some other suitable type of hardware
configured to perform a number of operations.  With a programmable logic device, the device is configured to perform the number of operations.  The device may be reconfigured at a later time or may be permanently configured to perform the number of
operations.  Examples of programmable logic devices include, for example, a programmable logic array, a field programmable logic array, a field programmable gate array, and other suitable hardware devices.  With this type of implementation, program code
2018 may be omitted, because the processes for the different embodiments are implemented in a hardware unit.
<BR><BR> In still another illustrative example, processor unit 2004 may be implemented using a combination of processors found in computers and hardware units.  Processor unit 2004 may have a number of hardware units and a number of processors that are
configured to run program code 2018.  With this depicted example, some of the processes may be implemented in the number of hardware units, while other processes may be implemented in the number of processors.
<BR><BR> In another example, a bus system may be used to implement communications framework 2002 and may be comprised of one or more buses, such as a system bus or an input/output bus.  Of course, the bus system may be implemented using any suitable type
of architecture that provides for a transfer of data between different components or devices attached to the bus system.
<BR><BR> Additionally, a communications unit may include a number of devices that transmit data, receive data, or transmit and receive data.  A communications unit may be, for example, a modem or a network adapter, two network adapters, or some
combination thereof.  Further, a memory may be, for example, memory 2006 or a cache, such as found in an interface and memory controller hub that may be present in communications framework 2002.
<BR><BR> The description of the different illustrative embodiments has been presented for purposes of illustration and description, and is not intended to be exhaustive or limited to the embodiments in the form disclosed.  Many modifications and
variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.  Further, different illustrative embodiments may provide different features as compared to other desirable embodiments.  The embodiment or embodiments selected are chosen and described in
order to best explain the principles of the embodiments, the practical application, and to enable others of ordinary skill in the art to understand the disclosure for various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use
contemplated.
