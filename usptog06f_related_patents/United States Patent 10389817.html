       <BR><CENTER><b>Abstract</b></CENTER>
       <p> System-on-chip data security appliance ("SoC-DSA") and methods of
     operating the same. In one embodiment, the SoC-DSA includes data security
     mechanisms enclosed within a protected boundary of a single chip. In some
     embodiments, isolation and access control features are hidden within an
     on-chip field-programmable gate array ("FPGA"). The isolation and access
     control features can be implemented such that they are not visible to or
     alterable by software executing on the processing cores of the SoC-DSA,
     which provides for continued data security even in the presence of
     software exploitation, such as a malicious implant, that otherwise
     compromises data security in software-only systems. The SoC-DSA can be
     used to enhance data security in existing data security devices and
     protocols, such as high assurance guards ("HAG") and can be used to
     create new types of security devices, such as devices enforce alternative
     human data interactions ("HDI") models.

<BR><BR>FIELD
<BR><BR> Embodiments of the invention relate to data security.  In particular, embodiments of the invention relate to appliances used in data security systems.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR> Data security involves the protection of data (e.g., through isolation and access control mechanisms) during phases of a data lifecycle that includes generation, transfer, storage, and use.  Some data security systems rely solely on
software-based mechanisms (e.g., generally provided by operating systems) for data isolation and data access control.  As operating system software complexity rises, the likelihood of implementation flaws that can be exploited to compromise data security
(e.g., across the entire system) also rises.  Also, as system connectivity rises, the opportunity for remote exploitation also rises.  As a result, software-based data security mechanisms are increasingly vulnerable to targeted attacks originating from
anywhere in the world.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR> Embodiments of the invention provide an apparatus referred to herein as a system-on-chip data security appliance ("SoC-DSA").  In one embodiment, the SoC-DSA includes data security mechanisms fully enclosed within the protection boundary
afforded by the physical boundary of a single chip.  In some embodiments, isolation and access control features are hidden within an on-chip field-programmable gate array ("FPGA").  The isolation and access control features can be implemented such that
they are not visible to or alterable by software executing on the processing cores of the SoC-DSA, which provides for continued data security even in the presence of software exploitation, such as a malicious implant, that otherwise compromises data
security in software-only systems.  The SoC-DSA can be used to enhance data security in existing data security devices and protocols, such as high assurance guards ("HAGs"), and can be used to create new types of security models, termed trusted human
data interactions ("HDIs") that designate how a human interacts with data to achieve a required level of privacy.
<BR><BR> One embodiment provides a SoC-DSA.  The SoC-DSA includes a single-chip device defining a protected boundary co-incident with a boundary of the single-chip device.  The SoC-DSA also includes a first communication interface, a second communication
interface, and an electronic processor located within the protected boundary.  In addition, the SoC-DSA includes a cryptographic component located within the protected boundary, a data transfer control component located within the protection boundary,
and memory located within the protected boundary storing data.  The electronic processor is configured to perform at least one of encrypting and decrypting data appearing on the first communication interface using the cryptographic component and
subsequently perform, based on data stored in the memory, at least one of dropping, modifying, and transferring the data to the second communication interface using the data transfer control component.

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR> Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description
or illustrated in the accompanying drawings.  The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways.
<BR><BR> Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.  The use of "including," "comprising" or "having" and variations thereof herein is meant to
encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items.  Furthermore, and as described in subsequent paragraphs, the specific configurations illustrated in the drawings are intended to exemplify embodiments of the
invention, it being understood that other alternative configurations are possible.
<BR><BR> A high assurance guard ("HAG") is a computer system component that provides an interface between a sensitive "high-side" network and a less-sensitive "low-side" network, such as the Internet.  A HAG provides a controlled interface that protects
sensitive connections, files, data, and applications from inadvertent disclosure.  Typically, HAGs are implemented as computers that enforce protection at the operating system level by intercepting traffic and placing constraints on information flow
across the network boundary.  For example, FIG. 1 schematically illustrates a network 90 at an industrial facility, such as <B><I>power</I></B> or chemical plant, that includes a HAG.
<BR><BR> As illustrated in FIG. 1, the network 90 includes a demilitarized zone ("DMZ") 101 that provides an information network facing the Internet 100.  The DMZ 101 may include multiple isolated servers.  The network 90 also includes a firewall 102 to
create a protected environment.  The network 90 can also include an <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> ("IDS") 103 that monitors network activities for malicious activity.
<BR><BR> As illustrated in FIG. 1, the network 90 also includes one or more administration and business services 105, human machine interfaces ("HMIs") 106 (e.g., hosted on workstations), supervisory control and data acquisition ("SCADA") controllers
107, or a combination thereof, which, may be within the protected environment (e.g., on an opposite side of the firewall 102 from the DMZ 101).  The SCADA controllers 107 may be connected to critical infrastructure 108.
<BR><BR> The network 90 also includes a HAG 104.  The HAG 104 can include two separate network interface cards ("NICs").  A first NIC 109 can be associated with the "high-side" of the HAG 104 and a second NIC 110 can be associated with the "low-side of
the HAG 104.  In some embodiments, the HAG 104 also includes a third NIC 111 that provides an out-of-band connection to the HAG 104, which can be used for maintenance purposes, such as updating filtering rules applied by the traffic inspection engine 112
included in the HAG 104.  In some embodiments, the HAG 104 implements different filtering rules in each direction (e.g., traffic from the "high-side" interface to the "low-side" interface and vice versa) and can also implement different rules based on a
current level of perceived threat.
<BR><BR> An adversary can gain a persistent point of presence, sometimes termed an advanced persistent threat ("APT"), within the network 90 at the DMZ 101, the IDS 103, the administration and business services 105, and the HMIs 106 using a wide variety
of attack vectors.  Protections at each of these locations (and at the HAG 104) are typically provided by the security functions of the underlying operating systems.  As a result, if an adversary gains kernel-level (or administrator-level) access at any
of these locations, the adversary can hide within the network and carry out malicious activities, including damage to the critical infrastructure 108, data export, denial of service, or remote control export.  One challenge in many networks is to ensure
that regardless of where an adversary gains kernel-level access, the adversary is unable to impact the message transport policy set at the HAG 104.
<BR><BR> A HAG can be implemented using a system-on-chip data security appliance ("SoC-DSA") to address this and other challenges.  A HAG implemented using a SoC-DSA can be referred to herein as a SoC-DSA HAG.  As described in more detail below, a HAG
can be implemented using a SoC-DSA in multiple ways.  Also, unlike a traditional HAG, in some embodiments, multiple SoC-DSA HAGs can be used in a system (e.g., at the network interface to each system or component within the network) (e.g., based on its
cost and form factor).  The filtering rules applied by a SoC-DSA HAG can be updated or applied through an optional out-of-band channel.
<BR><BR> One way of implementing a HAG using a SoC-DSA uses a hardware-enabled transfer method.  FIG. 2 illustrates this implementation according to some embodiments.  In some embodiments, this implementation provides flexibility in updating the rules
associated with a traffic inspection engine of the HAG.  As illustrated in FIG. 2, in this implementation, the SoC-DSA HAG includes a single-chip device 200 that includes one or more electronic processors performing the functionality described herein. 
The electronic processors are located within the physical chip boundary of the single-chip device 200.  In some embodiments, the physical chip boundary of the single-chip device 200 establishes a protected boundary for the SoC-DSA HAG.  Thus, the
protected boundary of the SoC-DSA HAG is co-incident with the physical boundary of the single-chip device 200.  The SoC-DSA HAG can be operated under a battery <B><I>power</I></B> supply, an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> supply, or a combination thereof.
<BR><BR> In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2, the electronic processors include one or more processing cores 207.  Although not illustrated in FIG. 2, the SoC-DSA HAG may also include on-chip memory located within the physical chip boundary of the
single-chip device 200.  The on-chip memory may include random access memory ("RAM"), read-only memory ("ROM"), flash memory, field-programmable gate array ("FPGA") definitions, or a combination thereof.  The on-chip memory may store a general-purpose
operating system executable on the processing cores 207.  In general, the on-chip memory may store data, which may include code (i.e., executable instructions), policy rules, human-data interaction rules, cryptographic keys, hash values, and other
secrets.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the single-chip device 200 also includes a memory interface (not shown) for communicating with one or more external memories.  An external memory may be external to the protected boundary or the SoC-DSA HAG.  In some
embodiments, like the on-chip memory, the external memory may store data, which may include code (i.e., executable instructions), policy rules, human-data interaction rules, cryptographic keys, has values, and other secrets.  Data used by the SoC-DSA HAG
(i.e., the processing cores 207) and stored to an external memory may be encrypted within the protected boundary before being transmitted to the external memory (e.g., for storage in an encrypted form).  Encrypting this data prior to transmission (and
while stored) helps prevent memory attacks.  For example, although not illustrated in FIG. 2, the SoC-DSA HAG may include one or more cryptographic components (e.g., hardware or FPGA-based cryptographic components) located within the protected boundary. 
Similarly, in some embodiments, the processing cores 207 are also configured to perform at least one form of reversible message operation.  For example, the processing cores 207 may be configured to perform message padding and unpadding, message
fragmentation and assembly, message compression and decompression.  The processing cores 207 may perform the reversible message operation on data appearing (i.e., received on) a communication interface (described below) before the data is retransmitted
from within the protected boundary.  Performing the reversible message operation increases attacker workload.
<BR><BR> The processing cores 207 also include a software instance of a network driver with an associated protocol stack for each interface connection of the single-chip device 200 (e.g., one or more Ethernet connections).  For example, as illustrated in
FIG. 2, the single-chip device 200 may include a first communication interface 201 and a second communication interface 202.  Accordingly, the processing cores 207 may include a first network driver 203 associated with the first communication interface
201 and a second network driver 204 associated with the second communication interface 202.  In some embodiments, the first communication interface 201 may be associated with a "low-side" of the single-chip device 200 (and, hence, referred to herein as
the low-side interface 201) and the second communication interface 202 may be associated with a "high-side" of the single-chip device 200 (and, hence, referred to herein as the high-side interface 202).
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the single-chip device 200 also includes additional communication interfaces.  For example, the single-chip device 200 may include a secure out-of-band (i.e., unobservable) interface that may be used to receive updates
(e.g., to data stored in the on-chip memory or an external memory).  The single-chip device 200 may also include one or more communication interfaces for connecting the SoC-DSA HAG to one or more anti-tamper sensors for facilitating hardware monitoring
to help prevent physical tampering of the SoC-DSA HAG.  Similarly, in some embodiments, the single-chip device 200 may include an additional communication interface connected to an input mechanism.  The single-chip device 200 may use data received
through the input mechanism (i.e., user input) to verify the physical presence of an authenticated operator at the SoC-DSA, such as when high-risk operations are being performed (e.g., updating memory, such as RAM, flash, or FPGA definitions) to help
prevent physical tampering.  Also, the single-chip device 200 may include a communication interface for storing and retrieving data, such as public keys, from a remote server.
<BR><BR> Each communication interface may be an interface to a network or a physical interface for connecting to a field device, which may include a sensor, an actuator, or a combination thereof.  A field device may also include an input mechanism for
receiving user input (e.g., a button, a switch, a jumper, or a combination thereof), an output mechanism for providing user output (e.g., a light source such as a light emitting diode, a speaker, a display, or a combination thereof).  For example, a
field device may include an ultrasonic range sensor inserted into an orifice of a container, a potentiometer sensor attached to a mechanical level indicator, a ranging sensor determining a level of material within a container, a flow sensor, a pressure
sensor, a vibration sensor, a temperature sensor, an optical sensor, a medical sensor for a medical device, a switch, a jumper, a valve, a hydraulic piston, a shutoff valve controlling a level within a container, a medical actuator, a sound generator, a
light, or a display.
<BR><BR> When the first communication interface 201, the second communication interface 202, or both interfaces interface with a network, the communication interface may include an 802.11 communication interface, a 802.15 communication interface, a
cellular communication interface, a wired Ethernet communication interface, and a Bluetooth communication interface.  Also, in some embodiments, the first communication interface 201, the second communication interface 202, or both communicates with an
appliance via an intervening network infrastructure, wherein the appliance includes another SoC-DSA or an unbundling application.
<BR><BR> Also, when the SoC-DSA HAG includes more than one communication interface (i.e., includes a plurality of communication interfaces), the processing cores 207 may select one of the plurality of communication interfaces to use based on a property
of the communication channel used by each of the plurality of communication interfaces.  The property may be availability, signal strength, signal-to-noise ratio, interference, a temporal profile, or a historical profile, or a combination thereof.  In
some embodiments, the processing cores 207 selects one of the plurality of communication interfaces manually, automatically, or non-deterministically (e.g., to prevent surveillance).  Similarly, in some embodiments, the SoC-DSA includes a copy of a
communication interface which can be used as an alternative communication path or an alternative attachment point for a field device from within the protected boundary.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, data (e.g., messages) enter the single-chip device 200 through one of the communication interfaces and are deposited into or removed from one or more message buffers 205 stored by the operating system.  The processing cores
207 also includes a traffic inspection engine 206, which, as noted above, is a software process that applies rules, stored within the on-chip memory, to determine if a message should be transferred across the single-chip device 200, be modified, or be
discarded.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the single-chip device 200 also includes a data transfer control logic 208 that provides flow control and sequencing to ensure that a message is discarded, modified, or transferred as instructed by
the traffic inspection engine 206.  The rule set associated with the traffic inspection engine 206 can be updated either through an authenticated secure connection over the high-side interface 202 or through a separate out-of-band connection (not shown
on FIG. 2).  The data transfer control logic 208 may operate (e.g., in accordance with policy or human data interaction rules stored in memory) on data appearing at a communication interface prior to retransmission of the data from within the protected
boundary.  Accordingly, the processing cores 207 are configured to encrypt or decrypt, using the cryptographic components described above, data appearing on a communication interface and subsequently either drop, modify, or transfer the result of
encrypting or decrypting the data to another communication interface using the data transfer control logic 208 and the data stored in memory (e.g., the on-chip memory, an external memory, or the combination thereof).
<BR><BR> Messages (i.e., data) received by the SoC-DSA HAG from an unauthentic SoC-DSA HAG over a communication interface may be ignored to prevent denial of service attacks.  Also, in some embodiments, messages received on a communication interface are
also constrained to have a fixed format and a fixed length to facilitate message checking by the processing cores 207.  The processing cores 207 may also perform hardware monitoring for malicious attacks within the protected boundary.  Furthermore, in
some embodiments, the SoC-DSA HAG includes a secure boot loader located within the protected boundary.  The secure boot loader provides secure software bootstrapping.  Also, in some embodiments, the SoC-DSA HAG dynamically obtains configuration data,
such as software, firmware, FPGA definitions or configurations, keys, hash values, policy rules, human-data interaction rules, and other secrets over a network or data interface.  The configuration data may arrive in encrypted form and be decrypted
within the protected boundary using the cryptographic components described above.  Also, the SoC-DSA HAG may refresh (i.e., reload) its code and configurations from the on-chip memory or an external memory under manual, automatic, or non-deterministic
control to prevent attack persistence.  In addition, the SoC-DSA HAG may non-deterministically diversity data during a refresh by placing data (e.g., data or instructions) at random locations in memory (on-chip or external) to hinder surveillance and
reverse engineering.
<BR><BR> The hardware-enabled transfer method reinforces the security of the operating system using additional control implemented within the data transfer control logic 208 or other processor-specific security mechanisms.  The method uses multiple
layers of software involved in the protocol stack used to receive, process, and inspect messages.  This method is flexible by allowing rules to be updated dynamically.
<BR><BR> Another way to implement a HAG using a SoC-DSA uses a hardware-only transfer method.  FIG. 3 illustrates this type of implementation according to some embodiments.  As illustrated in FIG. 3, in this implementation, the SoC-DSA HAG includes a
single-chip device 300 that includes one or more electronic processors performing the functionality described herein.  The electronic processors are located within the physical chip boundary of the single-chip device 300.  In some embodiments, the
physical chip boundary of the single-chip device 300 establishes a protected boundary for the SoC-DSA HAG.  Thus, the protected boundary of the SoC-DSA HAG is co-incident with the physical boundary of the single-chip device 300.  The SoC-DS HAG can be
operated under a battery <B><I>power</I></B> supply, an electrical <B><I>power</I></B> supply, or a combination thereof.
<BR><BR> In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, the electronic processors include one or more programmable logic blocks 303 (e.g., FPGAs).  The programmable logic blocks 303 may perform similar functionality as the processing cores 207 described above. Similarly, the SoC-DSA HAG illustrated in FIG. 3 may also include on-chip memory located within the physical chip boundary of the single-chip device 300, a memory interface for communicating with one or more external memories, and one or more
cryptographic components (e.g., hardware or FPGA-based cryptographic components) located within the protected boundary as described above with respect to FIG. 2.  As illustrated in FIG. 3, the programmable logic blocks 303 also include a hardware network
driver with an associated protocol stack for each interface connection of the single-chip device 300 (e.g., one or more Ethernet connections).  For example, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the single-chip device 300 may include a first communication interface
301 and a second communication interface 302.  Accordingly, the programmable logic blocks 303 may include a first network driver 304 associated with the first communication interface 301 and a second network driver 305 associated with the second
communication interface 302.  In some embodiments, the single-chip device 300 also includes additional communication interfaces as described above with respect to FIG. 2.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, data (e.g., messages) enter the single-chip device 300 through one of the communication interfaces and are deposited into or removed from one or more message buffers 306.  The programmable logic blocks 303 also include a
traffic inspection engine 307, which, as noted above, is a hardware process that applies rules, stored within the on-chip memory, to determine if a message should be transferred across the single-chip device 300, be modified, or be discarded.  The
traffic inspection engine 307 is encoded in hardware within the programmable logic blocks 303 and applies rules encoded in logic with the programmable logic blocks 303.  Messages are directly gated out onto the other side of the SoC-DSA HAG directly from
the programmable logic blocks 303.  Using this method provides increased packet inspection performance based on hardware acceleration.  In some embodiments, the programmable logic blocks 303 also provide data transfer control logic for controlling the
flow and sequencing of message to ensure that a message is discarded, modified, or transferred as instructed by the traffic inspection engine 307.
<BR><BR> In some applications, the hardware-only transfer method is faster and more secure than the hardware-enabled transfer method.  However, in some applications, the hardware-only transfer method provides less flexibility in updating rule sets
associated with the traffic inspection engine 307 than the hardware-enabled transfer method.  For example, in the hardware-only transfer method all packet inspection and transfer is performed in hardware, such that a software exploit cannot observe or
impact message transport activities.  This configuration frees the processing cores for passive data security activities, such as data transfer profiling and forensics, that do not require direct manipulation of protected data.  For example,
machine-learning techniques can be used to detect (e.g., in the absence of explicit rules) anomalous behavioral attributes of data transfers.  These techniques can be performed locally on the SoC-DSA or in a distributed manner across an independent
command and control network.  The outputs can be used to configure policy determinations, elevate forensics data collection activities, or generate requests and/or alerts for human operator determinations and/or interventions.
<BR><BR> The hardware-only transfer method can be used for unclassified industrial applications where there are no multi-level security concerns, rule sets change infrequently, and changes are primarily in response to corporate threat assessments or
threat assessments designated by a national decision authority.  A fixed set of predetermined rule sets can be encoded in the programmable logic blocks 303, and changes between rule sets can be effected over an out-of-band interface or the "high-side"
interface as described above for the hardware-enabled transfer method.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the hardware-enabled transfer method and the hardware-only transfer method represents extremes for implementing a HAG using a SoC-DSA and, in some applications, the methods represent tradeoffs in ease of implementation,
cost, security, and performance.  However, a multitude of intermediate methods exist in which individual attributes of the design, such as traffic inspection engine; device drivers, message buffering, synchronization and control, and out-of-band channel
handing, are moved from the processing cores into the programmable logic blocks.  The multi-mode transfer method represents any discrete mixture of these attributes.
<BR><BR> New classes of data security devices are also required to address emerging concerns related to data privacy that involve differing models of how humans interact with data to achieve privacy, called human data interaction ("HDI") models.  Source
control of data (e.g. restricting what data is released) and end-use control of data (e.g. trusting a third-party to diligently protect data) are often insufficient methods to manage the overwhelming amount of data available today.  Accordingly, new
systems that enable data producers to efficiently secure data and enforce authorized data use are needed.  These systems must provide mechanisms for expressing data usage policies and for associating data use polices with secured data.  These systems
must also provide mechanisms that allow users to interact with data in a controlled manner even in the presence of compromised software.
<BR><BR> Multiple methods exist for building such systems on the SoC-DSA.  One system could employ a SoC-DSA at a data source and at each user of the data source.  Using this system, data producers could label sections of data with arbitrary markers
(e.g., "personal," "private," "sensitive," "classified," "non-disclosure agreement" or "NDA," "medical record," "identification," etc.) and associate high-level intention (policies) with the data, such as "only friends may view `private` data," "active
non-disclosure agreement required to view `NDA` data," or "secret clearance required to view `classified` data."
<BR><BR> For example, in some embodiments, when the SoC-DSA powers on, it automatically generates a public and private key, a default set of policy rules, and advertises its public key on a public server.  The private key may be held internally within a
programmable logic block (e.g., FPGA logic), which is hidden in hardware.  Any data (e.g., document) that transits the SoC-DSA will be processed according to the applicable data policy to determine if the destination specified for the document is
authorized to access the document.  If the destination is allowed access, the SoC-DSA encrypts the document with the destination's public key within the protected boundary of the SoC-DSA using on-chip encryption hardware (e.g., the cryptographic
components described above).  The document is then wrapped with a fingerprint associated with the SoC-DSA and forwarded by the SoC-DSA.
<BR><BR> At the destination, the inverse operations, based on public key encryption, are applied.  For example, the document is decrypted with the private key of the destination and the data is made available to a consumer.  Accordingly, only authorized
destinations will be able to access high-value, private data and check the fingerprint, which provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation within the protected boundary of the device.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, a data producer can decide whether to allow the use of an unbundling application (which can have attendant insecurities) to decrypt and process documents.  Alternatively, the processing cores on the consuming SoC-DSA can be
configured to execute user code against protected data using privacy-protecting computational techniques approved by the data producer.  For example, a data set can contain medical records containing sensitive patient identification information fields
and private history for each patient, and the SoC-DSA can be configured to fully decrypt the medical record into on-chip memory resources accessible exclusively by the FPGA logic but only share certain classifications of the data (e.g., data labeled
"private" but not data labeled "sensitive") with user code executing on the on-chip cores.  In some embodiments, data security policy may additionally be applied automatically by SoC-DSAs used by data producers or data users.  For example, a dictionary
engine in the FPGA logic could be configured to prevent any data in fields not shared with user code (e.g., marked as "sensitive"), such as patient name, SSN, data of birth, address, and gender, from being disclosed even if such data is present in
otherwise shareable fields.  Techniques such as this would allow groups or corporations to set higher level policies that over-ride personal protection policies specified by the privacy-protected user.
<BR><BR> HDI models can also be implemented by SoC-DSA HAGs to create a system that provides both data transfer (e.g. between networks) security and data access security mechanisms.  Similarly, a distributed system of SoC-DSAs could work collaboratively
to provide data protection at all phases of the data lifecycle.  For example, SoC-DSAs co-located with data generation sources (e.g. sensors and data entry devices) and consumers (e.g. actuators, analytics algorithms, and HDI interfaces) provides
protection at endpoints, and SoC-DSAs at network transitions (e.g. HAGs, firewalls, routers) provide protection in transit.  Transparent encryption processes at the source and destination endpoints create trusted data security storage at all points
between.
<BR><BR> Coordinated attacks on data security systems rely on techniques beyond direct exploitation of protection devices.  Open-source and covert operations can also target people, processes, and organizations.  Innocuous unclassified documents, such as
training manuals, purchase orders, sub-component specifications, subcontracts, logistics and travel documents, when combined through automated document analysis, mass human inspection, pattern-of-life analysis, and social group analysis likely provide a
cohesive picture of sensitive data, which allows collection efforts to be focused.  However, distributed systems of SoC-DSAs can increase the collection workload associated with these methods through fragmentation, communication diversity, zoning,
replication, decoy, vacuous production, and document shaping techniques.
<BR><BR> For example, one way to communicate a document is to encrypt it in its entirety, wrap the document with a fingerprint for storage, and perform the inverse operations at a destination or receiver to gain access to the information.  Fragmentation
methods non-deterministically fragment a document into pieces of random size (which can optionally be packed with random garbage to improve its diversity due to encryption), and the individual pieces can be subjected to the same methodologies at the
SoC-DSA as a complete document.  Accordingly, to collect private data requires that all of the pieces are intercepted, decrypted, trimmed, and assembled, which increases collection workload.
<BR><BR> The availability of alternative communication modalities also allows communication diversity methods to be implemented on the SoC-DSA.  Furthermore, when coupled with fragmentation, communication diversity methods allow fragments of a document
to be communicated using differing modalities.  Accordingly, to collect private data all fragments in all communications are intercepted, decrypted, trimmed, and assembled, which further increases the collection workload.
<BR><BR> Also, although it is possible for a network to store all fragments at a single location, an alternative storage method includes using zoning methods to specify, either at SoC-DSA start-up or dynamically, a variety of alternative storage areas or
zones hosted by different data storage provider services or at unique locations within a network.  Collection workload is again increased because violating the data access security requires collection of data in all zones.  Furthermore, to protect
against storage medium outages, coordinated replication methods can replicate fragments across alternative zones, managing the replication scheme across the SoC-DSAs, so that document re-creation is possible even during isolated network outages,
scheduled maintenance, and other transient concerns.
<BR><BR> Replication and fragmentation can also use decoy methods to inject garbage decoy fragments into data, which is discernible only within the protected boundary of the SoC-DSA.  Again, this increases collection workload by non-deterministically
introducing additional information that must be discerned and filtered.
<BR><BR> One method for discerning the structure of a network or of high-value members within a network includes analyzing the types and frequency of information exchanged between individuals.  This form of analysis yields a graph in which each node is a
person, each arc is a communication, and the degree of incoming edges represents a person's importance within the organization.  This form of analysis can be used to focus collection on particular individuals within an organization.  However, using
vacuous decoy methods across the distributed SoC-DSA system can intentionally cause the resulting graph from this analysis to miss-represent the communication structure across the system, which increases collection workload.  This method can also shape
collection along particular avenues, which can be used to detect collection activities.
<BR><BR> Automated document understanding systems can use a variety of techniques to determine the importance of a private document.  These include, but are not limited to, filtering based on keywords and phrases, word frequency analysis based on the
underlying language, and semantic analysis based on linguistic constructs.  The primary assumption underlying this approach, however, is that the documents being analyzed are well formed in some sense (e.g., they are expressed in some language or some
specific subset of a language, such as military jargon).  Document shaping methods can frustrate collection efforts by injecting random sequences of random words and phrases in important documents or well-formed vacuous important phases in unimportant
documents.  In some applications, these operations can be added transparently across the distributed SoC-DSA system to raise the collection workload.
<BR><BR> Mechanisms can also be used to harden SoC-DSA devices beyond the protections described above.  For example, in some embodiments, on-chip peripheral interfaces can be used to provide tamper protection by interfacing directly to external
anti-tamper sensors.  For example, as noted above, the on-chip memory can allow secure boot and integrity checking to be conducted within the chip-boundary.  Also, in some embodiments, the base of trust in the operating system can be refreshed to prevent
persistence (e.g., by reloading the operating system from a read-only source on a scheduled basis or at the onset of tactical operations).  During a refresh, the binary image of the operating systems code used by the device can be changed each time the
device bootstraps.  This diversified loading process helps eliminates return-oriented programming and helps deny adversaries the opportunity to perform surveillance and reverse engineering.  All of these techniques increase the workload required for an
attacker to compromise a software component within the device (e.g., for the purpose of rendering it inoperable or compromising its core functionality).  It should be understood that applications of the invention may or may not incorporate any or all of
these offerings or other optimizations.
<BR><BR> The SoC-DSA provides data security by guaranteeing isolation and control of data security mechanisms in a manner that prevents observation and tampering from the processing cores.  This functionality is facilitated by implementing isolation and
control within the FPGA logic.  In particular, the SoC-DSA architecture provides hardware to provide for boot-time only configuration of the FPGA logic (e.g., from a trusted (encrypted and signed) image that is stored in a read-only persistent memory
store).  Once the FPGA logic is configured, the FPGA logic configuration is rendered inaccessible from the processing cores using mechanisms controlled exclusively by the FPGA logic.  When processing core modification of data security mechanisms is
allowed, interfaces for any such modification are controlled by the FPGA logic.
<BR><BR> For example, FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a SoC-DSA 390 according to one embodiment.  The SoC-DSA 390 generally includes multiple components collocated on a common die, protected within a common physical boundary 400 of a chip 396.  The SoC-DSA
390 includes one or more dedicated processing cores 401 (e.g., Intel XEON processors or ARM Cortex-A processors) and one or more on-chip random access memory ("RAM") stores 402.  The SoC-DSA 390 can optionally include one or more off-chip RAM stores 418
for unprotected data and/or code or for storing protected data and/or code in encrypted form.  The SoC-DSA 390 also includes a control block 413 for a non-volatile memory store 415 where encrypted application images and data stores can be stored.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the SoC-DSA 390 includes one or more network interface control blocks 412 for network connectivity between the processing cores 401 and one or more network connectivity options 414, including, but not limited, to radio
frequency ("RF") (e.g., 802.11, 802.15.X, ISM band proprietary radios, etc.), wired Ethernet (e.g., gigabit Ethernet), optical (e.g., ATM over fiber), and other communications modalities.
<BR><BR> A region of the SoC-DSA 390 (a region of the die) includes FPGA logic 403.  One or more FPGA-controlled memory interfaces 404, controlled by the FPGA logic 403, provide resources instantiated within the FPGA to the processing cores 401 and
provide for RAM store 402 data transfer and storage between the processing cores 401 and the FPGA logic 403.  An FPGA configuration interface 405, controlled by the FPGA logic 403, allows the FPGA logic 403 to be configured by the processing cores 401
(i.e., if allowed by the FPGA logic 403).
<BR><BR> The SoC-DSA 390 also includes a hardware cryptographic engine 411 and associated protected key stores used for trusted boot processes.  On system start up, on-chip, read-only bootloader code extracts both processing core application images and
FPGA logic configuration bit files from non-volatile memory store 415.  The on-chip boot loader authenticates and decrypts first-stage boot application code into RAM stores 402, 418 and the bit file configuration into the FPGA control plane 408.  The
hardware cryptographic engine 411 is then available to applications running on the SoC-DSA 390.
<BR><BR> The SoC-DSA 390 also includes one or more network interface control blocks 406 for direct network connectivity between network connectivity options 416, including, but not limited to, radio frequency ("RF") (e.g., 802.11, 802.15.X, ISM band
proprietary radios, etc.), wired Ethernet (e.g., gigabit Ethernet), optical (e.g., ATM over fiber), and other communications modalities.  Another network interface control block 407 optionally provides direct network connectivity between a second set of
network connectivity options 417.  The FPGA logic 403 can provide isolation guarantee between the network interface control blocks 406 and 407.
<BR><BR> The FPGA logic 403 also makes the RAM store 409 accessible only by the FPGA logic 403.  Anti-tamper logic 419 and other hardware security mechanisms available in specific embodiments of the SoC-DSA 390 can also provide automated wiping of the
RAM store 409 if a tamper or security event is detected.
<BR><BR> Data transfer control can be implemented using one or more of the network interface control blocks 406, 407 (supporting one or more network interfaces each 416, 417) using a FPGA control plane 408 implemented within the FPGA logic 403.  The FPGA
control plane 408 is isolated from observation and manipulation by the processing cores 401 except where explicitly allowed through FPGA-controlled, application defined logic 410 using FPGA-controlled memory interfaces 404 to the processing cores 401 and
RAM stores 402, 418.
<BR><BR> Data access control can be implemented using one or more of the network interface control blocks 412, 406, 407 with protected data unbundling occurring only within FPGA control plane 408 in the FPGA-controlled, application defined RAM store 409. Access control is then facilitated through FPGA-controlled, application defined logic 410 using FPGA-controlled memory interfaces 404 to the processing cores 401 and RAM stores 402, 418.
<BR><BR> Silicon implementations for the SoC-DSA 390 can include the Xilinx Zynq, Xilinx UltraScale-mpSoC, and Altera HPS product families.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment of the SoC-DSA 390, a full-featured operating system, such as FreeBSD, is executed on the processing cores 401, and one or more network connectivity options 414 are supported by the network interface control block 412.  One
network interface provides the "high-side" network connection and the other network interface provides the "low-side" network connection.  In this embodiment, network traffic is processed by the processing cores 401 and buffered in the RAM store 402 but
is only transferred across the FPGA control plane 408.
<BR><BR> In another embodiment, a full-featured operating system, such as FreeBSD, is executed on the processing cores 401, one or more network connectivity options 414 are supported by the network interface control block 412, and the one or more network
connectivity options 416 are supported by the network interface control block 406.  In this embodiment, network traffic is processed by a combination of the processing cores 401 and the FPGA control plane 408, the FPGA RAM store 409, and the FPGA policy
engine 410, but transfer between the two collections of network connectivity options 414, 416 only occurs across the FPGA control plane 408.
<BR><BR> In another embodiment, one or more network connectivity options 416 are supported by the network interface control block 406 and the one or more network connectivity options 417 are supported by the network interface control block 407.  All data
transfer between isolated network interface control blocks 406, 407, including message inspection and policy enforcement, occurs within the FPGA control plane 408 using the RAM store 409.  In some embodiments, the FPGA control plane 408 discloses
authorized information about data and data transfer activities using FPGA-controlled, application defined logic 410 and using FPGA-controlled memory interfaces 404 to the processing cores 401 and RAM stores 402, 418.  Additional algorithms, such as
behavioral anomaly detection and advanced forensics, can then be performed by the processing cores 401.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the FPGA control plane 408 provides, in addition to basic message transfer between interfaces, first-line policy enforcement primitives including source and destination access control list enforcement and baseline statistics
gathering including source and destination address, port, message size and other attributes available in standard message transport packet formats.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the processing cores 401 run a full-featured operating system, such as FreeBSD, and provide network connectivity using the network interface control block 412 and associated network connectivity options 414.  In this
embodiment, the FPGA control plane 408 can include public-private key generation capabilities that, on system start up, generate and register a public key with a remote registry (e.g., a remote server).  Data access requests may be supported through the
transfer of an authorized, released bundle of data (i.e., encrypted with the SoC-DSA's public key) into memory stores 415, 418, 402.  The FPGA control plane 408 unbundles the data into FPGA RAM store 409 and exports authorized releases of the data via
the FPGA-controlled, application defined logic 410 using FPGA-controlled memory interfaces 404 to the processing cores 401, on-chip RAM store 402, and (if allowed by the security policy) off-chip RAM store 418.
<BR><BR> FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a distributed SoC-DSA network architecture according to one embodiment.  In this embodiment, a plurality of SoC-DSAs 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511 are deployed across the network
infrastructure.  SoC-DSAs associated with one or more data producers 500 and one or more data consumers 511 provide initial encryption and decryption activities at the endpoints.  The SoC-DSAs at a data producer 500 can also specify a data access policy
for the associated data, and the SoC-DSAs at a data consumer 511 can enforce the specified data policy.  Edge-of-network SoC-DSAs 504, 505, 506, 507 provide first-tier firewall mechanisms as well as communication diversity across public networks. 
SoC-DSAs internal to producer networks 501, 502, 503 and consumer networks 508, 509, 510 provide HAG-type functionality as methods for increasing observation workload.
<BR><BR> Fragmentation and diversity methods can be supported by coordination across the producer's SoC-DSA 500 and internal SoC-DSAs 501, 502, 503.  Zoning, replication, decoy, and document shaping methods can also be supported by coordination across
the internal SoC-DSAs 501, 502, 503.  The same techniques can be leveraged within the consumer's network to increase observation workload.  In some embodiments, prior to use, reassembly and injected data disposal occurs at the consumer's internal
dedicated SoC-DSA 511 in coordination with the consumer's internal SoC-DSAs 508, 509, 510.
<BR><BR> The system of SoC-DSAs illustrated in FIG. 5 may communicate over an intermediate network infrastructure that connects the plurality of SoC-DSAs through the communication interface of each of the plurality of SoC-DSAs.  Also, in some
embodiments, as noted above, one or more unbundling applications 512 may communicate with one or more of the plurality of SoC-DSAs through the intermediary network infrastructure.  Also, in some embodiments, at least one of the plurality of SoC-DSAs is
designated as a zone for message operations associated with a subset of the plurality of SoC-DSAs.
