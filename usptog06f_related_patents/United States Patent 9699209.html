       <p> Embodiments of the present technology relate to cyber attack
     vulnerability analyzes. In one embodiment, a method includes determining
     an external infrastructure of an entity, the external infrastructure
     including one or more cyber assets utilized by the entity, collecting
     infrastructure information regarding the one or more cyber assets,
     performing passive cyber security vulnerability testing on the one or
     more cyber assets using the collected infrastructure information,
     assessing cyber security vulnerabilities of the one or more cyber assets,
     calculating an association score for the one or more cyber assets based
     on the assessed cyber security vulnerabilities, and automatically
     recommending, based on the association score, computer network changes to
     reduce the cyber security vulnerabilities.

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR> Various embodiments of the present technology are directed to systems and methods for determining diversity and/or similarity between entities with respect to risk, (e.g., cyber security risk), and the utilization of these metrics in various
ways to improve diversity between the analyzed entities.  In one embodiment, an insurer may desire to understand the diversity of their insured entities with respect to aggregate cyber risk and utilize a measure of diversity to prevent too much
similarity between insured entities, and/or to compare their diversity to their industry peers.  Additionally, reinsurers, rating agencies and/or insurance brokers may also utilize the present technology.  For example, reinsurers may want to compare one
insurer's portfolio to another insurer's to buy, invest, and/or cover.  Brokers may wish to review their portfolio of clients, and ratings agencies may review an insurer's portfolio and use it to provide a rating on the financial strength rating of the
insurer.  To be sure, cyber insurance and other insurance risks can be a function of similarity.  For cyber insurance risk, if insured entities are very similar to one another in a variety of key attributes such as revenue, clientele, industry,
technology utilized such as cloud computing service provider, content delivery network (CDN) provider, operating system, firewall vendor, <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> vendor, security services provider, etc., or other factors, a loss, (e.g., due to a cyber
attack), by one of these insured entities might imply that other insured entities having similar attributes will also experience a loss.  For example, a plurality of web hosting provider may source their servers from the same company.  A cyber attack of
that company's servers may equally affect all of these web hosting providers that use the server, and consequently affect an insured that utilizes one of those web hosting providers to host the insured's website and other web services.
<BR><BR> To be sure, diversity in attributes between entities can decrease the likelihood that a covered loss by any particular entity will also likely affect the other entities.  Thus, the desire is to have the insured entities be as diverse as possible
in the aggregate, to reduce overall risk.  Conversely, similarity of attributes between insured entities can increase risk for the insurer.
<BR><BR> Using the present technology, an end user may determine similar attributes shared between pluralities of entities.  These shared attributes can be aggregated into clusters to locate groups of entities with shared attributes.  In one example,
several entities use the same content delivery network (CDN), the same cloud service provider, a similar website traffic profile, have overlapping executives, and report similar revenue.  While these entities may also share attributes with other
entities, these attributes are used in various embodiments to create a cluster or grouping of entities that, when considered in the aggregate, have a low diversity score due to the similarities in this example.
<BR><BR> End users may use the present technology to learn their aggregate cyber risk compared to industry peers and use that information to, for example, screen potential target entities for inclusion into a group based upon how the potential addition
of their attributes to the group would affect the diversity score for the end user's collection of entities.  In alternative exemplary embodiments, the system may instead of, or in addition to, outputting a diversity or clustering score, may output a
different value analyzing the entities, for example a probable maximum loss (PML) and/or an expected portfolio value.
<BR><BR> The present technology can be used to analyze diversity/similarity between many entities.  The diversity/similarity analyses can use hundreds and even thousands of attributes, looking for diversity or commonality therebetween.  In some
instances, the end user can adjust the attributes and/or select which attributes are important to them and the system will analyze only these attributes when determining diversity, (e.g., a diversity score for aggregate cyber risk).
<BR><BR> While the examples above mention the suitability of the present technology for use with insurance planning, in general, and cyber insurance planning, in particular, the present technology is not so limited.  Other examples of technologies that
can implement the present technology are financial portfolio managers, technology companies that desire infrastructure robustness, human resources, venture capital investment, and so forth.
<BR><BR> These and other advantages of the present technology are provided below with reference to the collective drawings.
<BR><BR> FIG. 1 is a high level schematic diagram of a computing architecture (hereinafter architecture 100) of the present technology.  The architecture 100 comprises a diversity analysis system 105 (hereinafter also referred to as system 105), which in
some embodiments comprises a server or cloud-based computing device configured specifically to perform the diversity analyses described herein.  That is, the system 105 is a particular purpose computing device that is specifically designed and programmed
(e.g., configured or adapted) to perform any of the methods described herein.
<BR><BR> The system 105 can be coupled with end user device 105A, such as computer, tablet, Smartphone, or other similar end user computing device.  End users can interact with the system 105 using their end user device 105A.  The end user device 105A
and system 105 can be coupled using a network 105B.
<BR><BR> A suitable network 105B may include or interface with any one or more of, for instance, a local intranet, a PAN (Personal Area Network), a LAN (Local Area Network), a WAN (Wide Area Network), a MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), a virtual private
network (VPN), a storage area network (SAN), a frame <B><I>relay</I></B> connection, an Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) connection, a synchronous optical network (SONET) connection, a digital T1, T3, E1 or E3 line, Digital Data Service (DDS) connection, DSL
(Digital Subscriber Line) connection, an Ethernet connection, an ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) line, a dial-up port such as a V.90, V.34 or V.34bis analog modem connection, a cable modem, an ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) connection, or an
FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) or CDDI (Copper Distributed Data Interface) connection.  Furthermore, communications may also include links to any of a variety of wireless networks, including WAP (Wireless Application Protocol), GPRS (General
Packet Radio Service), GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) or TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), cellular phone networks, GPS (Global Positioning System), CDPD (cellular digital packet data), RIM
(Research in Motion, Limited) duplex paging network, Bluetooth radio, or an IEEE 802.11-based radio frequency network.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the system 105 comprises a processor 110 and memory 115 for storing instructions.  The memory 115 can include an attribute module 120, a comparator module 125, a clustering module 130, a weighting module 135 and a
recommendation module 140.  As used herein, the terms "module" may also refer to any of an application-specific integrated circuit ("ASIC"), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) that executes one or more software or firmware
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.
<BR><BR> For context, the diversity analyses according to various embodiments of the present technology begin with input for the attribute module 120.  A set of variables that are indicative of attributes of an entity may be input into the attribute
module 120.  In one embodiment, the variables can include technologies a company might employ (e.g., internally and externally for Internet communication such as e-mail, website, and social media online presence) such as CDN provider, cloud service
provider, server type, OS type, visitor traffic knowledge, customer profiles, as well as other non-technical information such as revenue, number of employees, years in business, and so forth.  In various embodiments, the breadth and type of variables
that can be analyzed and correlated are unlimited.  In some embodiments, the breadth and type of variables that can be analyzed and correlated for the company and for their industry peers, for comparison, may be limited by breadth and type of information
that is available at online sources concerning the same.  Again, an end user can define or specify the types of variables that are of interest to them.
<BR><BR> For example, if the end user is an insurer, the insurer may desire to know how diverse their insured entities are with respect to cyber security risk relative to a wide and divergent set of variables.  In regard to a cloud computing provider,
for example, interest in such diversity may be only in technological variables such as traffic, page views, bandwidth, and other variables related to cyber risk.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, entities and end users can access and interact with the system 105 using a variety of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as a dashboard, including various elements as described herein.  The system 105 can use the
dashboard to display messages or notifications as well as diversity scores, similarity scores, and/or recommendations.
<BR><BR> The system may gather variables for an entity by querying the entity for information, scraping available online sources such as websites, corporate filings, news sources, other public record databases and resources.  Additionally, data may be
gathered from the entity's network using devices already present there or by placing a new device on the entity's network to gather more data.  The data collecting device may be a server, router, firewall, switch, or repeater, or may be a software agent
or routine that monitors traffic and/or performs packet inspection.  The data collecting device may be on the company's network and/or its periphery, and may collect and/or analyze the data, while also transmitting it to system 105.  In this manner,
additional, proprietary data may be gleaned from a particular entity's network.  Regardless of how the variables are obtained, the variables are input into the attribute module 120.  The attribute module 120 can format or normalize the input as needed
for consistency.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the comparator module 125 is executed to perform a variable comparison on all or a subset of the variables.  The comparison can be for all or only a subset of all entities.  The subset of variables can be selected by the end
user, as well as the entities analyzed.
<BR><BR> The comparator module 125 is configured to identify variables shared between entities or groups of entities.  The implications of this analysis are multifaceted.  For instance, the same variable can be shared between many entities, which leads
to an inference that a particular variable might be problematic.  This lack of diversity is a more pointed or granular lack of diversity.
<BR><BR> In another example, multiple variables are shared between numerous entities.  This diversity relationship between the entities signifies a more prolific lack of diversity.
<BR><BR> Localized commonality can be found between small groups (even between two) entities.  This type of similarity can be inferred as less problematic than the more prolific examples provided above where similarity exists between numerous entities.
<BR><BR> The comparator module 125 can cooperate with the clustering module 130 to create commonality clusters (e.g., various clusters of commonly shared variables).  In one embodiment, if five entities are being analyzed, many different clusters can be
identified.  By example, if variables A-D are being analyzed with respect to entities 1-5, the comparator module 125 finds commonality between entities 1 and 3 with respect to variables B and C. Also, the comparator module 125 finds commonality between
entities 1-5 with respect to variable A. Other similar correlations can be found.
<BR><BR> The clustering module 130 can display to the end user these commonality clusters, which indicate areas of non-diversity.  Also, these commonality clusters can be utilized by the recommendation module 140 to create action items for the end user
that if enacted would change the diversity score.  Details regarding the diversity score are found in greater detail below.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the comparator module 125 creates a diversity score or index.  This diversity score represents how dissimilar the analyzed group of entities is relative to one another in view of their variables.
<BR><BR> The diversity score can include a percentage of the overall number of compared variables that are dissimilar to those that are shared.  The diversity score can be represented variously as a fraction, a decimal, or a percentage, and may be
included in the graphical user interface (e.g., dashboard.) Additionally, or alternatively, the diversity score may be normalized into a number within a user-defined, or predefined, range, similar to a credit score.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the comparator module 125 can cooperate with the weighting module 135 to applying a weighting to one or more variables.  In one embodiment, the weighting is selected by an end user such as an insurer.  For example, an
insurer determines that industry serviced, gross revenue, and customer country of origin are important variables to analyze, (e.g., for assessing individual and aggregate cyber risk.) For instance, if the insurer knows that gross revenue is very
important to the calculation, the insurer can specify that the gross revenue variable is to be given greater importance in the analysis than other variables.  In another example, the insurer can assign a weight to each variable based upon importance.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the system can determine weightings and variables based on industry knowledge acquired, and use machine learning, big data and other "tools" to make an "educated" determination.  For example, the weighting of variables can
also be determined by the system 105 based on information such as actuarial data, industry practices, or other rules established by end users but which are intended to be applied by default.  The selection of a weighting schema by the system 105 can be
based on variables for the entities.  For example, if the system 105 determines that the entities are all physicians, the system 105 can select weightings that are appropriate for medical practices or hospitals.  Such determinations by the system may be
adjusted and/or otherwise specified by the end user (e.g., using the dashboard) to tailor them for their particular circumstances, preferences, or other factors.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the diversity score can be represented as a diversity graph that illustrates the connection between entities.  Entities can be graphically connected based on commonality of variables between entities.  For example, certain
entities may be connected as being banks that present particularly enticing targets for cyber criminals and thus particular cyber risks.
<BR><BR> In response to calculating a diversity and/or similarity score, the recommendation module 140 can be executed to provide the end user with some type of actionable feedback.  For example, the recommendation module 140 can provide the end user one
or more actions to the end user based on the diversity score and the clusters of similar variables.  These one or more actions potentially increase the diversity score if enacted by the end user.
<BR><BR> In one example, the recommendation module 140 can automatically identify variables, which if changed, would affect the diversity score.  For example, if the entities are or utilize technology company service providers that use a particular CDN,
the recommendation module 140 can output a recommendation that diversification in this area would be beneficial.  The end user can alert the entities and encourage them to explore other options for CDNs.  If the end user is an insurer, for example, the
insurer can encourage this change by offering rate concessions to the insured entities.  Various embodiments of the system thus may automatically provide the diversity score or other information to the end user regarding diversity, which the end user can
utilize to encourage or effect various changes (e.g., via rate concession, screening of potential new entities, adjusting rates based on diversity, or other actions prompted by the system's determinations.) The diversity score might also be used to
inform the insurer as to which polices should be renewed and which polices should not be renewed.  For example, if a potential new (target) entity to add presents an unacceptable cyber risk, based on the diversity analysis, the insurer may choose not to
provide the entity' policy or to provide the policy at a rate commensurate with the risk.
<BR><BR> In another example, the recommendation module 140 can identify problematic common variables that negatively impact diversity scores.  For example, the recommendation module 140 may identify shared infrastructure such as CDNs and cloud service
providers as particularly problematic variables that are commonly shared between several entities.  In some embodiments, the recommendation module 140 can also identify network traffic, network traffic patterns, firewalls, firewall policies that are
commonly shared.  Changing these shared variables would likely increase the diversity score for these entities.  Conversely, the recommendation module 140 can determine key variables that if changed would negatively affect a diversity score.  The
recommendation module 140 can identify these variables to the end user as desirable.
<BR><BR> Actions that could be taken in response to this information could include a project plan that specifies that the insurer is to find new customers that do not share these problematic variables.  Likewise, the project plan could also or
alternatively specify that the insurer is to find new customers that do share key positive variables.
<BR><BR> In one example, an action includes the recommendation module 140 creating and providing the end user with a variable profile of a target entity that when added to the plurality of entities increases the diversity score.  For example, the
recommendation module 140 could create a profile for a prototypical new client that is in a different technology sector or a completely different industry sector.  In another embodiment, the recommendation module 140 could create a profile for a
prototypical new client that includes desirable variables, rather than merely a client that excludes certain disfavored variables.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the recommendation module 140 can provide the end user with a list of entities of the plurality of entities that are lowering the diversity score.  Again, as mentioned above, certain clusters of variables may be found in
common between entities.  Certain ones of these clusters may have more of a negative impact on the diversity score than others.  For example, commonality between headquarters or domicile may have no impact on the diversity score, even if this variable is
shared in common between several entities.  On the other hand, commonality in gross revenue or average employee age may have a drastic impact on the diversity score for one reason or another.  To be sure, commonality of a variable(s) does not always
negatively affect the end user or the end user's business.  In these instances the commonality can be ignored or weighted so as not to affect the calculated diversity score.
<BR><BR> In another example, the recommendation module 140 can provide the end user with a list of entities of the plurality of entities that, if lost would lower the diversity score, which can prompt the end user to take action to avoid.
<BR><BR> In another example, action the recommendation module 140 can compare a variable profile for a new entity to determine if the addition of the new entity to the analysis will negatively or positively impact the diversity score of the group.
<BR><BR> For example, the attribute module 120 can receive a variable profile for a new entity and parse out the variables which are indicative of attributes of the new entity.  This profile could include an application form, a survey, or any other
content that is capable of conveying variables.
<BR><BR> Next, the comparator module 125 adds a set of variables of the new entity to the comparison described above and repeats the calculation of the diversity score.  The recommendation module 140 can alert the end user if the addition of the new
entity decreases the diversity score.  The recommendation module 140 can alert the end user if the addition of the new entity increases the diversity score as well.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the recommendation module 140 updates the diversity score based on feedback received from the end user.  For example, if the end user wants to view how the addition of a proposed new client will affect an existing diversity
score, the profile for the new client is added to the system and the variables for the new client are processed and added to the comparison process.  A new or updated diversity score is calculated and displayed to the end user.
<BR><BR> The difference between the new diversity score and the old diversity score is expressed as a diversity delta.  In some embodiments, the system 105 can apply thresholds to the diversity delta to determine if a proposed change to the entity
grouping is sufficient to warrant the proposed change.  For example, the system 105 may require at least a net change or diversity delta of 20%.  Other percentages can also be utilized.  The present technology provides information related to the updated
information (the new diversity score), including differences (the amount of the change made in one or more updates, namely the delta), and trends (patterns over many time steps).
<BR><BR> The present technology also provides attribution information when a diversity score changes.  In particular, the methods and system indicate to a user why the score has changed, namely what exactly has changed in the underlying data sets to
effect that higher level score change.  In this manner, the systems and methods of the present technology provide detailed information to the user to identify the changed data, and thereby understand the positive and negative impacts of the user's
actions on the diversity score.
<BR><BR> The system 105 can also build an entity portfolio for an end user with knowledge gained from an analysis of variables for a plurality of entities.  For instance, the system 105 can create a report that informs the end user as to how many and
what type of entities a portfolio should have to be balanced in terms of diversity, (e.g., with respect to cyber risk.) For example, the report may indicate that an insurer should have a certain percentage of clients in the banking sector, a certain
percentage in the technology sector, and a certain percentage in the medial industry.  These sectors of the portfolio are deduced by comparing variables for various entities in a given industry that lead to a suitable diversity score.
<BR><BR> It will be understood that the diversity score can be counterbalanced by other factors such as revenue for the end user.  That is, an insurer may be more likely to accept a lower diversity score from a group of entities that pay higher premiums
or a group of entities that is at least partially self-insured.
<BR><BR> FIG. 2 is a flowchart of an example method 200 that is executed by the system (e.g. system 105), in accordance with the present technology.  The method 200 includes the system 105 (for each of a plurality of entities), receiving 205 a set of
variables that are indicative of attributes of an entity.  These variables can include any number or type of variables that represent the attributes of the entity.
<BR><BR> These variables are collected for numerous entities that may belong, in some embodiments, to a particular class or group.  For example, the entities could include all employees in a company, all insured customers of an insurance agency,
investors in a mutual fund, or other groups.
<BR><BR> Next the method 200 includes the system 105 comparing 210 the sets of variables for the plurality of entities to each other, and locating 215 clusters of similar variables shared between two or more of the plurality of entities.
<BR><BR> Next, the method 200 includes the system 105 clustering 220 common variables and identifying the entities that share the common variables.  These clusters are indicative of non-diversity between these entities.
<BR><BR> Next, the method 200 includes the system 105 calculating 225 a diversity score that represents how different the plurality of entities are to one another based on variables that are not shared between the plurality of entities.  This diversity
is directly related to the commonality discovered above.  The more similar or commonly shared variables exist, the less diverse the entities are relative to one another, as a general rule.  Again, as mentioned above, some variables will have little to no
impact on diversity as dictated by weighting or variable selection by the end user.  For example, if a commonly shared variable is not included in the diversity calculation by the end user the variable has no impact on the diversity score.
<BR><BR> Next, the method 200 includes the system 105 receiving 230 feedback from an end user in response to providing the diversity score to the end user.  Also, the method 200 includes the system 105 updating 235 the diversity score in response to the
feedback.
<BR><BR> Various types of feedback are contemplated and illustrated in FIG. 2.  The feedback can take the form of a suggestion, option, report, or other output that is actionable by the end user.  Exemplary methods and systems according to the present
technology may also provide benchmarking over time.  In this manner, an insurance company or other entity tracking aggregate cyber risk may track their diversity score over an adjustable time period, for example days, weeks, months, and/or years.
<BR><BR> It will be understood that the methods illustrated in flowchart form are susceptible to execution in various forms such that not all steps may be required.  In some instances, additional steps can be added.  Some steps may be rephrased or
replaced with other steps, in accordance with the claimed technology.
<BR><BR> In FIG. 3, the flowchart illustrates the method 300 including the system 105 providing 305 the user with one or more actions/suggestions that to the end user based on the diversity score and the clusters of similar variables.  These actions can
potentially increase the diversity score if enacted by the end user.
<BR><BR> In step 310, an action includes providing the end user with a variable profile of a target entity that when added to the plurality of entities increases the diversity score.
<BR><BR> In step 315, an action includes providing the end user with a list of entities of the plurality of entities that are lowering the diversity score.
<BR><BR> In step 320, an action includes providing the end user with a list of entities of the plurality of entities that, if lost, would lower the diversity score.
<BR><BR> Regardless of the action taken (steps 310, 315, and/or 320), the feedback is used in calculating 325 an updated diversity score and delivering 330 the updated diversity score to the end user.
<BR><BR> Again, these options are merely examples and are not intended to be limiting.  These options can be provided individually or in combination, if desired.
<BR><BR> FIG. 4 is a flowchart of a new entity analysis method 400.  In the method 400, the system (e.g. system 105) is utilized to compare the variables of a new entity to an existing diversity analysis.  For example, an insurer desires to determine how
the addition of this new entity will affect the diversity of an existing client base.  This aggregate risk analysis can be used to ensure that diversity is maintained or increased when a new client is added to an existing pool of clients.
<BR><BR> The method 400 includes receiving 405 a variable profile for a new entity.  The variable profile either includes a set of variables or a set of variables is deduced from the variable profile.  As mentioned above, the variable profile can include
an application form, a resume, a corporate filing such as a tax return, or any other document that includes attributes of an entity.
<BR><BR> Next, the method 400 includes adding 410 the set of variables of the new entity to the variables of the previously analyzed entities and performing 415 an updated comparison of variables.  Next, the method 400 includes generating 420 an updated
diversity score calculation.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the method 400 includes alerting 425 the end user if the addition of the new entity decreases (or increases) the diversity score.  The end user can decided to accept or reject this new client based upon how the client
affects the diversity score.
<BR><BR> Advantageously, the present technology can be used in scenarios where diversity of clientele is desirous.  The present technology can perform diversity analyses on potentially thousands of attributes across countless entities in ways that would
be impossible to accomplish absent the use of the diversity analysis system.  The diversity analyses of the present technology can bring clarity to business planning and project management, where integration of new clients/entities may affect the
diversity of a current client base (either positively or negatively).  Where diversification is desirable or required, the present technology provides a means for facilitating and maintaining this diversity in a way that is actionable and usable to the
end user.  That is, the present technology provides a way for end users to mitigate risk through diversification of their customer base or however diversity impacts their particular business or operations.
<BR><BR> Various embodiments of systems and methods are provided for assessing and reducing cyber risks associated with companies or other entities.  In various embodiments, a method comprises assessing risk of a cyber security failure in a computer
network of an entity, using a computer agent configured to collect information from at least publicly accessible Internet elements.  The cyber security failure may include a cyber attack and/or a privacy incident (including but not limited to an incident
involving sensitive information), to name just a few.  The computer agent may be further configured to collect and/or analyze information from the computer network of the entity.
<BR><BR> The exemplary method includes automatically determining, based on the assessed risk, a change or a setting to at least one element of policy criteria of a cyber security policy.  The cyber security policy may be a policy from an insurance
company, a product warranty for first and/or third party costs that an entity purchases from one of a networking, security product, or services provider, to name a few.  In various embodiments, the method includes automatically recommending, based on the
assessed risk, computer network changes to reduce the assessed risk and providing one or more recommended computer network changes to reduce the assessed risk, enactment by the entity of at least one of the one or more of the recommended computer network
changes to reduce the assessed risk to the entity.  In some embodiments, the exemplary method includes determining that the entity has enacted at least a portion of the recommended computer network changes, and in response, and automatically reassessing
the cyber security risk of a cyber security failure in the computer network of the entity based on the enacted recommended computer network changes.  The exemplary method further includes dynamically re-determining, based on the reassessed risk of a
cyber security failure in the computer network of the entity, the change or the setting to the at least one element of policy criteria of the cyber security policy.  In various embodiments, the at least one element of policy criteria of the cyber
security policy is a term and/or a condition.  For example, a term and a condition may include a retention amount, a deductible, a premium, a coverage limit, a future valuation, a term length, and so forth.
<BR><BR> Various embodiments of systems and methods are provided for calibrating cyber risks associated with commercial markets.  In various embodiments, a method comprises assessing the risk of a cyber security failure in a computer network of a
commercial market, using a computer agent configured to collect information from at least publicly accessible Internet elements.  The cyber security failure may include a cyber attack and/or a privacy incident (including but not limited to an incident
involving sensitive information), to name just a few.  The computer agent may be further configured to collect and/or analyze information from the computer network of the commercial market.  In some embodiments, the commercial market is insurance,
corporate credit, small business loans, global equities, derivatives, or futures, to name just a few.  In various embodiments, the policy is a policy from an insurance company, or a warranty, to name a few.  In various embodiments, the method includes
automatically recommending computer network changes to reduce the assessed risk; and automatically reassessing the cyber risk of the computer network of the commercial market based on the recommended computer network changes.  In some embodiments, the
entity is a commercial market for at least one of insurance, corporate credit, small business loans, global equities, derivatives, and futures.  In various embodiments, the method includes calibrating cyber risks associated with the commercial market.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the method includes, based on the assessing of risk of the cyber security failure in the computer network of the entity, plotting one or more features of the entity and other members of a peer group of the entity, the
plotting being configured to visually illustrate the risk of a cyber security failure in the computer network of the entity; and the automatically recommending of computer network changes being based on the plotting.  The plotting may be configured to
visually illustrate the cyber risk of the entity.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the method comprises determining a sophistication score of the entity with respect to cyber risk, which may be considered the quality of the defense with respect to repelling, defeating, or preventing a security failure.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the method also comprises determining a motivation score of a hacker or other actor with respect to initiating one of a cyber security failure.  A composite score may be created from the motivation score and the
sophistication score.
<BR><BR> The exemplary method and system may be used in a cyber policy market, and/or by a cyber policy provider providing policies.  The cyber policy may include a cyber risk assessment/management service, which may provide feedback to one or both of
the policy company and the insured entity, enabling the entity to determine how to reduce their cyber risk, and/or how they are positioned within their peer group and/or within a universe of companies with respect to their cyber risk.  As used herein,
the policy, including but not limited to a cyber policy, may be a policy from an insurance company or it could be a product warranty for first and/or third party costs that an entity purchases from a networking or security product or services provider.
<BR><BR> Additionally, following the recommendations may enable the policy company to update and/or change policy criteria of a cyber security policy.  In still further alternatives, the composite score of several or many entities may be aggregated and
used by insurance companies, reinsurance companies, brokers and/or ratings agencies to understand and/or evaluate an aggregate risk and assess insurance premiums and/or reinsurance treaties and/or change or evaluate a credit rating.  This is described in
further detail above.
<BR><BR> Also, as mentioned above, the composite store can include facets of creditworthiness, small business risk, and other commercial metrics of commercial risk.
<BR><BR> Cyber insurance insures entities against damage and/or loss due to security failures (e.g., a cyber attack, a privacy incident).  Assessing cyber risk can be a difficult task due to the volatility of the cyber environment.  For example, a risk
of a security failure such as a cyber attack lacks actuarial data since there is an active adversary behind cyber attacks, and past cyber attacks do not predict future cyber attacks.  Better analysis of cyber risk, including the risk of security
failures, and providing greater service to insurance companies and insured entities, is desirable
<BR><BR> The technology disclosed herein provides a cyber risk assessment, and provides methods and systems for improving a cyber risk assessment, by, for instance, reducing a risk of a cyber attack, predicting the probability of a cyber attack, and/or
determining the extent to which a cyber attack might cause damage.  Exemplary methods plot the cyber risk within a peer group, which may be defined by industry, revenue, and/or any other appropriate metric.  Various exemplary methods plot the cyber risk
within the universe of companies, (e.g., universe of companies for which such cyber risk has been assessed.  Exemplary methods assess risk in a plot using one feature.  In other examples, multiple features may be plotted into a matrix.)
<BR><BR> For those exemplary matrix embodiments, the assessment of risk is plotted with a two (or more) dimensional analysis, which may be plotted into a two by two matrix or graph, or in any appropriate alternative visualization method, particularly for
greater than two dimensions.  For example, the two dimensions may be characterized as 1) motivation (which may be synonymous or similar to offense, e.g., the motivation of a bad actor to attack an entity) and 2) sophistication (which may be synonymous or
similar to defense, e.g., the sophistication of an entity to prevent and/or repel a cyber attack, or compel more responsible behavior from employees and associates to prevent a privacy event with respect to sensitive information).  Alternative axes for
the two dimensional analysis are also possible, for example, measurements other than motivation and sophistication.  The system may output an estimated (or expected) commercial impact, which may encompass both the risk of a cyber attack, and the
potential amount of damage caused by a cyber attack.
<BR><BR> In addition to analyzing the cyber risk, the present technology may provide enhanced value by quantifying a cyber risk, thereby creating a market for it.  Additionally, the present technology may provide a cyber risk management service tied to a
cyber policy.  A cyber policy (also referred to as a cyber insurance policy) as used herein includes any insurance policy covering any loss arising out of a security failure, including tangible and intangible property.  The policy may cover both first
party and third party losses arising out of any perils including a security failure.  The policy may cover business interruption, loss of income, Director and Officer liability, information asset coverage, and extra expense coverage, or any other insured
loss arising out of a security failure.  A cyber policy as used herein includes security and privacy coverage, including regulatory coverage (e.g., FTC, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)) covering fines and penalties, and
defense costs and damages.  The coverage provided by a cyber policy as used herein may provide for privacy breach coaches, forensic experts, a public relations campaign, cyber extortion, information asset recovery, business interruption (including for
example, lost income, extra expenses, and/or all costs incurred but for the cyber security failure), or any other covered costs or losses.
<BR><BR> Aspects of a cyber policy may be altered based on use of, and implementation of recommendations provided by, the cyber risk management service.  These aspects may include any policy criteria of the policy.  Elements of policy criteria include,
for example, a retention amount, a deductible, a premium, coverage limits, future valuation, term length, or a term or condition of the policy.
<BR><BR> The analysis may be a position on a graph, and may include a scatterplot of the peer group members, and/or a simple ranking amongst the peers.  The analysis may be two (or more dimensional).  Additionally or alternatively, the analysis may be
resolved into a single composite score embodying the analysis.  The plot may be changed to include more or fewer members of the peer group based on further variables of the peer group members, for instance, revenue, etc. The plot may include points for a
universe of companies along with the points for the particular entity.  For a two dimensional analysis example, each axis may be a function of many sub-variables, discussed herein as examples of motivation and sophistication.  The sub-variables may be
weighted equally, or differently, and the weighting may be static, dynamic, or customizable based on different analysis goals.  Examples of motivation and sophistication elements will be described in greater detail below.
<BR><BR> The exemplary assessment system may provide recommendations to an entity to improve their cyber risk assessment, by, for instance, reducing their cyber risk.  This may be accomplished by various methods, including increasing the sophistication
of the organization or entity, or decreasing the motivation of the attacker to go after this organization or entity.  The recommendations may be specific and may impact one or both of the axes of the two dimensional risk analysis.  Implementing the
recommendations, which may be accomplished in some embodiments automatically, may reduce the risk of a cyber security failure.
<BR><BR> Implementing the recommendations may impact an entity's relative position in their peer group, in a universe of companies, as well as any expected commercial impact of a security failure (e.g., a cyber attack, a privacy incident).  Additionally,
factors beyond the control of the company or entity, for instance, actions by the other peer group members, activity in the hacker community or vulnerabilities in software and/or hardware, may also impact both a relative risk analysis (e.g., impacting
the company or entity's position in their peer group) and/or an absolute expected commercial loss.  This change over time may be accessible and/or charted for trending information, which may be useful for planning and/or changing policy criteria
(including the premium) for the policy.  An entity may make a judgment of which recommendations to prioritize in implementation based on the different recommendations provided by the system to other members of their peer group.  Examples of
recommendations are illustrated in FIG. 12.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the recommendations generated for an entity can be changed in comparison with other entities in a group.  Thus, the system 505 can provide a first set of recommendations based solely on the motivation and/or sophistication
(e.g., cyber risk) analysis for the entity.
<BR><BR> In another example, the system 505 can generate a second set of recommendations based on a comparison of the cyber risk for the entity to the aggregate risk score for many entities.  This second set of recommendations includes additional
recommendations for the entity which are determined to improve the cyber risk of the entity.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the system 505 can determine risk factors that are discrepant between the entity and another entity (or an aggregate group of entities) and highlight these recommendations as being unique for the entity.  For example, if the
entity is the only one out of a group of their peer entities that does not use a CDN (content delivery network), the system 505 can highlight this difference.  These unique discrepancies can illustrate areas where the entity is particularly or uniquely
vulnerable.
<BR><BR> Stated otherwise, the system 505 identifies clusters of sophistication elements or motivation elements that are shared between two or more of the portfolio of entities.  The clusters of sophistication elements or motivation elements being
associated with an increase in cyber risk.  The recommendations generated by the system 505 for an entity of the portfolio of entities will cause a decrease in the cyber risk if implemented.
<BR><BR> In various embodiments, where scores are tracked over time, the system 505 can also be configured to periodically reassess the cyber risk of an entity.  In some embodiments, the reassessment occurs after the entity has implemented one or more of
the recommendations.
<BR><BR> It may be advantageous for the entity to understand not only that a particular score was changed, but also what affected the change in score.  Thus, the system 505 is configured to provide attribution for a score change, including verifiable
data including time and attribution information.  This attribution identifies/represents the underlying data set which affected the score change, and shows why, how much, and how the score changes.
<BR><BR> By way of example, the entity, unbeknownst to them, has a dramatic increase in pageviews on their website.  This increase in pageviews causes an increase in the motivation score for the entity.  That is, the increase in pageviews indicates that
a hacker might be more motivated to hack the entity's webpage because of its high traffic profile.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the system 505 can be used to automatically institute changes on behalf of the entity that will decrease the likelihood that the entity will experience or be adversely affected by a security failure such as a cyber attack. 
These automatic changes occur based on the recommendations generated for the entity.
<BR><BR> In one example, the system 505 can establish new content hosts for the content of the entity.  The system 505 can inform the entity that diversity in content hosting can decrease the likelihood that all of the entity's content or user
information will be exposed, as compared to if the content is stored in one centralized location.  To be sure, the system 505 can be used to automatically change technical aspects of the entity, such as computing diversity, content distribution and
delivery, and other technical attributes.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the system 505 comprises a commercial estimator module 550 that is configured to estimate a commercial impact to the entity for a simulated security failure (e.g., a cyber attack, a privacy incident).  Thus, the system 505
can execute theoretical or simulated security failures against a cyber profile of an entity.  In one example, the cyber profile for an entity is determined from the various sophistication and motivation elements determined for the entity.  The commercial
estimator module 550 then calculates the effect of, for example, a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) on the entity.  To be sure, the simulated cyber attack in this example tests the sophistication of the entity and is affected by the motivation
regarding the entity.  The economic impact can include an economic impact to the entity itself, other entities that depend upon the entity, or combinations thereof.  For example, a cyber security failure for a commercial institution, such as a DDoS
attack, can cause direct economic impact on the institution from website downtime.  The cyber security failure can also cause a commercial impact to the customers of the commercial institution if social security numbers, account numbers, or other
sensitive consumer and/or personal information is stolen.
<BR><BR> Additionally, implementing the recommendations, provided by the cyber risk management service for example, may be paired with changes to the policy criteria of a policy.  For example, implementation of certain recommendations may be paired with
automatic renewal, a consequent lower (or higher or otherwise changed) cyber risk policy premium, better coverage limits, better term length, future valuation and the like.  For example, the change to the policy criteria of the policy may be implemented
after the end of the term (e.g., 1, 3, 6 or 12 months, or any other appropriate term) of the current policy, or may trigger a renewal option at the lower premium rate immediately or on an accelerated basis.  In this manner, a cooperative and constructive
relationship may be achieved between insurers and insured-entities, thereby creating a positive feedback loop of improved cyber preparedness and lower/higher/changed premiums.  As discussed previously, implementation of recommendations provided by the
cyber risk management service may cause a change in any element of the policy criteria of a cyber policy.  For example, if the sophistication of the entity is low, a higher deductible may be required, and vice versa.  Additionally or alternatively, the
type of coverage, a pricing or re-pricing, the amount of limits, an automatic renewal, and/or a renewal commitment, may change based on an increase or decrease in sophistication of the entity, and/or an increase or decrease in motivation of an attacker
of the entity.  Additionally, as recommendations are implemented, or other changes in the entity or the entity's situation, the motivation and sophistication, or other metrics, may change, and consequently a new analysis may be provided including new
and/or changed recommendations for the entity.
<BR><BR> Additionally or alternatively, the policy criteria of the policy itself may determine and/or change the weighting used in the system 505.  In still further embodiments, a policy may affect the system 505 in other ways.  In other words, the
policy criteria of a policy may impact an assessment of a cyber risk, and/or an assessment service.  For example, if a policy has a high deductible, the assessment service may not assess a motivation to initiate a security event.  Various other options
for having the policy criteria of a policy drive the type of assessment conducted are also possible.
<BR><BR> The cyber risk management service as provided herein may include subjective evaluations, and may include vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, tabletop exercises, people services, risk engineering, and/or training exercises.  Changes
or renewed evaluations of any of these assessments may cause an increase or decrease in a sophistication of the entity, an increase or decrease in a motivation of an attacker of the entity, and/or a change in any other metric used to evaluate an entity. 
Any of these changes based on a new or revised assessment may cause a remediation service and/or a new or additional assessment service, to be implemented.  Trends, averages and/or changes to an assessment or evaluation may impact policy criteria of a
cyber security policy, as discussed herein.
<BR><BR> Various embodiments of the present technology can be practiced with a local computer system, and/or a cloud-based system.  FIG. 5 is a high level schematic diagram of a computing architecture (hereinafter architecture 500) of the present
technology.  The architecture 500 comprises a system 505, which in some embodiments comprises a server or cloud-based computing device configured specifically to perform the diversity analyses described herein.  That is, the system 505 is a particular
purpose computing device that is specifically designed and programmed (e.g., configured or adapted) to perform any of the methods described herein.  The system 505 can be coupled with entity device 530 using a network 520.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the system 505 comprises a processor 510 and memory 515 for storing instructions.  The memory 515 can include a recommendation module 540.  As used herein, the terms "module" may also refer to any of an application-specific
integrated circuit ("ASIC"), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) that executes one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described
functionality.
<BR><BR> The system 505 may gather variables for an entity by querying the entity for information, scraping available online sources such as websites, corporate filings, news sources, other public record databases, and other resources.  Additionally,
data may be gathered from the entity's network using devices already present there or by placing a new device on the entity's network to gather more data.  The data collecting device may be a server, router, firewall, switch, or repeater, or may be a
software agent or routine that monitors traffic and/or performs packet inspection.  The data collecting device may be on the company's network and/or its periphery, and may collect and/or analyze the data, while also transmitting it to system 505.  In
this manner, additional, proprietary data may be gleaned from a particular entity's network.  The variables or a subset of the variables can be compared.  The comparison can be for all or only a subset of all entities.  The subset of variables can be
selected by the end user, as well as the entities analyzed.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the system 505 provides interfaces or adapters 505A-N that allow various resources to communicatively couple with the system 505.  As an example, the system 505 can use an application program interface (API) or other
communication interface.  FIG. 5 illustrates example resources that can couple with the system 505.  The system 505 can interrogate, for example, various databases such as corporate filings, news sources, and other public record databases.  In another
example, cloud services such as cloud storage and cloud computing environments.  In general, a cloud-based computing environment is a resource that typically combines the computational <B><I>power</I></B> of a large grouping of processors and/or that combines the
storage capacity of a large grouping of computer memories or storage devices.  For example, systems that provide a cloud resource may be utilized exclusively by their owners; or such systems may be accessible to outside users who deploy applications
within the computing infrastructure to obtain the benefit of large computational or storage resources.  The cloud may be formed, for example, by a network of servers with each server (or at least a plurality thereof) providing processor and/or storage
resources.  These servers may manage workloads provided by multiple users (e.g., cloud resource customers or other users).  Typically, each user may place workload demands upon the cloud that vary in real-time, sometimes dramatically.  The nature and
extent of these variations typically depend on the type of business associated with the user.
<BR><BR> The system 505 may also couple with the Internet as well as data feeds such as RSS feeds or social networks.  Email behaviors can also be identified by interrogating email servers or email repositories.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the system 505 can use vulnerability assessments generated by the entity or a third party, such as a cyber-security firm.
<BR><BR> In contrast with a vulnerability assessment, which is more technical in nature, the present technology can also consider non-technical or semi-technical aspects of an entity and how these elements impact the cyber vulnerability of the entity. 
For example, non-technical elements include, but are not limited to, company size, revenue, company location, company industry sector, as well as other elements which are described herein.  The present technology provides benefits above and beyond a
typical vulnerability assessment, providing users with a robust and comprehensive view of a company's (or multiple companies') overall cyber security risk.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the system 505 can obtain sophistication information about entities from the following non-limiting list of sources or resources: (a) Framework; (b) Hosting/infrastructure; (c) Account management; (d) Authentication; (e)
Authorization; (f) Scanning; (g) System vulnerability; (h) Ad/Partner integration; (i) Files/Directories/Links; and (j) Patching.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the system 505 can obtain sophistication information about entities from the following non-limiting list of sources or resources: (a) Customer Reviews; (b) Employee reviews; (c) Traffic statistics; (d) Business events/news;
(e) Corporate connections; (f) Business type; (g) Customer data; (h) Brand/Revenue; (i) Employee profiles; (j) Social Media/Blogs; (k) Industry/Products; (l) Data Types; and (m) Company/Subsidiary connections.
<BR><BR> For purposes of context, facets or features relating the motivation regarding a security failure (e.g., motivation of some actor, such as a hacker, to attack an entity, to expose sensitive information, to name a few) as well as the
sophistication of the entity in preventing or dealing with a cyber security event will be referred to herein as an element.  Thus, there can be a plurality of types of sophistication elements and a plurality of types of motivation elements.  The actor
may be a hacker, employee, another entity, to name a few.
<BR><BR> Examples of motivation elements include: visibility; value; hacker sentiment; employee sentiment; company sentiment; customer sentiment, and combinations thereof--just to name a few.  Each of these motivation elements may be further
subcategorized as follows.  Visibility may include information and/or derived measures related to the traffic, usage, and activity related to an entity, including but not limited to the in-links; pageviews; duration; traffic; links; page rank; market
value; daily (stock) trade volume; exporting/importing; and combinations thereof--just to name a few.  Value includes: revenue; net income; total assets; employees; and combinations thereof--just to name a few.  Hacker sentiment includes: emails; credit
cards; foreign languages; etc., which can be gathered from hacker forums and/or discussion groups, chat rooms, dark web, or dark net forums, such as the Tor Network, Internet <B><I>Relay</I></B> Chat (IRC), and combinations thereof--just to name a few.  Employee
sentiment includes: career opportunities; work/life balance; compensation; and combinations thereof--just to name a few.  Company sentiment includes: senior leadership ratings; overall company ratings; recommendations; etc. Customer sentiment includes:
product ratings; service ratings, and combinations thereof--just to name a few.
<BR><BR> The present technology determines a level of sophistication of the entity.  Sophistication may be considered a measure of People, Process, and Technology.  People indicates how security-aware the entities' employees, principals and/or members
are.  In particular, do the people associated with the entity understand the risks, are they competent in security, and combinations thereof.  Process indicates whether procedures and/or policies have clear and enforceable terms, and clearly indicate
what to do in case of various events, including attacks.  Process also indicates whether training is provided to employees, third party contractors and/or service providers, indicates their level of expertise, and combinations thereof.
<BR><BR> Examples of sophistication elements include: hosting infrastructure; topology; vulnerability scanning; people; and combinations thereof--just to name a few.  Hosting infrastructure includes; content distribution networks; shared hosting; cloud
providers; etc. Topology includes: accessibility points; page layout; content on site; etc. Vulnerability scanning includes: CVEs (common vulnerabilities and exposures); patching; updating; default passwords; etc. People includes: chief information
security officer (CISO); security team; skills; job postings; etc. In this manner, sophistication encompasses more than just vulnerability, and additionally includes people and processes that may impact a defensive posture of an entity.
<BR><BR> Determining these variables may be a data gathering operation, which may be based on public information or a company's own data networks, as discussed herein.  A cyber risk assessment, for instance a two by two (or higher order) graph, may be
output, along with a composite score, a peer rank, an estimated commercial impact, and recommendations to decrease the cyber risk.  These may all be output for each company assessed.  All of these elements may be updated over time and in response to
implementation of recommendations, thus, transforming the original data via the use of a particular computer.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the system 505 is configured to evaluate each data point with respect to history, lineage, provenance (e.g., origin), source, time, entities and other details.  The system 505 can then cleanse and standardize the data
points.  Examples of cleansing and standardizing using data normalization are described in greater detail below.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the system 505 can use a canonical representation of the data points.  As mentioned above, the system 505 can track entities and their attributes/elements over time.  The system 505 is also configured to process rollups
(e.g., summarizing the data along a dimension), aggregations, transforms, reductions, normalizations, deltas, as well as other types of data transformation or conversion processes that can also be used to convert the motivation/sophistication/combination
elements into scores.
<BR><BR> The system 505 then generates module-ready data for use with matrices of elements (motivation/sophistication) for one or more entities.  In some embodiments, the system 505 then executes one or more models to generate scores, results,
recommendations, delta values (changes in scores over time), as well as historical tracking of scores.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the system 505 comprises a scoring and plotting module 535 that is generally configured to calculate sophistication scores, motivation scores, and combination scores; apply weighting to sophistication and/or motivation
elements in various calculations; compare scores to threshold values; benchmark various scores over time; as well as other features described herein.  Sophistication scores may also be referred to as susceptibility scores.
<BR><BR> In a second set of functions, the scoring and plotting module 535 can create visual representations such as the graphs illustrated in FIGS. 6-12.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the scoring and plotting module 535 is configured to calculate various scores for an entity.  In another embodiment the scoring and plotting module 535 can calculate various scores for a plurality of entities.  Again, these
various scores can be calculated over time and utilized for benchmarking cyber security performance for an entity, or a group of entities that possess a particular attribute in common.  For example, the scoring and plotting module 535 can calculate
scores for groups of entities in an industry group, a geographical location, a company size, a technology sector, and so forth.
<BR><BR> In an example calculation, the scoring and plotting module 535 is configured to calculate a motivation score for one or more entities.  The scoring and plotting module 535 obtains motivation elements collected from the various resources and
converts this information into a mathematical representation.  In one embodiment, a motivation element of pageviews can be mathematically represented by comparing the pageviews of the entity to a set of thresholds.  For context, the pageviews could be a
pageview of a particular webpage or set of webpages.  To be sure, the higher profile and more visited a website is, the more likely that it will be attractive to a hacker, especially if other motivation factors are present such as the entity being
involved in commercial activities, just for example.
<BR><BR> For purposes of obtaining a coherent scoring scheme, the scoring and plotting module 535 may normalize various elements to obtain mathematical values that are usable in an algorithm for scoring motivation or sophistication.  By way of example,
each of the set of thresholds is associated with a mathematical value.  If the entity has pageviews in excess of 10,000 unique users in one day, the entity is given a score of five.  If the entity has pageviews in excess of 100,000 unique users in one
day, the entity is given a score of ten.  If the entity has pageviews in excess of 200,000 unique users in one day, the entity is given a score of fifteen.  Again, these are merely examples of possible ways to convert pageviews into a mathematical
representation that can be combined with other mathematical representations of other motivation elements in order to create an overall motivation score.
<BR><BR> In other examples, an employee sentiment can be represented mathematically as a percentage of positive versus negative comments from employees.  In another example, negative employee behaviors, actions, or statements can be counted over time and
compared to thresholds (in a method similar to that above with respect to pageviews).
<BR><BR> Each of the motivation elements (if necessary) is converted into a mathematical representation.  The ultimate motivation score can be calculated by taking a sum of each mathematical representation of motivation elements.  In some embodiments,
the motivation score can be a representation of one or a combination of many motivation elements.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the system 505 can be configured to weight one or more of the elements in a score calculation.  For example, if it is determined that certain elements are more likely to increase the likelihood of a security failure (e.g., a
cyber attack, a privacy incident), these elements can be assigned a weight.  In an example, the weight is applied by multiplying a mathematical representation of an element by a coefficient or factor.  If an element value for pageviews is five, a
weighting could include multiplying this number by a coefficient of 0.5, which reduces the impact of that value on the overall score.  Increases in element values can also be achieved.
<BR><BR> While the above examples reference motivation elements, the scoring and plotting module 535 is also configured to process sophistication elements to obtain sophistication scores.  The exact details for converting sophistication/motivation
elements into mathematical representations will vary according to the type of information included in the elements.  To be sure, some types of elements such as pageviews and revenue are inherently more mathematical in their quantities, while other
elements are more non-mathematical in nature such as employee or customer sentiment.  For non-mathematical elements, users can develop suitable schemes or algorithms for converting or quantifying these elements into mathematical form.
<BR><BR> According to some embodiments, the scoring and plotting module 535 can determine various facets of an entity or group of entities by comparing the motivation, sophistication, and/or combined scores of these entities.  Answers to pertinent
questions can be deduced or inferred from the comparison.
<BR><BR> For example, in one embodiment, the scoring and plotting module 535 is configured to determine a position of an entity within an aggregate risk score of a portfolio of entities.  Thus, the scoring and plotting module 535 has been used to
calculate an aggregate risk score (motivation, sophistication, and/or combined) for numerous entities.  In one embodiment, the scoring and plotting module 535 selects a plurality of motivation elements and analyzes these elements for each of a portfolio
(plurality) of entities using the above examples as a guide for calculating motivation scores.  In some embodiments, the same motivation elements are used for each entity.
<BR><BR> The scoring and plotting module 535 can then determine where the entity lies within the group of scores.  For example, out of 30 entities, a subject entity places 25th out of thirty.
<BR><BR> The scoring and plotting module 535 can also be utilized to generate graphs and GUIs that display various scores in graphical format(s).  For example, in FIG. 6, a graph with two axes is illustrated.  The graph 600 comprises a vertical axis that
is representative of motivation elements, and the horizontal axis is representative of sophistication elements.  Indeed, this graph can be used to display information about a single entity or a plurality of entities.
<BR><BR> In one embodiment, the motivation axis is delineated or stratified based on the type of content.  Less important types of secure information are located towards the bottom of the axis, whereas more important types of information are located at
the top part of the axis.  In this embodiment, the lower part of the motivation axis references payment cards (e.g., credit cards) and other types of general consumer information.  Above that is online crime such as phishing, malware, and other malicious
behavior.  Above online crime is IP theft and industrial espionage.  At the top of the motivation axis are state secrets.  To be sure, other categories of information types will lie somewhere along this axis, if not specifically mentioned.  Furthermore,
the axis can be defined by other types of information points.  For example, an entity can structure their motivation axis to include information that they deal with, structured from least important to most important.
<BR><BR> In the sophistication axis, which is the horizontal axis, hacker profiles are listed from left to right on the axis from a lowest impact actor type to a highest impact actor type.  For example, actor types can include casual hackers,
professional hackers, organized crime, and state actors.  Each of these actor types has a different threat level associated therewith.  The sophistication axis represents the strength or threat level that it takes to successfully hack the subject
entity/entities.
<BR><BR> FIG. 7 is an example graphical user interface (GUI) that comprises scatter plot illustrating an entity's motivation and sophistication relative to cyber risk.  The scatter plot 700 comprises a vertical motivation axis and a horizontal
sophistication axis.  Each of the points plotted on the scatter plot 700 represent an entity.  Again, these entities can be analyzed together because they are a part of an entity group (e.g., industry group, same geographical location, same company size,
etc.).
<BR><BR> FIG. 8 is an example graphical user interface (GUI) that comprises a bar graph illustrating the plotting of a plurality of entities based on their combination scores.  The bar graph 800 comprises a vertical axis that represents a number of
companies and a horizontal axis that represents combination scores for a set of entities.  For example, most entities in the group have combination scores (sophistication and motivation) that fall within a score range of 51-60.  Other groups of entities
fall within other score ranges.
<BR><BR> To be sure the system 505 can cause an elemental analysis of these similar scoring groups to identify what elements are shared between the entities, what elements are different, and so forth.  Thus, the graphing of entities based on scores aids
the system 505 in identifying groups of entities that require attention.  For example, the entities in the score range of 31-40 are severely underperforming.
<BR><BR> FIG. 9 is an example graphical user interface (GUI) that comprises a bar graph illustrating the plotting of a plurality of entities based on their sophistication scores.  The bar graph 900 comprises a vertical axis that represents a number of
companies and a horizontal axis that represents sophistication scores for a set of entities.
<BR><BR> FIG. 10 is an example graphical user interface (GUI) that comprises a bar graph illustrating the plotting of a plurality of entities based on their motivation scores.  The bar graph 1000 comprises a vertical axis that represents a number of
companies and a horizontal axis that represents motivation scores for a set of entities.
<BR><BR> By comparing these graphs illustrated in FIGS. 8-10, underperformance in sophistication and/or motivation can be quickly and easily determined, at least on a high level.  Again, a more granular element analysis can be conducted when groups with
underperforming sophistication/motivation scores are identified.
<BR><BR> FIG. 11 is an example graphical user interface (GUI) that comprises a scatter plot that represents a plurality of entities plotted according to their combination score.  The scatter plot 1100 includes a plurality of data points that each
represents an entity.  The scatter plot 1100 comprises a vertical axis that represents motivation and a horizontal axis that represents sophistication scores for a set of entities.  The higher risk area on the plot is where the motivation to hack is high
and the sophistication of the entity is low.
<BR><BR> The system 505 can create a line 1105 of acceptable motivation/sophistication scores.  Companies falling below this line 1105 have a suitable cyber risk profile, whereas companies above the line have an unsuitable cyber risk profile.  These
companies can be identified and analyzed in order to suggest recommendations for improving their cyber risk.
<BR><BR> FIG. 12 is an example graphical user interface (GUI) 1200 that comprises a scatter plot that represents a plurality of entities plotted according to their combination score, as well as additional graphical representations for an entity and a
list of recommendations based on the plotting.  The scatter plot includes a line 1205 of acceptable motivation/sophistication scores.
<BR><BR> The plot is similar to that of FIG. 11, with the addition of two graphical representations.  For example, a linear slide 1220 displays the position of an entity within a peer group of entities.  This same relationship position is illustrated in
a gauge graph 1210.
<BR><BR> In response to making a cyber risk assessment, the recommendation module 540 can be executed to provide the end user (or entity) with some type of actionable feedback.  For example, the recommendation module 540 can provide the end user one or
more actions to the end user based on the diversity score and the clusters of similar variables.  This is described in further detail above.  These one or more actions potentially decrease the cyber risk of the entity.  In one example, the recommendation
module 540 can automatically identify variables, which if changed, would affect the cyber risk assessment.  In further exemplary embodiments, entities may agree to automatic implementation of recommendations in exchange for lower policy premiums.
<BR><BR> As best illustrated in FIG. 12, a set of recommendations 1215 is provided along with the graphical analysis generated for the entity.  Again, these recommendations are based on the system 505 having knowledge of the motivation elements,
sophistication elements, as well as the scores calculated not only for the entity, but other entities (in some embodiments).
<BR><BR> Exemplary methods and systems according to the present technology may also provide benchmarking over time.  In this manner, the system 505 can track, for a company or group or entities, cyber risk over a selectable time period, for example days,
weeks, months, and/or years.  This benchmarking may be against a dynamic or static evaluation of the peer group, for instance, an entity's past and present cyber risk tracked against a static past peer group, static present peer group, and/or dynamic
peer group.  The present technology provides information related to the updated information (the new motivation score, the new sophistication score, the new composite score, etc.), including differences (the amount of the change made in one or more
updates, namely the delta), and trends (patterns over many time steps).
<BR><BR> FIG. 13 is a flowchart of an example method 1300 of the present technology.  The method 1300 includes the system 505 assessing 1305 risk of a cyber security failure in a computer network of an entity, using a computer agent configured to collect
information from at least publicly accessible Internet elements.  The cyber risk includes a security failure (e.g., a cyber attack, a privacy incident) of the entity.
<BR><BR> The system 505 may query the entity for information, scrape available online sources such as websites, corporate filings, news sources, other public record databases, and other resources.  Additionally, data may be gathered from the entity's
network using devices already present there or by placing a new data collecting device on the entity's network to gather more data.  The data collecting device may be on the company's network and/or its periphery, and may collect and/or analyze the data,
while also transmitting it to the system 505.  In this example, additional, proprietary data may be gleaned from a particular entity's network.
<BR><BR> The exemplary method 1300 also includes the system 505 automatically determining 1310, based on the assessed risk, a change or a setting to at least one element of policy criteria of a cyber security policy.  In some embodiments, the at least
one element of policy criteria involves a term or condition of a cyber policy.  In one embodiment, the cyber security policy includes a cyber security insurance policy.
<BR><BR> Next, in this example, the method 1300 includes the system 505 automatically recommending 1315, based on the assessed risk, computer network changes to reduce the assessed risk
<BR><BR> Next, in this example, the method 1300 includes the system 505 providing 1320 one or more recommended computer network changes to reduce the assessed risk, enactment by the entity of at least one of the one or more of the recommended computer
network changes to reduce the assessed risk to the entity.
<BR><BR> The exemplary method 1300 also includes the system 505 determining 1325 that the entity has enacted at least a portion of the recommended computer network changes, and in response, automatically reassessing the cyber security risk of a cyber
security failure in the computer network of the entity based on the enacted recommended computer network changes.
<BR><BR> Next, the exemplary method 1300 includes the system 505 dynamically re-determining 1330, based on the reassessed risk of a cyber security failure in the computer network of the entity, the change or the setting to the at least one element of
policy criteria of the cyber security policy.
<BR><BR> FIG. 14 is a flowchart of an example method 1400.  The method 1400 includes the system 505, based on the assessing of risk of the cyber security failure in the computer network of the entity, plotting 1405 one or more features of the entity and
other members of a peer group of the entity, the plotting being configured to visually illustrate the risk of a cyber security failure in the computer network of the entity; and the automatically recommending of computer network changes being based on
the plotting.
<BR><BR> Next, the method 1400 includes the system 505, in response to the determining that the entity has enacted at least a portion of the recommended computer network changes, initiating 1410 the change or the setting to the at least one element of
policy criteria of the cyber security policy.
<BR><BR> Next, the method 1400 for the assessing of risk of the cyber security failure in the computer network of the entity includes the system 505, using 1415 a plurality of sophistication elements for the entity, a sophistication for the entity with
respect to preventing the cyber security failure, the sophistication being one of features of the entity.  Again, the sophistication relates to people, processes, and technology.  The sophistication analysis as a whole attempts to quantify how strong a
threat actor would be required to execute a successful security failure of the entity.
<BR><BR> Next, the method 1400 for the assessing of risk of the cyber security failure in the computer network of the entity includes the system 505 assessing, using a plurality of motivation elements regarding the entity, a motivation of an actor to
initiate the cyber security failure, the motivation being one of a plurality of features of the entity.  In some embodiments motivation is a motivation of an actor (e.g., a hacker) to initiate a cyber security failure.
<BR><BR> FIG. 15 is a flowchart of yet another example method 1500 for modifying a policy based on a cyber risk analysis.  The method 1500 includes the system 505 assessing 1505, using a plurality of sophistication elements for the entity, a
sophistication for the entity with respect to preventing the cyber security failure, the sophistication being one of a plurality of features of the entity; and assessing, using a plurality of motivation elements regarding the entity, a motivation of an
actor to initiate the cyber security failure, the motivation being another one of the features of the entity.  Again, the sophistication relates to people, processes, and technology.  The sophistication analysis as a whole attempts to quantify how strong
a threat actor would be required to cause a successful cyber failure.
<BR><BR> Next, the method 1500 in various embodiments includes the system 505 calculating 1510 a composite score from a motivation score and a sophistication score, the motivation score representing the plurality of motivation elements, the
sophistication score representing the plurality of sophistication elements.
<BR><BR> To be sure, steps 1505 and 1510 include the collection of motivation and sophistication elements, converting these elements into mathematical representations (if needed), and processing these elements into scores using relevant algorithms.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the method 1500 includes the system 505 creating 1515 an aggregate risk score of a portfolio of entities based on a plurality of motivation scores including the motivation score and a plurality of sophistication scores
including the sophistication score; and benchmarking over time at least one of the sophistication score, the motivation score, the composite score, and the aggregate risk score.
<BR><BR> Next, the method 1500 in some embodiments includes the system 505 identifying 1520 clusters of sophistication elements or motivation elements shared between two or more entities of the portfolio of entities, the clusters of sophistication
elements or motivation elements being associated with an increase in risk of a cyber security failure in the computer network of the entity.
<BR><BR> Next, the method 1500 in some instances includes the system 505 identifying 1525 additional sophistication elements or motivation elements for at least one of the two or more entities of the portfolio of entities that are not shared with the
portfolio of entities, the additional sophistication elements or motivation elements being associated with another increase in the risk of a cyber security failure in the computer network of the entity; and generating recommendations for the at least one
of the two or more entities of the portfolio of entities that will cause a decrease in the risk of a cyber security failure in the computer network of the entity.
<BR><BR> According to some embodiments, the system 505 can be programmed with policy parameters.  The system 505 can generate recommendations for the insurer based on the motivation and sophistication analysis of the entity.  In some instances, the
recommendation could be to deny a policy or terminate a policy if the entity has motivation or sophistication elements that are defined by the policy as being unacceptable or uninsurable.
<BR><BR> According to some embodiments, the present disclosure provides systems and methods that allow for assessment of cyber security vulnerabilities of a cyber asset of an entity.  The systems and methods can also determine association or
interconnectedness of a plurality of cyber assets owned by the same entity.  These interrelated assets are referred to as an external infrastructure.  The systems and methods are configured to assess these public facing external infrastructure assets in
a passive manner, meaning that the systems and methods assess vulnerabilities available to third parties.  These vulnerabilities pose a more general risk than cyber attacks or intrusions that would occur when a hacker gains access to a private network or
intranet, although the systems and methods of the present disclosure can assess vulnerabilities for these types of networks as well.  Indeed, some of the informational sources interrogated by the systems and methods of the present disclosure may also
determine vulnerabilities for private network assets when inspecting for vulnerabilities on public facing cyber assets, such as company web pages.
<BR><BR> The systems and methods of the present disclosure can utilize direct or circumstantial evidence gathered from the information sources that have been interrogated and deduce cyber asset vulnerabilities.  For example, the system determines that a
company hosts their website on a domain host that has hosted other entity websites that have experienced significant cyber security breaches in the recent past.  The system can recommend changes to network configurations that provide enhanced security in
view of these known vulnerabilities or suggest other hosts that could host the company's website that have a lesser likelihood of experiencing a cyber security failure.  In some embodiments, the system assesses bad activity (e.g., malware, spam, etc.)
associated with each of these hosts and domains.  In certain embodiments, the system also updates the list of information sources, from which circumstantial or direct evidence is to be queried and gathered, based on findings from evidence gathered from
prior queries, e.g., update subdomain dictionary, change timing of next query, etc. In some embodiments, the system leverages information gathered (across information sources and time) for a particular infrastructure to automatically create a behavior
footprint of that infrastructure.
<BR><BR> In response to detected vulnerabilities, the present disclosure provides methods for calculating association scores, actionable feedback that will reduce cyber security vulnerabilities, as well as dynamic reassessments of cyber security
vulnerabilities after enactment (either proposed or actual) of recommendations, and so forth.
<BR><BR> FIG. 16 illustrates an example method 1600 of the present disclosure.  The method 1600 includes determining 1605 an external infrastructure of an entity.  As mentioned above, the external infrastructure can comprise one or more cyber assets
utilized by the entity.  By way of example, the entity can provide the system with a one or more domain names of websites owned and operated by the entity.  For computer systems with multiple domains, various embodiments review the associated network
interconnectivity.  In other embodiments, a cyber asset may be owned by the entity but not operated by the entity, such as a content delivery network account or a cloud storage space.  The entity owns an account with the cloud provider, but may not
necessarily operate the cloud storage system.  In certain embodiments, the system according to the present disclosure locates supply chain and other third party vendors, e.g., cloud providers, internet service providers (ISPs), to name a few.
<BR><BR> Associated cyber assets can be determined from inspecting the cyber assets identified by the entity.  For example, a domain registrar or domain host can be determined from an IP address associated with the domain names provided by the entity. 
Associated cyber assets can be determined, for example, by evaluating information on a website.  By example, an employee of the entity has an email address that can be tracked back to a specific email server.  This email server would be added to the
cyber asset portfolio for the entity.
<BR><BR> After the cyber assets have been determined and logical connections between the cyber assets have been assessed, the method 1600 includes a step of collecting 1610 infrastructure information regarding the one or more cyber assets.
<BR><BR> This process may involve querying the entity for information, scraping available online sources such as websites, corporate filings, news sources, other public record databases, and other resources.  Additionally, data may be gathered from the
entity's network using devices already present there or by placing a new data collecting device on the entity's network to gather more data.  The data collecting device may be on the company's network and/or its periphery, and may collect and/or analyze
the data, while also transmitting it to system.  In this example, additional, proprietary data may be gleaned from a particular entity's network.
<BR><BR> Some examples of infrastructure information include, but are not limited to, exposed sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, email addresses, social security numbers, authentication credentials, encryption information, and so forth. 
In general, infrastructure information includes any sensitive information that could be used by a hacker to gain unauthorized entry to any of the cyber assets.
<BR><BR> In one example, the method 1600 includes scanning or searching known information sources such as the dark web, forums, threads, feeds, or other online resources used by hackers or the general public to share information that could be used in a
cyber attack or other cyber security failure event against the entity.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the method 1600 includes performing 1615 passive cyber security vulnerability testing on the one or more cyber assets using the collected infrastructure information.  The passive cyber security vulnerability testing could
include comparing email addresses for corporate employees against email addresses located in a hacker forum on the Internet.  If email address match, the entity has increased cyber security vulnerability.  The methods utilize passive, rather than active
cyber security vulnerability testing, in some embodiments.  An example of a passive vulnerability test would be comparing a username and/or password for a website found on a hacker website to a list of usernames and/or passwords provided by the entity. 
The systems need not actually utilize the username and/or password and gain access to properly assess cyber security vulnerabilities.  This passive activity does not require actual access to the entity's website for confirmation.
<BR><BR> By analogy, assume a key pattern is found on the Internet.  This key pattern can be used to match a key that opens a particular lock on a home.  The home owner has a copy of the key in their possession.  There is no need for the security agency
to create a matching key using the pattern, unlock the door and enter the home to determine that a security risk exists.  The ability to confirm that the key pattern against the key possessed by the home owner is sufficient.
<BR><BR> Thus, the method 1600 includes assessing 1620 cyber security vulnerabilities of the one or more cyber assets based on the performing of passive cyber security vulnerability testing.  In some embodiments, this process includes determining a
severity of the vulnerabilities, a number of vulnerabilities, or other similar criteria.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the method 1600 includes calculating, in step 1625, an association score for the one or more cyber assets based on the assessed cyber security vulnerabilities.  The score can represent an overall representation of cyber
security vulnerabilities for the entity across the plurality of cyber assets.
<BR><BR> According to some embodiments, the method 1600 includes automatically recommending, in step 1630, based on the association score, computer network changes to reduce the assessed cyber security vulnerabilities.  For example, the entity can be
encouraged to change domain hosts if problems with the domain hosts are determined or the entity is provided a recommendation to encrypt their email usage if their email domain has experienced cyber security issues with their email clients.
<BR><BR> FIG. 17 illustrates an example method 1700 that involves a feedback process that utilizes the assessed cyber security vulnerabilities.  The method 1700 includes a step of automatically determining 1705, based on the assessed cyber security
vulnerabilities, at least one of a change and a setting to at least one element of policy criteria of a cyber security policy.
<BR><BR> For example, the system can automatically upwardly adjust a deductible for the entity if their cyber security vulnerabilities meet or exceed a tolerance threshold.  A corresponding downward adjustment can be made if the entity has low cyber
security vulnerabilities.  In another example the system can update the policy to require intrusion or network penetration testing to occur more frequently if the cyber security vulnerabilities are detected.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the method 1700 includes automatic recommendations as in step 1630 of the method 1600 of FIG. 16.  If the entity subsequently enacts the recommendations, the method 1700 can include initiating 1710 the change or the setting
to the at least one element of policy criteria of the cyber security policy of the entity.  For example, if the entity chooses a different domain host, the system can automatically adjust the deductible of the policy down to an agreed amount.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the method 1700 includes determining 1715 that the entity has enacted at least a portion of the recommended computer network changes for the one or more cyber assets, and in response, automatically re-performing passive
cyber security vulnerability testing on the one or more cyber assets based on the recommended computer network changes.  Thus, the process includes a confirmation of the actions taken as well as a confirmation that the enacted changes actually resulted
in a reduction or improvement of the cyber security vulnerabilities.
<BR><BR> According to some embodiments, the method 1700 includes dynamically reassessing 1720 cyber security vulnerabilities of the one or more cyber assets, based on the re-performed passive cyber security vulnerability testing.  If the cyber security
vulnerabilities have indeed decreased, the method 1700 can include a modification or change to a cyber policy for the entity.  In other embodiments, the reduction in cyber security vulnerabilities is necessary to maintain a current set of policies or
settings of the cyber security policy.
<BR><BR> FIG. 18 is a flowchart of another example method 1800 of the present disclosure.  The method 1800 includes a step of assessing 1805 a plurality of online resources of an entity.  As mentioned above, this process includes determining directly or
indirectly, the websites or online resources owned and/or operated by an entity.  In sum, these are online cyber assets that may cause the entity to suffer a loss due to cyber attacks or other malicious cyber actions.
<BR><BR> Next, the method 1800 includes collecting 1810 identifying information for the plurality of online resources.  For example, IP address, domain names, registrar information, domain host information, DNS server IP addresses, as well as any other
information that could be used to determine, deduce, or infer information about the cyber assets of the entity.
<BR><BR> According to some embodiments, the method 1800 includes searching, in step 1815, based on the collected identifying information for the plurality of online resources, for information sources that have exposed sensitive information regarding the
plurality of online resources.  In the examples provided above, the system can search known websites or other online resources for secure or sensitive information that pertains to the cyber assets.
<BR><BR> In another example, information is determined from news sources, trade journals, or other resources that may provide information regarding cyber security vulnerability or attacks against entities such as the entity that owns the cyber assets or
entities that use the same online resources as the entity being analyzed.  For example, it may be determined that the entity is using a CDN that has been subjected to cyber attacks within the past six months.  In another example it is determined that
other companies that use the same email server have had their email communications compromised.  Again, these are merely examples of cyber vulnerabilities that can be directly determined or deduced from the information sources searched in step 1815.
<BR><BR> Next, the method 1800 includes determining 1820 cyber security vulnerabilities using the exposed sensitive information.  This could include a review of a level of vulnerability.  For example, the information sources may indicate that a
particular CDN has problems with data loss due to faulty system maintenance issues.  This particular problem determined by the system may be evaluated as a less problematic cyber vulnerability than employee authentication credentials being sold on a
hacker website.
<BR><BR> To be sure, while many of the examples provided herein involve the aspect of malicious activity and related vulnerability, the methods provided herein can also involve cyber vulnerability due to poor network infrastructures and services that may
cause monetary damage to the entity.  For example, the entity may be financially damaged when their customers cannot access the services of the entity when a CDN or cloud provider (or other vendor) of the entity has a network, hardware, or services
failure.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the method 1800 can include automatically recommending 1825, based on the cyber security vulnerabilities, computer network changes for the plurality of online resources to reduce the cyber security vulnerabilities.  The
computer network changes could comprise switching a CDN network used by the entity, for example.  In another example, the computer network changes could include changing a service level agreement with a cloud provider to ensure that the entity receives a
level of service that exceeds the requirements needed by the entity to ensure that the entity never (or rarely) experiences latency.
<BR><BR> FIG. 19 is a diagrammatic representation of an example machine in the form of a computer system 1, within which a set of instructions for causing the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein may be executed.  In
various example embodiments, the machine operates as a standalone device or may be connected (e.g., networked) to other machines.  In a networked deployment, the machine may operate in the capacity of a server or a client machine in a server-client
network environment, or as a peer machine in a peer-to-peer (or distributed) network environment.  The machine may be a personal computer (PC), a tablet PC, a set-top box (STB), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, a portable music
player (e.g., a portable hard drive audio device such as an Moving Picture Experts Group Audio Layer 3 (MP3) player), a web appliance, a network router, switch or bridge, or any machine capable of executing a set of instructions (sequential or otherwise)
that specify actions to be taken by that machine.  Further, while only a single machine is illustrated, the term "machine" shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set (or multiple sets) of
instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.
<BR><BR> The example computer system 1 includes a processor or multiple processor(s) 5 (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), or both), and a main memory 10 and static memory 15, which communicate with each other via a
bus 20.  The computer system 1 may further include a video display 35 (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD)).  The computer system 1 may also include an alpha-numeric input device(s) 30 (e.g., a keyboard), a cursor control device (e.g., a mouse), a voice
recognition or biometric verification unit (not shown), a drive unit 37 (also referred to as disk drive unit), a signal generation device 40 (e.g., a speaker), and a network interface device 45.  The computer system 1 may further include a data

constitute machine-readable media.
<BR><BR> The instructions 55 may further be transmitted or received over a network (e.g., network 105B or network 520, see FIG. 1 and FIG. 5, respectively) via the network interface device 45 utilizing any one of a number of well-known transfer protocols
(e.g., Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)).  While the machine-readable medium 50 is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium, the term "computer-readable medium" should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a
centralized or distributed database and/or associated caches and servers) that store the one or more sets of instructions.  The term "computer-readable medium" shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing, encoding, or carrying a
set of instructions for execution by the machine and that causes the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present application, or that is capable of storing, encoding, or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with
such a set of instructions.  The term "computer-readable medium" shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, optical and magnetic media, and carrier wave signals.  Such media may also include, without limitation,
hard disks, floppy disks, flash memory cards, digital video disks, random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), and the like.  The example embodiments described herein may be implemented in an operating environment comprising software installed on

<BR><BR> In the following description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, specific details are set forth, such as particular embodiments, procedures, techniques, etc. in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. 
However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these specific details.
<BR><BR> Reference throughout this specification to "one embodiment" or "an embodiment" means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present
invention.  Thus, the appearances of the phrases "in one embodiment" or "in an embodiment" or "according to one embodiment" (or other phrases having similar import) at various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the
same embodiment.  Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.  Furthermore, depending on the context of discussion herein, a singular term may include its plural
forms and a plural term may include its singular form.  Similarly, a hyphenated term (e.g., "on-demand") may be occasionally interchangeably used with its non-hyphenated version (e.g., "on demand"), a capitalized entry (e.g., "Software") may be
interchangeably used with its non-capitalized version (e.g., "software"), a plural term may be indicated with or without an apostrophe (e.g., PE's or PEs), and an italicized term (e.g., "N+1") may be interchangeably used with its non-italicized version
(e.g., "N+1").  Such occasional interchangeable uses shall not be considered inconsistent with each other.
<BR><BR> Also, some embodiments may be described in terms of "means for" performing a task or set of tasks.  It will be understood that a "means for" may be expressed herein in terms of a structure, such as a processor, a memory, an I/O device such as a
camera, or combinations thereof.  Alternatively, the "means for" may include an algorithm that is descriptive of a function or method step, while in yet other embodiments the "means for" is expressed in terms of a mathematical formula, prose, or as a
flow chart or signal diagram.
<BR><BR> The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention.  As used herein, the singular forms "a", an and the are intended to include the plural forms as well,
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.  It will be further understood that the terms "comprises" and/or "comprising," when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or
components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.
<BR><BR> It is noted at the outset that the terms "coupled," "connected", "connecting," "electrically connected," etc., are used interchangeably herein to generally refer to the condition of being electrically/electronically connected.  Similarly, a
first entity is considered to be in "communication" with a second entity (or entities) when the first entity electrically sends and/or receives (whether through wireline or wireless means) information signals (whether containing data information or
non-data/control information) to the second entity regardless of the type (analog or digital) of those signals.  It is further noted that various figures (including component diagrams) shown and discussed herein are for illustrative purpose only, and are
not drawn to scale.
<BR><BR> While specific embodiments of, and examples for, the system are described above for illustrative purposes, various equivalent modifications are possible within the scope of the system, as those skilled in the relevant art will recognize.  For
example, while processes or steps are presented in a given order, alternative embodiments may perform routines having steps in a different order, and some processes or steps may be deleted, moved, added, subdivided, combined, and/or modified to provide
alternative or sub-combinations.  Each of these processes or steps may be implemented in a variety of different ways.  Also, while processes or steps are at times shown as being performed in series, these processes or steps may instead be performed in
parallel, or may be performed at different times.
<BR><BR> While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation.  The descriptions are not intended to limit the scope of the invention to the particular forms
set forth herein.  To the contrary, the present descriptions are intended to cover such alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims and otherwise
appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art.  Thus, the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments.
