       <BR><CENTER><b>Abstract</b></CENTER>
       <p> A processing-based bypass "fail open" mode is provided for an <B><I>intrusion
     prevention system</I></B> by a primary process running on a first logical core
     (lcore) is used as a control plane, which invokes bypass-open
     run-to-completion threads in other lcores comprising a bypass data plane,
     and which spawns a secondary process to fully configure intrusion
     prevention threads on other lcores to create an <B><I>Intrusion Prevention
     System</I></B> data plane. Upon a ready signal from the secondary process, the
     primary process quiesces such that the secondary process IPS data plane
     exclusively owns and executes on the other lcores.

<CENTER><b><i>Claims</b></i></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR>What is claimed is: <BR><BR> 1.  A method of providing a bypass fail open mode for an inline <B><I>intrusion prevention system</I></B> comprising the steps of: executing by one or more processors a primary process
utilizing a first single logical core as a control plane, the primary process;  configuring one or more logical core pools, two or more network ports, and a bypass option;  starting one or more bypass threads on at least one logical core separate from
the first single logical core, wherein the bypass threads provide a fail-open communications processing between the network ports;  and spawning a secondary process;  while the primary process owns and performs frame processing using one or more bypass
data plane threads: opening an interprocess communication channel by a secondary process control plane with the primary control plane;  initializing and invoking by the secondary process one or more intrusion prevention threads comprising an <B><I>intrusion
prevention system</I></B> data plane, wherein the one or more intrusion prevention threads are executed by one or more logical cores separate from the first logical core to process frames between the network ports;  and notifying the primary process by the
secondary process via the interprocess communication channel of readiness of the intrusion detection threads;  and responsive to receiving the notification, the primary process relinquishing ownership of the network ports and frame processing operations

<BR><BR> This invention is related to systems, methods and computer program products for minimizing operational impact while maintaining integrity of data communication systems when an <B><I>intrusion prevention system</I></B> fails.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
<BR><BR> In network interface card (NIC) terminology, the terms "fail open" and fail safe" are often used differently than in the terminology of electrical switches.  When a firewall "fails open", it appears like a door which is blocked or propped open
so that all network traffic flows through the firewall unimpeded (and unchecked).  If an electrical switch "fails open", it does not provide a complete electrical path between the poles, so no signal passes through it (e.g., antonymous from the network
interface usage).
<BR><BR> Similarly, when a NIC "fails closed", it is thought of as a closed door, thus unselectively blocking all traffic through it.  But, when an electrical switch fails closed, it provides an uninterrupted electrical path between the poles of the
switch.
<BR><BR> For the purposes of this disclosure, we will be using the network interface definitions of these terms, not the electrical circuit definitions, whereas the invention relates not to the physical layer of a communication stack (e.g., metallic,
optical, wireless, etc.) such as layer 1 of the seven-layer Open System Interconnection (OSI) model, but to the layers above the physical layer.  In order for a network interface device such as a router, firewall, etc., to "fail open", it must actively
conduct formatted data, not just electrical signal, such as layers 2 through 6, e.g., data link, network, transport, session and presentation layers, respectively.  As such, in this manner of usage, "failing open" and "failing closed" is more of a
functional and operational mode than it is an electrical conductivity state.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSED EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR> A processing-based bypass "fail open" mode is provided for an inline <B><I>intrusion prevention system</I></B> by a primary process running on a specified logical core (lcore) used as a control plane configuring and invoking one or more bypass-open
run-to-completion (RTC) threads in other specified lcores comprising a bypass data plane, and spawns a secondary process which fully configures intrusion prevention threads on the same lcores used by the bypass data plane which comprises the <B><I>Intrusion
Prevention System</I></B> (IPS) data plane.  Upon a signal from the secondary process, the primary process bypass data plane quiesces, and the secondary process IPS data plane exclusively owns and executes on the data plane lcores. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF
THE DRAWINGS
<BR><BR> The figures presented herein, when considered in light of this description, form a complete disclosure of one or more embodiments, wherein like reference numbers in the figures represent similar or same elements or steps.
<BR><BR> FIGS. 1a and 1b set forth a logical process of at least one embodiment.
<BR><BR> FIG. 2a illustrates a logical cluster of network appliances.
<BR><BR> FIG. 2b shows a physical arrangement of the cluster of FIG. 2a.
<BR><BR> FIG. 3 depicts a generalized computing platform suitable for combination with program instructions to perform the logical processes shown and described herein.
<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR>Problems Recognized
<BR><BR> As previously mentioned, it is important for network designers, installers, and administrators to know and control the failure modes of an appliance cluster.  Some units allow fail-open and fail-closed option selection, and others provide a
fixed failure mode.  For example, IBM.RTM.  has been designing a series Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) (e.g., G, GX and XGS.RTM.) to fail open or closed based on an unanalyzed frame policy setting when an internal Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) process
crashes or is administratively terminated.  In previous designs of this line of IPS units, for example, the fail open/closed implementation entailed one internal process comprised of one or more driver threads servicing the internal Network Interface
Chip (NIC) and using shared memory queues to communicate with a separate DPI process comprised of one or more threads.  In such an implementation, each driver thread typically runs exclusively on one or more logical cores (lcore) of one or more hardware
processors and can provide the fail open failure mode in the event the IPS process terminates.
<BR><BR> For example, one of the latest IPS product, XGS.RTM., from IBM line uses hardware bypass circuits within the Network Management cards of the IPS, which fail open or closed on a per-port basis.  However, to fully engage the hardware bypass
functionality from the point of a detected failure can take anywhere from one to ten seconds to complete.
<BR><BR> FIGS. 2a and 2b provide a logical diagram and physical network topology, respectively, for a typical high-availability (HA) arrangement of components using an <B><I>Intrusion Prevention System</I></B> (IPS) such as an IBM.RTM.  Proventia XGS.RTM.  IPS. 
Similar logical and physical configurations using other brands or models of IPS are possible, as is well known by those in the art.  Using an administrator panel or tool, such as IBM.RTM.  Proventia.RTM.  Local Management Interface or Site Protector, a
user can manage the HA appliance cluster to configure which ports are monitored and mirrored.  As in the exemplary diagram of FIG. 2a, two physical switches (203, 204) can contain two logical layer 2 switches.  Two separate IPS units (201, 202) share
mirrored ports as well as one cross connected monitored port, such as port 3E on the leftmost IPS (201) and port 1A on the rightmost IPS (202) which are connected to the layer 3 routers (205, 206).  One can see in this diagram two separate paths and
their fail-over options by following the solid network lines and the dashed network lines.
<BR><BR> Referring now to FIG. 2b, an HA physical representation of an appliance cluster is shown corresponding to the logical example of FIG. 2a.  A network (Internet, intranet, etc.) is connected to a pair of routers and firewalls, between which a
fail-over communication path is provided.  The IPS units are serially connected between the firewall units and two switches, which are also cross connected to the server farms.  Those familiar with these arts will find this arrangement typical, except
possibly for the addition of the IPS units.  IPS units in general are also well known among those who use them in their data arrangements.
<BR><BR> With reference to the background discussion of "failing open" and "failing closed" for NIC devices, which are embedded in all of these units (e.g., routers, switches, firewalls, IPS, etc.), network designers, installers and administrators must
be cognizant of all the capabilities and option settings on each unit in order to know and control the expected failure operations of the appliance cluster.
<BR><BR> The inventors have recognized a problem in the art with the advent of UNIX user-space Network Interface drivers, Receive Side Scaling (RSS) and Receive Flow Steering (RFS) capabilities in newer Network Interfaces chipsets in that these IPS
architectures become inferior performance-wise to a Run-To-Completion (RTC) threading model.  In an RTC architecture, each thread/lcore services one or more NIC hardware queues and, for each received frame, calls a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) function. 
There are no lcores dedicated to being a driver thread so more lcores can be used for IPS processing.  There is no intermediate queuing, thus reducing latencies and increasing throughput.  When complete, it drops the frame or Interfaces with the NIC to
transmit the frame.
<BR><BR> However, in an RTC architecture where all threads belong to the same process, if one thread throws a critical exception, the entire process can crash and must be restarted.  During the time of the communication outage, the IPS device fails and
customer networks may be adversely impacted because all traffic is blocked (failed closed).
<BR><BR> The inventors have recognized this as a major flaw with the RTC threading model for which they set out to overcome without compromising performance.
<BR><BR>Terminology and Technology
<BR><BR> In the following description of processes, apparatuses, and computer program products, certain standard and proprietary technologies may be incorporated, coordinated and otherwise combined to yield some of the functionality according to the
invention.
<BR><BR> Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) may comprise one or more processes which provide analysis of data communications packets, their origins, their destinations, and their contents in an attempt to detect an intrusion or attack.
<BR><BR> <B><I>Intrusion Prevention System</I></B> (IPS) may comprise one or more appliance components which are typically micro-processor based with suitable network interface circuitry, and which perform DPI and optionally other types of network threat mitigation
and access functionality, such as the IBM.RTM.  G, GX and XGS units and similar appliances from other vendors and manufacturers.
<BR><BR> Network Interface Chipset (NIC) or Card is a sub-assembly within an appliance such as an IPS, router, firewall, etc., that provides a physical connection to a wired, optical, or wireless data communications network, and which typically includes
processing at one or more of the lower layers of a communication protocol stack such as the OSI seven-layer stack.
<BR><BR> Run-to-Completion (RTC) is a microprocessor task scheduling model in which an executing task, process, or thread has control of the microprocessor until it completes.
<BR><BR> A Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), such as one available from Intel.RTM.  corporation, refers to the software tools, kits, and model programming code that can support an RTC or a pipeline model of processing communications data such as
packetized data.  In the case of the Intel DPDK for the current model of Intel NIC's, there is no scheduler provided by the processor, and it supports any number of cores and processors such as the Intel.RTM.  and Xeon.RTM.  processors Similar NIC
providers offer similar DPDK products to assist developers in using their NIC products in optimal ways.
<BR><BR> Receive Side Scaling (RSS) is a mechanism in which network or transport layers such as Internet Protocol Version 4 or Version 6 receive data processing may be spread across multiple processors and processor cores, as is the case on the NIC's
supplied by Intel.RTM.  corporation.  RSS is supported by a variety of NIC vendors and operating systems, such as various UNIX.RTM.  and UNIX-like (e.g., LINUX, SOLARIS, AIX, etc.) operating systems as well as by Microsoft's Windows.RTM.  operating
system.
<BR><BR> Segmentation Fault (segfault) is a type of access violation in protected memory detected by microprocessing hardware.  An operating system kernel typically initiates a corrective response, such as by sending a signal to the offending process,
thread, or task, or by invoking a particular handler process.
<BR><BR> Embodiments may use any individual or a combination of these technologies, optionally with or without proprietary technologies, as will be evident in the following paragraphs which will utilize the IBM IPS architecture for illustrative purposes
only.
<BR><BR>Overview of the Embodiments
<BR><BR> A first available embodiment utilizes the existing hardware design of an IBM G.RTM., GX.RTM.  or XGS IPS, or a similar IPS system, and provides certain improvements and changes to the device, such as improvements to executable program code,
circuitry, and logic of the IPS unit, to enhance the responsiveness of the fail-over mechanism by reducing the outage time, dedicating all data plane lcores to IPS function and by providing a quicker reconfiguration and restarting of the DPI processes
following a crash.
<BR><BR> An exemplary embodiment employs a NIC DPDK architecture, such as the Intel NIC DPDK, with a RTC thread model which detects an Inline IPS crash.  Within milliseconds instead of tens of seconds, this embodiment has been verified to engage a
processor-performed bypass data plane providing a fail open/close capability using a common set of data plane logical processing cores (lcores) until the IPS process running DPI can be reloaded.  When the DPI threads comprising the IPS data plane have
been successfully restarted, they resume processing of frames and full intrusion detection is in effect.
<BR><BR> This approach avoids the cost and timing delays of the current hardware-based bypass mechanism, and it increases the overall performance of the enhanced IPS products by allowing an RTC threading model while makes the utmost utilization of a
system's resources by not having under-utilized lcores.
<BR><BR>Making a Feature Out of a Limitation
<BR><BR> The present embodiment is particularly novel and nonobvious to those skilled in the relevant arts because a DPDK with Polled Mode Device drivers, such as the Intel.RTM.  NIC DPDK, support primary and secondary process mode operation, but lcores
and network ports cannot be shared across multiple processes according to the relevant manufacturer's Programmer Reference Manual.  The exemplary embodiments disclosed herein, however, overcome this limitation without a performance cost by sharing lcores
and providing mutual exclusivity of use of each process of each lcore and network port.
<BR><BR> When the primary control plane seeks to stop the primary bypass data plane, each thread in the primary bypass data plane is allowed to complete any calls into the DPDK before the process is quiesced.  Likewise, upon failure of the secondary IPS
data plane, all threads except the one which crashed complete their DPDK function calls and then stop.  The thread which crashed will be killed by the OS.  A single lcore will have both a bypass and IPS data plane thread assigned to it with each
belonging to the primary and secondary processes, respectively, but only one will be accessing network queues at any given point in time.
<BR><BR> Sharing the lcores in the manner described in the following paragraphs provides an advantage in that there are no idle lcores at any point in time.  In the present embodiment, a primary process (Process.sup.1) provides a processing-based bypass
capability, and a secondary process (Process.sup.2) provides the full <B><I>Intrusion prevention System</I></B> capability.
<BR><BR>Logical Process Embodiment
<BR><BR> As previously mentioned, modifications or upgrades to the program code stored by and executed by an existing IPS unit hardware platform yields at least one embodiment of the present invention.  Other embodiments include silicon design changes to
NIC's themselves to implement the following logical processes, as well as program code coupled with new or other hardware computing platforms.
<BR><BR> Referring now to FIG. 1a, a primary process control plane running on a lcore, starts (101), reads (102) configuration data defining a pool of lcores, network ports and bypass characteristics from what will become a shared memory pool or pools
(150).  The primary process is responsible for DPDK resource allocation, allocating shared memory pools and bringing up of network ports.  All software/hardware I/O control structures reside in the shared memory pools (150) according to this embodiment. 
It should be noted that a common lcore, 0, will be used as a control plane by both primary and secondary DPDK processes which consumes little central processing unit (CPU) bandwidth to manage.
<BR><BR> The primary process then starts (103) one or more highly simplistic non-DPI receive/transmit threads (151) on the other defined data plane lcores.  At this point the software bypass mechanism is fully engaged as the non-DPI receive/transmit
threads (151) are either simply forwarding packets without inspection (e.g., fails open) or blocking all packets without regard to policy or content of the packets (e.g., failed closed).  This is the bypass data plane.  The bypass data plane will fail
open or closed based on a configurable unanalyzed policy on a port-by port basis.
<BR><BR> The primary process spawns (104) the secondary process, which can be performed by simply copying itself and invoking the copy.  In the former embodiment, the primary and secondary processes are different code images, and in the latter
embodiment, the two processes can be the same code image.
<BR><BR> The secondary process resolves (120) the shared memory pools using the DPDK API's.  The secondary process reads the same configuration data (120) and opens up an IPC channel (121) with the primary process.  Through a defined control plane
protocol which ensures mutual exclusivity of resources, the secondary process is initialized and all IPS threads (152) are readied (122) using the same lcores as the matching primary RxTx threads.  As an example, a given thread in the bypass data plane
running on lcore 5, will provide bypass service for a matching IPS data plane thread also running on lcore 5.  Once the secondary process is ready to take over from the primary process which is processing frames minimally (105) and waiting (106) for the
secondary process, the secondary process notifies (123) the primary process via the IPC channel.  The primary process then relinquishes (107) ownership of the ports once each of its data plane threads returns from any current DPDK function calls and
stops its frame processing duties to become quiescent (108).
<BR><BR> At this juncture, the secondary process containing the IPS data plane has exclusive control of the Rx/TX lcores and network ports and owns all further frame processing responsibilities (152).
<BR><BR> In the event that the secondary process crashes, the secondary process signal handler is called, e.g., SIGSEGV in UNIX implementations.  The handler for such is implemented in the secondary IPS control plane.  Turning now to FIG. 1b, the
secondary process signal handler(s) stops (130) the remaining RxTx threads allowing any current DPDK call to return, and, using the IPC, warns the primary process of the crash.
<BR><BR> When the primary bypass control plane which implements the IPC endpoint receives the notification of secondary IPS data plane termination, it will set a flag indicating that the primary was warned and that the secondary has performed an orderly
stoppage of all IPS data plane threads.
<BR><BR> When the primary process' signal handler (141) runs, e.g., SIGCHLD in UNIX implementations, if (142) the primary process was previously warned, then the primary process immediately engages (109) the receive/transmit bypass fail open or fail
closed capability.  In tests performed on actual implementations, the communication down time is observed to be less than a millisecond for the former, and approximately 1.5 to 2.0 seconds for the latter.  After a configurable delay (110), the primary
process then restarts (102) the secondary IPS process and the processes repeat as previously described.
<BR><BR> If (142) the primary process was not warned of a crash, then it first restarts (102) each of the ports per the configuration and resumes the receive/transmit capability as previously described for the bypass data plane.

servers such as an IBM iSeries.RTM.  server, and portable devices such as personal digital assistants and smart phones, running a popular operating systems (402) such as Microsoft.RTM.  Windows.RTM.  or IBM AIX.RTM., UNIX.RTM., LINUX.RTM., Google.RTM. 
Android.RTM., Apple.RTM.  iOS.RTM., and others, may be employed to execute one or more application programs to accomplish the computerized methods described herein.  Whereas these computing platforms and operating systems are well known and openly
described in any number of textbooks, websites, and public "open" specifications and recommendations, diagrams and further details of these computing systems in general (without the customized logical processes of the present invention) are readily
available to those ordinarily skilled in the art.
<BR><BR> Many such computing platforms, but not all, allow for the addition of or installation of application programs (401) which provide specific logical functionality and which allow the computing platform to be specialized in certain manners to
perform certain jobs, thus rendering the computing platform into a specialized machine.  In some "closed" architectures, this functionality is provided by the manufacturer and may not be modifiable by the end-user.
<BR><BR> The "hardware" portion of a computing platform typically includes one or more processors (404) sometimes accompanied by specialized co-processors or accelerators, such as graphics accelerators, and by suitable computer readable memory devices
(RAM, ROM, disk drives, removable memory cards, etc.).  Depending on the computing platform, one or more network interfaces (405) may be provided, as well as specialty interfaces for specific applications.  If the computing platform is intended to
interact with human users, it is provided with one or more user interface devices (407), such as display(s), keyboards, pointing devices, speakers, etc. Each computing platform requires one or more <B><I>power</I></B> supplies (battery, AC mains, solar, etc.).
<BR><BR>CONCLUSION
<BR><BR> The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention.  As used herein, the singular forms "a", "an" and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as
well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.  It will be further understood that the terms "comprises" and/or "comprising," when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, steps, operations, elements, and/or components,
