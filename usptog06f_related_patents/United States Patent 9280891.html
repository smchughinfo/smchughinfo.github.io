<BR><BR> Returning now to FIG. 1A, it is shown that shock detectors 120 and 122 are deployed adjacent to respective windows 130 and 132 of a residence 134, shock detectors 120 and 122 communicating with system 100 and with alarm system 106.  It is
appreciated that the intrusion thresholds of shock detectors 120 and 122 is tuned so to distinguish between events that justify sounding an alarm, such as a shock wave generated by a thief tampering with respective windows 130 and 132, and of events
which do not justify sounding an alarm, such as a weaker shock wave generated by an animal or by weather conditions such as a thunderstorm.
<BR><BR> As further shown in FIG. 1A, at a first time, such as at 02:00 AM, shock detector 122 deployed adjacent window 132 detects a shock wave originating from the exterior of residence 134 and in proximity to window 132, the shock wave having an
intensity which is lower than the intrusion threshold of shock detector 122.  As shown in stage 1 of FIG. 1A, responsive to detecting the shock wave, shock detector 122 sends a message to system 100 stating that a low-intensity shock wave has been
detected.  It is appreciated that due to the intensity of the detected shock wave being lower than the intrusion threshold of shock detector 122, detector 122 does not notify alarm system 106 of the detected shock wave, and therefore alarm system 106
does not sound an alarm.
<BR><BR> As yet further shown in FIG. 1A, at a second time, such as at 02:05 AM, shock detector 122 deployed adjacent window 132 detects a second shock wave originating from the exterior of residence 134 and in proximity to window 132, the second shock
wave also having an intensity which is lower than the intrusion threshold of shock detector 122.  It is appreciated that alternatively, the second shock wave may be detected by a shock detector deployed adjacent to a second window, such as by shock
detector 120 deployed adjacent window 130.
<BR><BR> As shown in stage 2 of FIG. 1A, responsive to detecting the second shock wave, shock detector 122 sends a second message to system 100 stating that a second low-intensity shock wave has been detected.  It is again appreciated that due to the
intensity of the detected shock wave being lower than the intrusion threshold of shock detector 122, detector 122 does not notify alarm system 106 of the second detected shock wave, and therefore alarm system 106 does not sound an alarm.
<BR><BR> Responsive to receiving the second message from detector 122 regarding the detection of the second low-intensity shock wave, system 100 ascertains that the detection of two consecutive shock waves within a short period of time may potentially be
indicative of an attempted intrusion to the premises, despite both shock waves being of a low intensity.  Therefore, as further shown in stage 3 of FIG. 1A, as a precautionary measure, system 100 automatically instructs both shock detector 120 and shock
detector 122 to lower the intrusion thresholds thereof for a brief period of time, such as for thirty minutes.  Lowering of the intrusion thresholds of detectors 120 and 122 ensures that if yet a third low-intensity shock wave is detected in proximity to
either of windows 130 and 132, the corresponding one of detectors 120 and 122 will instruct alarm system 106 to sound an alarm.
<BR><BR> It is appreciated that the period of time for which system 100 instructs shock detectors 120 and 122 to lower the intrusion thresholds thereof may be unlimited, and that system 100 may instruct shock detectors 120 and 122 to revert intrusion
thresholds thereof to an earlier, higher, setting thereof in the future, for example in response to a future assessment of the probability of an intrusion occurring at residence 134.
<BR><BR> It is a particular feature of this embodiment of the present invention that responsive to detecting an intrusion detection pattern by detector 122, system 100 is operative to tune the intrusion thresholds of detectors 120 and 122 to increase the
security of residence 134 for a predetermined period of time.  It is appreciated that the intrusion detection patterns stored in premises intrusion detection patterns database 112 may also include more complex patterns, such as patterns which comprise
sequences of outputs originating from a multiplicity of detectors.
<BR><BR> FIG. 1C is a simplified flowchart illustrating the aforementioned steps in the operation of automatic intrusion detector threshold control system 100.  As shown in FIG. 1C, a shock detector deployed adjacent to a first window in a residence
detects a first shock wave originating from the exterior of the residence and in proximity to the first window, the shock wave having an intensity which is lower than the intrusion threshold of the first shock detector (150).  Responsive to detecting the
first shock wave, the shock detector sends a message to the automatic intrusion detector threshold control system stating that a low-intensity shock wave has been detected (152).  It is appreciated that due to the low intensity of the detected shock
wave, the shock detector does not notify an alarm system deployed at the residence of the detected shock wave, and therefore the alarm system does not sound an alarm.
<BR><BR> Shortly thereafter, the shock detector detects a second shock wave originating from the exterior of the residence and in proximity to the first window, the second shock wave also having an intensity which is lower than the intrusion threshold of
the shock detector (160).  Responsive to detecting the second shock wave, the shock detector sends a second message to the system stating that a second low-intensity shock wave has been detected (162).  It is again appreciated that due to the low
intensity of the second detected shock wave, the shock detector does not notify the alarm system deployed at the residence of the second detected shock wave, and therefore the alarm system does not sound an alarm.
<BR><BR> Responsive to receiving the second message from the shock detector regarding the detection of the second low-intensity shock wave, the system ascertains that the detection of two consecutive shock waves within a short period of time may be
indicative of an attempted intrusion to the premises, despite both shock waves being of a low intensity (170).  Therefore, as a precautionary measure, the system automatically instructs all shock detectors deployed at the residence to lower the intrusion
threshold thereof for a predetermined period of time (172).  As described hereinabove, lowering of the intrusion thresholds of the shock detectors ensures that if yet a third low-intensity shock wave is detected by a shock detector adjacent to any
windows of the residence, the shock detector will instruct the alarm system to sound an alarm.
<BR><BR> Reference is now made to FIG. 2A, which is a simplified pictorial illustration of the operation of a system for automatically remotely controlling intrusion thresholds of intrusion detectors deployed in a plurality of premises, constructed and
operative in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, to FIGS. 2B & 2C, which are alternative simplified functional block diagrams of the system of FIG. 2A, and to FIG. 2D, which is a simplified flowchart illustration of
steps in the operation of the system of FIGS. 2A-2C.
<BR><BR> FIG. 2A is a pictorial illustration of the operation of the system in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, and will be described hereinbelow with reference to elements of the system as illustrated in FIG. 2B.  The system
of FIG. 2A preferably includes:

intrusion detection patterns, to automatically remotely tune a threshold of at least one intrusion detector deployed in at least a second of the plurality of premises.
<BR><BR> System 200 preferably resides on a computer server connected to a computer network, such as a WAN or the internet, and may be located at any suitable location on the network.  System 200 may alternatively reside in an internet cloud or in a
social server network.
<BR><BR> As shown in particular in FIG. 2B, the automatic intrusion detector threshold remote control system 200 preferably includes central intrusion detector output receiving functionality 202 operative to receive outputs from a plurality of premises
intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 204 each deployed in a corresponding one of a multiplicity of premises 206.  Each of premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 204 is preferably operative to communicate with and to
receive outputs from intrusion detectors 208 deployed in the corresponding one of premises 206.  Intrusion detectors 208 may include, for example, motion detectors, shock detectors and environmental conditions detectors such as heat detectors.
<BR><BR> Intrusion detectors 208 preferably communicate with a premises alarm system 209.  It is appreciated that each of premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 204 may be located within a corresponding one of alarm systems 209 as
shown in alternative functional block diagram 2C.
<BR><BR> System 200 also preferably includes central intrusion detector output comparison functionality 210 operative to compare the outputs received from premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 204 via receiving functionality 202

of premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 204 to tune a threshold of intrusion detectors 208 communicating therewith.
<BR><BR> It is appreciated that, in response to ascertaining, by central intrusion detector output comparison functionality 210, that the output from at least a first of premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 204 matches at least
one of the premises intrusion detection patterns stored in premises intrusion detection patterns database 212, an operator of system 200 may manually employ central intrusion detector threshold remote controlling functionality 214 or any of premises
intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 204 to tune a threshold of intrusion detectors 208 communicating therewith.
<BR><BR> It is also appreciated that each of detectors 208 may also be tuned manually by an operator, either when being initially installed or subsequently thereto, as will be described hereinbelow with regard to FIGS. 4A & 4B.
<BR><BR> Returning now to FIG. 2A, it is shown that vehicle alarm systems 220, 222 and 224 such as alarm system 209 of FIG. 2B, are preferably installed in respective vehicles 230, 232 and 234, vehicles 230, 232 and 234 being located in close proximity
therebetween.  Intrusion detectors 240, 242 and 244 such as intrusion detectors 208 of FIG. 2B are preferably installed in respective ones of vehicles 230, 232 and 234 and preferably communicate with respective alarm systems 220, 222 and 224, notifying
alarm systems 220, 222 and 224 of events which may indicate an intrusion into the vehicle.  Such events may include the detection of shock waves, tampering with or breakage of windows and windshields, and tampering with the ignition mechanism of the
vehicle.  It is appreciated that additional intrusion detectors may also be installed in vehicles 230, 232 and 234.
<BR><BR> Preferably, the intrusion thresholds of intrusion detectors 240, 242 and 244 are tuned so to distinguish between events that justify sounding an alarm, such as a shock wave generated by a thief tampering with a windshield of a corresponding one
of vehicles 230, 232 and 234, and of events which do not justify sounding an alarm, such as a weaker shock wave generated by an animal climbing upon the vehicle.
<BR><BR> Premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 250, 252 and 254, such as premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystem 204 of FIG. 2B, are preferably provided within corresponding vehicles 230, 232 and 234 and
preferably communicate with respective intrusion detectors 240, 242 and 244.  It is appreciated that intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 250, 252 and 254 may be embedded within respective alarm systems 220, 222 and 224 and may communicate
with respective intrusion detectors 240, 242 and 244 either directly or via respective alarm systems 220, 222 and 224.  It is appreciated that communication between alarm systems 220, 222 and 224, respective intrusion detectors 240, 242 and 244 and
respective intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 250, 252 and 254 may be either wired or wireless.
<BR><BR> Premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 250, 252 and 254 preferably remotely communicate with automatic intrusion detector threshold remote control system 200.  It is appreciated that system 200 may be located in a central
security monitoring service which, for example, monitors vehicles and residences which have subscribed to the service and which communicates with alarm systems 220, 222 and 224.  It is also appreciated that communication between system 200 and detector
threshold controlling subsystems 250, 252 and 254 is preferably wireless via, for example, cellular telephone infrastructure.
<BR><BR> As further shown in FIG. 2A, at a first time, such as at 03:00 AM, shock detector 240 installed in vehicle 230 detects a shock wave in proximity to a window of vehicle 230, the shock wave having an intensity which is higher than the intrusion
threshold of shock detector 240, therefore being indicative of an intrusion into vehicle 230.  Responsive to detecting the shock wave, shock detector 240 preferably notifies alarm system 220 of the intrusion, and alarm system 220 preferably sounds an
alarm.  Additionally, shock detector 240 preferably notifies detector threshold controlling subsystem 250 of the intrusion.  It is appreciated that alternatively, alarm system 220 may notify detector threshold controlling subsystem 250 of the intrusion.
<BR><BR> Additionally, responsive to receiving notification of the intrusion, detector threshold controlling subsystem 250 preferably notifies system 200 of the intrusion.  It is appreciated that alternatively, alarm system 220 may notify system 200 of
the intrusion.
<BR><BR> As yet further shown in FIG. 2A, at a second time, such as at 03:10 AM, shock detector 242 installed in vehicle 232 detects a shock wave in proximity to a window of vehicle 232, the shock wave having an intensity which is higher than the
intrusion threshold of shock detector 242, therefore being indicative of an intrusion into vehicle 232.  Responsive to detecting the shock wave, shock detector 242 preferably notifies alarm system 222 of the intrusion, and alarm system 222 preferably
sounds an alarm.  Additionally, shock detector 242 preferably notifies detector threshold controlling subsystem 252 of the intrusion.  It is appreciated that alternatively, alarm system 222 may notify detector threshold controlling subsystem 252 of the
intrusion.
<BR><BR> Responsive to receiving notification of an intrusion of vehicle 232, system 200 ascertains that the detection of two consecutive intrusions into vehicles in the same vicinity within a short period of time may be indicative of a high probability
of imminent additional intrusions into vehicles in the same vicinity.  Therefore, as further shown in FIG. 2A, as a precautionary measure, system 200 automatically instructs detector threshold controlling subsystem 254 located in third vehicle 234 to
lower the intrusion threshold of shock detector 244 communicating therewith for a brief period of time, such as for the remainder of the night, in anticipation of an imminent intrusion into vehicle 234.  Lowering of the intrusion threshold of shock
detector 244 ensures that any attempt at intrusion into vehicle 234 will be detected even if a shock wave generated by such an intrusion is of a low intensity.
<BR><BR> It is appreciated that the period of time for which system 200 instructs shock detector 244 to lower the intrusion thresholds thereof may be unlimited, and that system 200 may instruct shock detector 244 to revert the intrusion threshold thereof
to an earlier setting thereof in the future, for example in response to a future assessment of the probability of an intrusion occurring at vehicle 234.
<BR><BR> It is a particular feature of this embodiment of the present invention that responsive to ascertaining, by system 200, that a pattern of multiple intrusions into premises in a particular vicinity is currently taking place, system 200 is
operative to tune the intrusion thresholds of detectors in additional premises, such as vehicle 234, to thereby increase the security of vehicle 234 for a predetermined period of time.
<BR><BR> FIG. 2D is a simplified flowchart illustrating the aforementioned steps in the operation of automatic intrusion detector threshold remote control system 200.  As shown in FIG. 2D, a shock detector installed in a first vehicle detects a shock
wave in proximity to a window of the vehicle, the shock wave having an intensity which is higher than the intrusion threshold of the shock detector, therefore being indicative of an intrusion into the vehicle (280).  Responsive to detecting the shock
wave, the shock detector preferably notifies a detector threshold controlling subsystem associated therewith of the intrusion (282).  It is appreciated that additionally or alternatively, the shock detector may notify an alarm system associated therewith
of the intrusion and the alarm system may notify the detector threshold controlling subsystem of the intrusion.
<BR><BR> Responsive to receiving notification of the intrusion, the detector threshold controlling subsystem preferably notifies the remote control system of the intrusion (284).  It is appreciated that alternatively, the alarm system associated with the
detector may notify the system of the intrusion.
<BR><BR> Shortly thereafter, a second shock detector installed in a second vehicle located in close vicinity to the first vehicle detects a second shock wave in proximity to a window of the second vehicle, the second shock wave also having an intensity
which is higher than the intrusion threshold of the second shock detector, therefore being indicative of an intrusion into the second vehicle (290).  Responsive to detecting the second shock wave, the second shock detector preferably notifies a second
detector threshold controlling subsystem associated therewith of the intrusion (292).  It is again appreciated that additionally or alternatively, the second shock detector may notify a second alarm system associated therewith of the intrusion and the
second alarm system may notify the detector threshold controlling subsystem of the intrusion.
<BR><BR> Responsive to receiving notification of the intrusion, the second detector threshold controlling subsystem preferably notifies the remote control system of the intrusion (294).  It is appreciated that alternatively, the second alarm system
associated with the second shock detector may notify the system of the intrusion.
<BR><BR> Responsive to receiving notification of an intrusion of the second vehicle, the remote control system ascertains that the detection of two consecutive intrusions into vehicles in the same vicinity within a short period of time may be indicative
of a high probability of imminent additional intrusions into vehicles in the same vicinity occurring (296).  Therefore, as a precautionary measure, the remote control system automatically instructs detector threshold controlling subsystems installed in
additional vehicles located in the vicinity of the first and second vehicles to lower the intrusion threshold of shock detectors communicating therewith for a predetermined period of time, in anticipation of imminent intrusions into additional vehicles
(298).  As described hereinabove, lowering of the intrusion thresholds of shock detectors in the additional vehicles ensures that any attempt at intrusion into the vehicles will be detected even if a shock wave generated by such an intrusion is of a low
intensity.
<BR><BR> Reference is now made to FIG. 3A, which is a simplified pictorial illustration of the operation of a system for automatically remotely controlling intrusion thresholds of intrusion detectors deployed in a plurality of premises, constructed and
operative in accordance with yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention, to FIG. 3B, which is a simplified functional block diagram of the system of FIG. 3A, and to FIG. 3C, which is a simplified flowchart illustration of steps in the
operation of the system of FIGS. 3A & 3B.
<BR><BR> FIG. 3A is a pictorial illustration of the operation of the system in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, and will be described hereinbelow with reference to elements of the system as illustrated in FIG. 3B.  The system
of FIG. 3A preferably includes:
<BR><BR> environmental information receiving functionality operative to receive environmental information pertaining to the environment of at least some of the plurality of premises;
<BR><BR> environmental information comparison functionality operative to compare the environmental information received from the environmental information receiving functionality with a multiplicity of environmental patterns; and
<BR><BR> central intrusion detector threshold remote controlling functionality operative, in response to ascertaining, by the environmental information comparison functionality, that the environmental information received from the environmental
information receiving functionality matches at least one of the multiplicity of environmental patterns, to automatically remotely tune a threshold of at least one intrusion detector deployed in at least one of the some of the plurality of premises.
<BR><BR> System 300 preferably resides on a computer server connected to a computer network, such as a WAN or the internet, and may be located at any suitable location on the network.  System 300 may alternatively reside in an internet cloud or in a
social server network.
<BR><BR> As shown in particular in FIG. 3B, the automatic intrusion detector threshold remote control system 300 preferably includes environmental information receiving functionality 302 operative to receive environmental information pertaining to the
environment of a plurality of premises 304.  It is appreciated that the environmental information pertaining to the environment of premises 304 may include, for example, weather conditions in the environment of premises 304 or law enforcement alerts
regarding the likelihood of intrusions in the area of premises 304.
<BR><BR> Intrusion detectors 306 are preferably deployed in each of premises 304 and preferably communicate with a premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystem 308 and with a premises alarm system 309.  Intrusion detectors 306 may include,
for example, motion detectors, shock detectors and environmental conditions detectors such as heat detectors.  It is appreciated that each of premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 308 may be located within a corresponding one of
alarm systems 309.
<BR><BR> System 300 also preferably includes environmental information comparison functionality 310 operative to compare the environmental information received from environmental information receiving functionality 302 with a multiplicity of
environmental patterns preferably stored in an environmental patterns database 312.
<BR><BR> System 300 also preferably includes central intrusion detector threshold remote controlling functionality 314 operative, in response to ascertaining, by environmental information comparison functionality 310, that the environmental information
received from environmental information receiving functionality 302 matches at least one of the multiplicity of environmental patterns stored in environmental patterns database 312, to automatically instruct at least one of premises intrusion detector
threshold controlling subsystems 308 to tune a threshold of intrusion detectors 306 communicating therewith.
<BR><BR> It is appreciated that, in response to ascertaining, by environmental information comparison functionality 310, that the environmental information received from environmental information receiving functionality 302 matches at least one of the
multiplicity of environmental patterns stored in environmental patterns database 312, an operator of system 300 may manually employ central intrusion detector threshold remote controlling functionality 314 or any of premises intrusion detector threshold
controlling subsystems 308 to tune a threshold of intrusion detectors 306 communicating therewith.
<BR><BR> It is also appreciated that each of detectors 306 may also be tuned manually by an operator, either when being initially installed or subsequently thereto, as will be described hereinbelow with regard to FIGS. 4A & 4B.
<BR><BR> Returning now to FIG. 3A, it is shown that premises alarm systems 320, 322 and 324 such as alarm system 309 of FIG. 3B, are preferably installed in respective premises 330, 332 and 334, premises 330, 332 and 334 being located in close proximity
therebetween.  Intrusion detectors 340, 342 and 344 such as intrusion detectors 306 of FIG. 3B are preferably installed in respective ones of premises 330, 332 and 334 and preferably communicate with respective alarm systems 320, 322 and 324, notifying
alarm systems 320, 322 and 324 of events which may indicate an intrusion into the premises.  Such events may include the detection of shock waves, tampering with or breakage of windows, and tampering with a locking mechanism of the premises.  It is
appreciated that additional intrusion detectors may also be installed at premises 330, 332 and 334.
<BR><BR> Preferably, the intrusion thresholds of intrusion detectors 340, 342 and 344 are tuned so to distinguish between events that justify sounding an alarm, such as a shock wave generated by a thief tampering with a window of a corresponding one of
premises 330, 332 and 334, and of events which do not justify sounding an alarm, such as a weaker shock wave generated by an animal climbing on the premises.
<BR><BR> Premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 350, 352 and 354, such as premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystem 308 of FIG. 3B, are preferably provided within corresponding premises 330, 332 and 334 and
preferably communicate with respective intrusion detectors 340, 342 and 344.  It is appreciated that intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 350, 352 and 354 may be embedded within respective alarm systems 320, 322 and 324, and may
communicate with respective intrusion detectors 340, 342 and 344 either directly or via respective alarm systems 320, 322 and 324.  It is appreciated that communication between alarm systems 320, 322 and 324, respective intrusion detectors 340, 342 and
344 and respective intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 350, 352 and 354 may be either wired or wireless.
<BR><BR> Premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 350, 352 and 354 preferably remotely communicate with automatic intrusion detector threshold remote control system 300.  It is appreciated that system 300 may be located in a central
security monitoring service which, for example, monitors vehicles and residences which have subscribed to the service and which communicates with alarm systems 320, 322 and 324.  It is also appreciated that communication between system 300 and detector
threshold controlling subsystems 350, 352 and 354 may be wired or wireless via, for example, cellular telephone infrastructure or a municipal WiFi network.
<BR><BR> System 300 is operative to receive information regarding weather conditions in the area of premises 330, 332 and 334, as via weather monitoring systems communicating therewith or via weather information service providers.  Responsive receiving
the weather information, system 300 is operative to ascertain that weather conditions in the area of premises 330, 332 and 334 may cause intrusion detectors 340, 342 and 344 to falsely detect an intrusion at a corresponding one of premises 330, 332 and
334.  Such a false detection may be caused, for example, by thunder causing a shock wave to impact a window of a premises.
<BR><BR> Responsive to ascertaining that weather conditions may cause intrusion detectors to falsely detect an intrusion at a premises, system 300, as a precautionary measure, automatically instructs detector threshold controlling subsystems 350, 352 and
354 located in corresponding premises 330, 332 and 334 to raise the intrusion threshold of corresponding intrusion detectors 340, 342 and 344 communicating therewith for a brief period of time, such as for the expected duration of the current weather
conditions.  Raising the intrusion thresholds of intrusion detectors 340, 342 and 344 ensures that shock waves resulting from temporary weather conditions will not cause intrusion detectors 340, 342 and 344 to falsely detect an intrusion to premises 330,
332 and 334.
<BR><BR> It is appreciated that the period of time for which system 300 instructs intrusion detectors 340, 342 and 344 to lower the intrusion thresholds thereof may be unlimited, and that system 300 may instruct intrusion detectors 340, 342 and 344 to
revert the intrusion thresholds thereof to earlier settings thereof in the future, for example in response to changing weather conditions in the vicinity of premises 330, 332 and 334.
<BR><BR> It is further appreciated that responsive to receiving information pertaining to calm weather conditions in the area of premises 330, 332 and 334, system 300 is also operative to automatically instruct detector threshold controlling subsystems
350, 352 and 354 located in corresponding premises 330, 332 and 334 to lower the intrusion threshold of corresponding intrusion detectors 340, 342 and 344 communicating therewith for an expected duration of the calm weather conditions.  Lowering the
intrusion thresholds of intrusion detectors 340, 342 and 344 ensures that shock waves will not be misinterpreted as resulting from weather conditions and will therefore enable intrusion detectors 340, 342 and 344 to more reliably detect intrusions to
premises 330, 332 and 334.
<BR><BR> It is a particular feature of this embodiment of the present invention that responsive to ascertaining, by system 300, that a current weather pattern in a particular vicinity may cause alarm systems in the vicinity to sound false alarms, system
300 is operative to tune the intrusion thresholds of detectors in premises in the vicinity, to thereby reduce the probability of sounding false alarms.
<BR><BR> FIG. 3C is a simplified flowchart illustrating the aforementioned steps in the operation of system 300.  As shown in FIG. 3C, the system initially receives information regarding weather conditions in a particular area (380), as via weather
monitoring systems communicating therewith or via weather infOrmation service providers.  Responsive to receiving the weather information, the system ascertains that weather conditions in the area may cause intrusion detectors installed in premises in
the area to falsely detect intrusions at corresponding premises (382).  Such a false detection may be caused, for example, by thunder causing a shock wave to impact a window of a premises.
<BR><BR> Responsive to ascertaining that weather conditions may cause intrusion detectors to falsely detect an intrusion at a premises, the system, as a precautionary measure, automatically instructs detector threshold controlling subsystems installed in
each of the premises and communicating with corresponding intrusion detectors installed in each of the premises to raise the intrusion threshold of the intrusion detectors communicating therewith for a brief period of time, such as for the expected
duration of the current weather conditions (384).  Raising the intrusion thresholds of the intrusion detectors ensures that shock waves resulting from temporary weather conditions will not cause intrusion detectors to falsely detect an intrusion to
corresponding premises.
<BR><BR> Reference is now made to FIG. 4A, which is a simplified functional block diagram of a shock wave detector of FIGS. 1A-3C, constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.  The shock wave detector of
FIG. 4A is preferably employed as part of the systems of FIGS. 1A-3C, such as intrusion detectors 104, 208 and 306.
<BR><BR> As described hereinabove with reference to FIGS. 1A-3C, intrusion thresholds of intrusion detectors 104, 208 and 306 are operative to be tuned so to distinguish between events that justify sounding an alarm, such as a shock wave generated by a
thief tampering with a window of a premises and of events which do not justify sounding an alarm, such as shock waves generated by weather conditions.  As further described hereinabove, the intrusion threshold of the intrusion detectors may be tuned
either by local intrusion detector threshold controlling functionality such as intrusion detector threshold controlling functionality 114 of FIG. 1B, or by remote\central intrusion detector threshold remote controlling functionality such as premises
intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 204 communicating with central intrusion detector threshold remote controlling functionality 214 of FIG. 2B and premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 308 communicating with
central intrusion detector threshold remote controlling functionality 314 of FIG. 3B.
<BR><BR> Additionally, as further described hereinabove with reference in particular to FIGS. 1B, 2B and 3B, each of detectors 104, 208 and 306 may also be tuned manually by an operator, either when being initially installed or subsequently thereto.
<BR><BR> It is a particular feature of the present invention that the intrusion thresholds of the shock wave detector of FIGS. 4A and 4B is adjusted via a discrete input device such as, for example, a push button, and is preferably displayed on a
discrete type display such as, for example, a seven segment display, an LCD dot matrix display element, a colored LED display element, or an array of LED elements forming a bar display.
<BR><BR> It is further appreciated that discrete enumeration of levels of the intrusion threshold of the shock wave detector of FIGS. 4A and 4B enables tuning the intrusion threshold to a precise numeric value representing one of a plurality of discrete
precalibrated threshold levels.  For example, an operator of an <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> employing the shock wave detector may wish to either manually or remotely adjust the intrusion threshold of the shock wave detector and to test the shock wave
detector at the new threshold, while being able to revert to the precise previous threshold in a case where the new threshold proves to be unsuitable.  It is further appreciated that discrete tuning of the intrusion thresholds of shock wave detectors
such as detectors 104, 208 and 306 is operative to provide uniform tuning of all shock wave detector employed in the systems of FIGS. 1A-3C.
<BR><BR> As shown in FIG. 4A, a shock wave detector 400 comprises a transceiver 402 and a discrete numeric display 404, embodied in the form of a seven-segment display (SSD).  Numeric display 404 is preferably operable to display the intrusion threshold
of shock wave detector 400.  It is appreciated that shock wave detector 400 may be configured to operate over any predetermined discrete numerical range of shock threshold levels.
<BR><BR> Shock wave detector 400 also preferably includes two discrete input actuators 406, each preferably embodied in the form of a pushbutton.  Actuators 406 are operable for manually setting the intrusion threshold of shock wave detector 400 which is
preferably stored in memory 408 of shock wave detector 400.
<BR><BR> It is appreciated that the intrusion threshold of shock wave detector 400 may also be automatically transmitted to shock wave detector 400, via transceiver 402, from remote control functionality such as a household control panel of an <B><I>intrusion
detection system</I></B> which employs shock wave detector 400, intrusion detector threshold controlling functionality 114 of FIG. 1B, premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystems 204 of FIG. 2B and premises intrusion detector threshold
controlling subsystems 308 of FIG. 3B.
<BR><BR> Shock wave detector 400 also preferably includes a microphone 410 for detection of acoustic events which may be indicative of an intrusion, in addition to shock sensing functionality 412.  Shock sensing functionality 412 is preferably operative
to sense shock waves and, additionally, to analyze corresponding acoustic events received by microphone 410 and to employ, inter alia, the intrusion threshold stored in memory 408, to ascertain whether the combination of the sensed shock waves and
corresponding acoustic events are indicative of an intrusion.  Upon ascertaining that the acoustic events are indicative of an intrusion, Detector 400 is preferably operative to transmit an indication of the intrusion to an alarm system communicating
therewith, such as alarm system 106 of FIG. 1B, 209 of FIGS. 2B and 309 of FIG. 3B.
<BR><BR> Detector 400 also preferably includes a LED display 414 for displaying, for example, an indication of an intrusion.  A <B><I>power</I></B> source such as a battery 416 is also preferably provided.  Alternatively, detector 400 may be connected to a wired <B><I>power</I></B>
source.
<BR><BR> Reference is now made to FIG. 4B, which is a simplified pictorial illustration of manual tuning of the intrusion detector of FIG. 4A.  As described hereinabove with reference to FIG. 4A, intrusion detector 400 of FIG. 4A preferably includes two
discrete input actuators 406, each preferably embodied in the form of a pushbutton, which are operable for manually setting the intrusion threshold of intrusion detector 400.
<BR><BR> As shown in step 1 of FIG. 4B, an operator wishing to tune the intrusion threshold of detector 400 of a residence 420 initially generates a relatively weak shock wave emitted by a window 422 by hitting the window with a solid object, such as a
hammer.  The relatively weak shock wave is one which the operator deems as too weak to be indicative of an intrusion of window 422.  The operator notes that the relatively weak shock wave was sensed by shock sensing functionality 412 of detector 400 and
was determined thereby to have an intensity of 22, as displayed on display numeric display 404 of detector 400.
<BR><BR> Thereafter, as shown in step 2 of FIG. 4B, the operator generates a relatively strong shock wave emitted by window 422 by hitting the window with a greater intensity relative to step 1.  The relatively strong shock wave is one which the operator
deems as to be strong enough to be indicative of an intrusion of window 422.  The operator notes that the string weak shock wave was sensed by shock sensing functionality 412 of detector 400 and was determined thereby to have an intensity of 26, as
displayed on display numeric display 404 of detector 400.
<BR><BR> Thereafter, as shown in step 3 of FIG. 4B, responsive to ascertaining that a suitable intrusion threshold for window would be between a threshold which would deem the relatively strong shock wave of step 2 as being indicative of an intrusion of
window 422 while deeming the relatively weak shock wave of step 1 as not being indicative of an intrusion of window 422, the operator employs actuators 406 of detector 400 to set the intrusion threshold of detector 400 as 24.
<BR><BR> It is appreciated that tuning of the intrusion threshold of detector 400 in step 3 of FIG. 4B may also be performed automatically.  For example, responsive to the operator generating a multiplicity of shock waves, each of the shock waves having
a different intensity, detector 400 may calculate an average intensity of the multiplicity of shock waves and tune the intrusion threshold of detector 400 to be the average intensity.  Alternative examples of automatic tuning of detector 400 may include
automatic tuning the intrusion threshold of detector 400 to be a threshold which is higher than the calculated average intensity by a predetermined number of levels, or a threshold which is an average of the three strongest shock waves generated by the
operator.
<BR><BR> It is also appreciated that once tuned, the intrusion threshold of detector 400 may be shared among all intrusion detectors deployed in the residence.  For example, detector 400 may transmit the intrusion threshold thereof to an automatic
intrusion detector threshold control system such as automatic intrusion detector threshold control system 100 of FIGS. 1A & 1B, premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystem 204 of FIGS. 2A & 2B, and premises intrusion detector threshold
controlling subsystem 308 of FIGS. 3A & 3B.  The control system may thereafter transmit the intrusion threshold to all intrusion detectors of residence 420.
<BR><BR> Alternatively, control system 100 may ascertain that the intrusion threshold received from detector 400 is suitable to detect intrusions of window 420, however for other, more vulnerable openings of residence 420, a lower intrusion threshold is
more appropriate.  Similarly, control system 100 may ascertain that for other, less vulnerable openings of residence 420, a higher intrusion threshold is more appropriate.
<BR><BR> It is yet further appreciated that intrusion thresholds of all or some of intrusion detectors deployed in residence 420 may be manually tuned by an operator employing a threshold control system such as automatic intrusion detector threshold
control system 100 of FIGS. 1A & 1B, premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystem 204 of FIGS. 2A & 2B, and premises intrusion detector threshold controlling subsystem 308 of FIGS. 3A & 3B which communicates with all intrusion detectors of
residence 420.  Alternatively, intrusion thresholds of all or some of intrusion detectors deployed in residence 420 may be automatically tuned by the threshold control system as described hereinabove.
<BR><BR> Similarly, it is yet further appreciated that central intrusion detector threshold remote controlling functionality such as central intrusion detector threshold remote controlling functionality 214 of automatic intrusion detector threshold
remote control system 200 of FIGS. 2A & 2B and central intrusion detector threshold remote controlling functionality 314 of automatic intrusion detector threshold remote control system 300 of FIGS. 3A & 3B may be employed to either manually or
automatically tune intrusion thresholds of intrusion detectors deployed in premises communicating therewith.
<BR><BR> It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited by what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove.  Rather the scope of the present invention includes both combinations and
subcombinations of the various features described hereinabove as well as modifications thereof which would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description and which are not in the prior art.
