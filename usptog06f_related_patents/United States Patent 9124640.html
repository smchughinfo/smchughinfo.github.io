       <p> A computing device includes a security control module to monitor and
     control security of the operating system and security of one or more
     applications executing within the operating system. The security control
     module transmits to a remote security server a policy identifier, which
     identifies a security policy that applies to the operating system and to
     the applications. The security control module receives from the remote
     security server a unique cryptographic key. The security control module
     periodically retrieves from the security server a set of commands
     selected by the remote security server according to the security policy
     and current conditions. The security control module executes each
     command. Each command either modifies execution of an executable program
     or process, collects information, or performs an action that modifies
     data associated with the operating system, data associated with the
     security control module, or data associated with the one or more
     applications.

<CENTER><b><i>Description</b></i></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR>TECHNICAL FIELD
<BR><BR> The present application relates generally to systems and methods for imposing scalable security in a cloud computing environment.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR> The tremendous scalability, flexibility, and speed of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) makes it one of the fastest-growing sectors of the cloud computing markets.  IaaS providers combine virtualization technologies with substantial
infrastructure to deliver bandwidth, storage, and processing <B><I>power</I></B> on-demand and with granular control over scale and costs.  The benefits of hosting applications and workloads on cloud servers are enormous, making cloud servers the de facto norm for a
rapidly growing set of use cases.
<BR><BR> Security and compliance, however, remain major challenges to adoption of public cloud infrastructure services.  Usage agreements and documentation squarely make the user of IaaS, not the provider, responsible for protecting servers, applications
and data in the cloud--essentially everything from the virtual machine operating system upward in the stack.
<BR><BR> One challenge to IaaS is that cloud servers attract e-criminals.  Online fraud has grown into a sophisticated underground economy that requires infrastructure on a massive scale.  Phishing, password cracking, and denial of service attacks
leverage botnets.  Botnets are illicit networks built from huge numbers of compromised servers and personal computers.  Botnets consist of thousands of "zombies", personal computers infected by malware, which carry out commands on behalf of the botnet
operator.  These compromised computers can bombard web servers with denial-of-service attacks, fire thousands of password attempts per hour, and participate in dozens of other online cracking activities.
<BR><BR> Fraudsters and e-criminals use command-and-control software to coordinate zombie attack execution.  Command-and-control very frequently operates from compromised servers, without the server owner's knowledge.  Fraudsters demand a constant stream
of freshly compromised servers to keep botnets running.  An entire underground business known as bot herding has emerged to capitalize on this illicit need.
<BR><BR> Bot-herders make their living by building botnets to then sell or rent to other e-criminals.  This practice has evolved to the point of Fraud-as-a-Service, the sale of prebuilt botnets on demand, for a few hundred dollars a month.  It takes bot
herders' time and resources to seek out and compromise vulnerable servers.  Economies of scale and cost-benefit apply to a bot herding business just as any other.  Compromising an elastic cloud infrastructure environment can return a windfall versus
hacking into a traditional hardware server.  If a bot-herder is able to place command-and-control software on a virtual machine that later is duplicated through cloning or cloud bursting, the botnet capacity will automatically grow.  For stakeholders in
cloud hosting environments, the implication is a higher expectation of being targeted for server takeovers, root-kitting and botnet command-and-control insertions.
<BR><BR> An additional security concern for IaaS is that servers have more exposure in the cloud.  More specifically, servers hosted in public IaaS environments have more exposure to compromise than servers do within the traditional data center, where
layers of perimeter controls defend server weaknesses from exploit.  Cloud IaaS environments rarely offer the control over network topology required to implement perimeter security strategies.  As a result, vulnerabilities on each cloud server are more
exposed to compromise than those in a traditional data center.
<BR><BR> In a typical private data center environment, security chokepoints and/or network demarcation zones (DMZs) exist; firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS) and unified threat management devices easily inspect external traffic from sources
such as Internet connectivity.  Typically, hardware acceleration within the data center boosts performance and compensates for the processing demands required to inspect and control all network traffic in and out of an organization.  Because public IaaS
environments rarely offer control over hardware or topology, these control mechanisms are unavailable to enterprises hosting servers there.
<BR><BR> Traditional perimeter security depends heavily on control over network factors like IP addressing, physical topology and routing.  Customers of cloud IaaS have far less of this control; the cloud provider usually dictates network addressing and
routing.  Server IP addresses are unpredictable, creating serious complications in configuring security mechanisms.  Public IaaS environments also typically segment network traffic at the virtual machine level, meaning the only traffic a server can see
is its own.  It is not possible to use network-level intrusion detection systems, <B><I>intrusion prevention system</I></B> or wire-level unified threat management mechanisms in this environment.  The performance implications of each cloud server performing traffic
inspection at the wire level are staggering, especially given the lack of hardware control.  Additionally, the wire-level access to network traffic required of network intrusion detection systems is rarely, if ever, afforded to customers of cloud
servers; in multi-tenant cloud environments, such access is impossible since multiple customers share the same network, and allowing access to operate a network IDS would expose multiple customers' network traffic to capture.
<BR><BR> Even in a traditional data center with perimeter defenses in place, server-level security such as hardening, secure application configuration, and patch management are important.  In the cloud, where front-line defenses are extremely limited,
server-level security protection is important.  Cloud servers are largely on their own to protect themselves.  Strong and highly automated host-based controls that implement all needed capabilities at the host level are important.
<BR><BR> An additional security concern for IaaS is that cloud elasticity multiplies attack surfaces.  Elasticity is a key differentiator distinguishing IaaS from other infrastructure hosting models.  Servers are no longer boxes mounted to racks bolted
to the floor.  With virtualization and cloud technologies, servers are now files and metadata that can be instantly copied, migrated, and stored offline for later reactivation.  Uncontrolled copies of virtual servers and their content can be maliciously
or accidentally created nearly instantly; such copies can easily be re-activated in environments also uncontrolled by the server owner.  Therefore, only security that is implemented within (and therefore is copied and moves with) a virtual computer is
able to protect that virtual computer without regard for its operating location.
<BR><BR> Cloud elasticity provides companies with the ability to cloudburst, expanding the number of servers and available computer <B><I>power</I></B> within minutes.  However, this significantly increases the risk of compromise.  The problem is quite simply that as
a virtual server duplicates so do its vulnerabilities and exposures.  Given the speed with which servers can multiply, this issue can increase the attackable surface area of a cloud server farm dramatically within minutes.
<BR><BR> Inactive machine images or snapshots are virtual machines that are saved for later reactivation or as a template for new servers.  While this capability is clearly useful, offline server images, being inactive, do not get updates regarding newly
discovered vulnerabilities, policy changes, or modification to user accounts and access rights.  When a hibernated server is reactivated, there will be access privileges, software vulnerabilities, and outdated configurations that expose it to immediate
compromise.
<BR><BR> When adopting a cloud-hosting model, system administrators and other stakeholders should be aware of and account for these issues.  One incorrectly configured server, either created recently or resurrected from storage, could multiply during
cloning and cloud-bursting operations to become the "typhoid Mary" of the cloud farm.
<BR><BR> Another challenge to IaaS arises during development of application code in cloud hosting environments.  Many organizations, like small businesses and autonomously-operating business units, turn to cloud hosting for application development Public
cloud hosting reduces barriers to application development, increasing speed to market for technology related products.  Special infrastructure skills, network configuration and hardware setup time are minimal.  This is an attractive proposition,
especially for business and technology managers frustrated with real or perceived delays and "red tape" associated with infrastructure setup.  Sometimes central information technology organizations sanction cloud-based development efforts; in some
instances, individual business units charge ahead independently.  At some point, all successful development projects go into production.  Sometimes the application continues to run in the public cloud environment.  Often the application code comes back
in-house with the cloud server in a ready-to-run virtual machine image.
<BR><BR> If cloud servers used for development are not secured properly, undesired results may occur.  These servers are highly exposed, and often the dynamic nature of application development masks signs of intrusion.  Compromise impact could include
code theft or insertion of malicious functionality into the new application.  Any live data used for development purposes, a poor but disturbingly frequent practice, could be at risk and compromised with the server.  If rootkits or other malware are
dropped onto the cloud server, that malware could come back to the enterprise data center, making a cloud server into a powerful and dangerous Trojan horse.
<BR><BR> As the above background details, clearly there is a new set of exposures and risks associated with hosting applications, data and workloads in public IaaS environments.  Existing technologies that secure computers are not adequate at addressing
such exposures.  For instance, hardware based security devices cannot be used by a virtual machine, because virtual machine owners have no ability to deploy hardware.  In many public cloud infrastructure hosting environments, the owner of the virtual
machine has absolutely no control over hardware in any manner.  Server security strategies that depend on creating network perimeter controls are also inadequate because virtual machine owners do not have enough control over the networking environment to
implement perimeters.  Server security strategies that focus on putting security controls at the host level (host-based security) are also ineffective because existing host-based security technologies almost exclusively perform computation on the
computer being protected, which consumes large amounts of computing, storage and other resources on each individual computer.  Placing multiple host-based security technologies on a single virtual machine would cause untenable levels of resource
consumption on that computer, rendering it unsatisfactory at performing its actual computing function.
<BR><BR> The issues above make it clear that improvements in server security management are needed; specifically creation of an elastic security management capability for virtual machines that does not impact the performance of the virtual machine being
protected and is able to implement security controls that move with the virtual machine.  Conventional perimeter-oriented methods of protection that have worked for years are highly problematic or completely untenable in these environments.  The dynamic
nature of public and hybrid cloud server farms further complicates matters.  The lack of options to protect servers in high-risk public clouds can impede companies from embracing public IaaS and thereby realizing the benefits of IaaS.  Thus, there is a
need in the art for security measures that secure IaaS servers in an automated, portable, and elastic manner.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR> The present disclosure provides security measures that secure virtual computers, especially those in virtualized or cloud-computing (IaaS) environments in an automated, portable, and elastic manner.  The present disclosure addresses the needs in
the art by making novel use of a system including an agent executive that operates within a virtual machine that securely interoperates with a remote grid computer system specifically optimized for security computation.  The aforementioned system
provides for security, compliance and integrity of virtual machines by providing related management and automation functions, non-limiting examples of which include virtual machine firewall management, software vulnerability detection, configuration
compliance monitoring, system integrity monitoring, detection of intrusion attempts and proactive intervention to prevent intrusion attempts and/or correct vulnerable virtual machine states.
<BR><BR> The system depicted in this disclosure provides for dramatic advances in the art, specifically in the methods by which such security, compliance and integrity management functions can be automatically monitored, maintained and managed centrally
in a manner that can scale from few to many virtual machines; in the capability to automatically and securely provision and de-provision virtual machines that are cloned, suspended, re-activated and/or moved frequently and in large numbers; in the
capability to centrally manage virtual computers that are operating concurrently in a plurality of data centers, collocation providers, cloud hosting providers, and/or Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers; and in the capability to implement
secure, reliable communication of management capabilities that can operate in and across untrustworthy or hostile networking and hosting environments.
<BR><BR> The fundamental operation of the system includes the initialization of the agent executive upon first execution; an initial and ongoing process to verify the agent executive integrity; and an ongoing cycle in which the agent executive retrieves
commands from the remote grid computer system, executes those commands, returns information to the remote grid computer as needed, and the analysis of returned information by the remote grid computer.  Based on the remote grid computer's analysis of
information retrieved from the agent, additional commands may be issued to the agent executive to implement needed changes to the virtual computer on which the agent operates.  Additionally, the agent executive may autonomously perform scheduled actions
that are independent from the remote grid computer.
<BR><BR> When first executed, the new agent executive must be initialized.  The agent executive acquires an API key from a user or by automated means.  The agent executive communicates this API key to a remote grid computer system, which creates and
assigns a new unique agent identity token using a cryptographic token generation protocol that generates agent identity tokens.  The remote grid computer system provides the agent executive with the agent identity token.  Thereafter, the agent executive
and the remote grid computer system are able to create and consume messages to and from one another in a secure manner, using the agent identity token and corollary grid identity material to mutually encrypt, decrypt, sign, authenticate and verify
message contents, non-limiting examples of which include status information, command, and data collected from the virtual machine.
<BR><BR> Once the new agent executive is initialized and the integrity of the agent executive is assured, it can be used to collect information specified by the grid computer system to retrieve many types of security-oriented technical information
related to any program, data structure, process, or status associated with the virtual machine.  To this end, the agent executive collects commands that perform such checks based on messages retrieved from a command queue that is hosted by the grid
computer system and is uniquely associated with the agent executive.  The agent executive performs the commands issued by the grid computer system and returns a result status and/or requested information about the virtual machine to the grid computer
system.
<BR><BR> The grid computer system, upon receiving the result status and/or requested information, performs analysis of the status and/or information against sets of rules associated with the virtual machine, but not accessible to the virtual machine, in
order to evaluate the security, compliance and integrity of any program, data structure, process, or status associated with the virtual machine.  In addition, the grid computer system may issue commands to the agent executive to modify configuration
parameters on the virtual machine on which the agent executive operates; such commands would implement protective or reactive modifications to elements directly composing or resident upon the virtual machine, non-limiting examples of which include
processes, network services, user accounts and privileges, operating system configuration, application configurations, firewall rules, files, directories, active sessions, log information, and installed software and/or utilities.
<BR><BR> Of particular note, the grid computer system does not send these commands directly to the agent executive.  Rather, the agent executive reads the commands from a command queue located on the remote grid computer at predetermined intervals and
executes the commands once read from the command queue.  In this way, the security and integrity of the agent executive is strongly protected from unauthorized access or operational disruption even in an unsecure environment, since no externally
accessible network port or service is available on the agent executive to which a potentially detrimental or malicious entity or process might connect and potentially compromise the agent executive's operation.
<BR><BR> One type of command set that may be used imposes an operating system security configuration policy for a virtual machine.  In this example, the grid computer system issues commands to the agent executive periodically (e.g., every minute, every
five minutes, every ten minutes, each hour, each day, etc.) or on some other predetermined basis (e.g., by a schedule) or non-predetermined basis (e.g., by an ad-hoc instruction from the operator) that instructs the agent executive to collect information
from the virtual machine that relates to the security of the virtual machine, non-limiting examples of such information including file system permissions, process ownership, open network ports, bindings of processes to network services, user privileges,
password strength, configuration settings, installed software, log entries, firewall rules, presence of security controls, and presence of certain data types such as credit-card numbers.  The agent executive collects these commands from the command
queue, executes the commands to collect needed information, and securely returns this information to the grid computer system.
<BR><BR> The grid computer system verifies the authenticity and integrity of the data using cryptographic means, subsequently analyzing the information collected using rules stored on the grid computer system to evaluate the state of security, compliance
and integrity of the virtual machine.  If the grid computer system determines there is a state of vulnerability or non-compliance on the virtual computer, the grid computer system posts corrective action, in the form of commands to the command queue
uniquely associated with the agent executive.  The agent executive securely retrieves and then performs these commands and returns the success or failure state to the grid computer system.  Based on this state, the grid computer system may take
additional steps to remediate a state of vulnerability or non-compliance, up to termination of the virtual machine to absolutely prevent potential compromise.
<BR><BR> This process of reading commands and returning information to the grid computer system in order to evaluate and, as needed, remediate virtual computer compliance, security and integrity repeats itself to provide ongoing protection and compliance
of the virtual machine.  The present disclosure provides additional embodiments for ensuring security in instances where virtual machines are cloned and instances where previously run virtual machines have been restarted after an arbitrary period of
inactivity.
<BR><BR> First Embodiment, from Point of View of a Server Hosting a Virtual Machine Running an Agent Executive.
<BR><BR> In this exemplary first embodiment, a server computer system comprises one or more processing units and a memory coupled to at least one of the one or more processing units.  The memory stores a virtual machine.  An agent executive runs within
the virtual machine.  The agent executive is executed by at least one of the one or more processing units and comprises instructions for obtaining an agent API key from a user when the agent executive is executed a first time.  The agent executive
further comprises instructions for communicating the API key to a remote grid computer system in a first part of a synchronous process.  The agent executive receives, in a second part of the synchronous process and responsive to the first part of the
synchronous process, an agent identity token from the remote grid computer system.  The remote grid computer system generates the agent identity token through a cryptographic token generation protocol.  The agent executive stores the agent identity token
in a secure data store associated with the agent executive.  The agent executive collects information on the server computer system for an evaluation of security, compliance and integrity of the agent executive using a plurality of agent
self-verification factors.  The agent executive, as identified by the agent identity token, encrypts the information for confidentially.  The agent executive also digitally signs the information for integrity and authenticity prior to communicating the
information to the remote grid computer system as part of an asynchronous process.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the agent executive further comprises instructions for querying a command queue on the remote grid computer system, as part of an asynchronous process, for one or more commands, where the command queue is accessed based upon
an identity of the agent identity token.  Once retrieved, the commands are executed by the agent executive.  The commands are encrypted for confidentially and digitally signed for integrity and authenticity before transit.  In some instances, a command
in the one or more commands is a firewall policy for the virtual machine, a corrective or proactively protective action, a request to recollect the information on the server computer system for an evaluation of integrity of the agent executive using a
plurality of agent self-verification factors, or a request to terminate the virtual machine.  In some instances, the one or more commands comprise a command set for checking a status of a data structure accessible to the virtual machine or for checking a
status of a process running on the virtual machine.  In some instances, the one or more commands comprise a command set for checking the status of a setting associated with a file stored in a memory accessible to the virtual machine, a setting of a
directory stored in a memory accessible to the virtual machine, or an existence or a status of a process running on the virtual machine.  In some instances, the one or more commands comprise a command set for checking a password associated with a user or
with a group of users of the virtual machine, for validation of a name-value pair in a file in a memory accessible by the virtual machine, or for checking a status of a network communication port that is associated with the virtual machine.
<BR><BR> Second Embodiment, from the Perspective of a Grid Computer System in which the Agent Executive has No Preexisting Agent Identity Token.
<BR><BR> In this exemplary second embodiment, a grid computer system comprises one or more processing units and a memory, coupled to at least one of the one or more processing units.  The memory stores a grid node that is executed by at least one of the
one or more processing units.  The grid node comprises instructions for receiving, in a first part of a synchronous process, an API key from an agent executive running on a virtual machine which, in turn, is running on a computer that is remote to the
grid computer system.  The grid node determines, in a second part of the synchronous process, whether the API key is a valid API key.  The grid node generates, in a third part of the synchronous process, an agent identity token through a cryptographic
token generation protocol key when the API key is deemed valid.  The grid node communicates, in a fourth part of the synchronous process and responsive to the first part of the synchronous process, the agent identity token to the virtual machine running
on the remote computer.  The grid node receives encrypted and digitally signed information from the virtual machine from an evaluation of the integrity of the agent executive based upon a plurality of agent self-verification factors.  This receiving
comprises decrypting the information using the agent identity token to form decrypted information and verifying the signature used to sign the received information.  The grid node verifies the integrity of the agent executive based on the decrypted
information.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the grid node creates, as a function of the agent identity token, a command queue on the grid computer system, where the command queue is unique to the agent executive.  Then the grid node posts to the command queue one or
more commands to be executed by the agent executive.  These one or more commands can be, for example, any of the commands or command sets described above in the first embodiment.
<BR><BR> Third Embodiment, from the Point of View of a Grid Computer System in which the Agent Executive has a Preexisting Agent Identity Token.
<BR><BR> In this exemplary third embodiment, a grid computer system comprises one or more processing units and a memory, coupled to at least one of the one or more processing units.  The memory stores a grid node.  The grid node is executed by at least
one of the one or more processing units.  The grid node comprises instructions for receiving an alert from a first agent executive running on a first virtual machine running on a computer that is remote to the grid computer system.  The alert comprises
(i) an indication that the first agent executive has started running on the first virtual machine and (ii) a first agent identity token associated with the first agent executive.  The grid node determines whether the first agent identity token is valid. 
The grid node also determines whether the first agent identity token is being used by a second agent executive running on a second virtual machine.  The grid node generates a second agent identity token through a cryptographic token generation protocol
when (i) the first agent identity token is valid but is being used by a second agent executive running on a second virtual machine.  Once created, the second agent identity token is communicated to the first virtual machine.  Thereafter, the grid node
receives encrypted and digitally signed information from the first virtual machine from an evaluation of the integrity of the first agent executive based upon a plurality of agent self-verification factors.  The grid node decrypts the encrypted
information in order to form decrypted information and verifies the signature.  Then the grid node determines the integrity of the first agent executive based on the decrypted information.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the grid node further comprises instructions for creating, as a function of the second agent identity token, a command queue on the grid computer system, where the command queue is unique to the first agent executive.  The
grid node posts one or more commands to be executed by the first agent executive to this command queue.  These one or more commands can be, for example, any of the commands or command sets described above in the first embodiment.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the grid node applies the information received from the first agent executive against one or more rules stored on the grid computer system.  When such a rule fails, the grid node, in some instances, posts a corrective or
proactively protective action to the command queue on the grid computer system that is uniquely associated with the first agent executive.
<BR><BR> Computer Program Product Embodiments.
<BR><BR> The present disclosure further provides computer program product embodiments that incorporate the instructions of any of the embodiments described above into a computer program product for use in conjunction with a computer system.  Such
computer program products comprise a tangible computer readable storage medium and a computer program mechanism embedded therein.  The computer program mechanism comprises the instructions of any of the embodiments described above. <BR><BR>BRIEF

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR> A detailed description of a system in accordance with the present disclosure is described in conjunction with FIG. 1A.  As such, FIGS. 1A and 1B collectively illustrate the topology of an environment in accordance with the present disclosure. 
In the topology, there is a server computer 100 (FIG. 1A) and a grid computer system 200 (FIG. 1B).  Of course, other topologies are possible, for instance, grid computer system 200 can in fact be formed from several computers that are linked together in
a network.  Further, there may be any number of server computers like that of the server computer 100 and functioning in the same manner as the server computer 100, where each such server computer is serviced by the grid computer system 200.  Moreover,
typically, there are hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of server computers 100 or more.  The exemplary topology shown in FIGS. 1A-1B merely serves to describe the features of an embodiment of the present disclosure in a manner that will be
readily understood to one of skill in the art.
<BR><BR> The server computer 100 will typically have one or more processing units (CPU's) 2, a network or other communications interface 10, a memory 14 (e.g., random access memory), one or more magnetic disk storage and/or persistent devices 20
optionally accessed by one or more controllers 18, one or more communication busses 12 for interconnecting the aforementioned components, and a <B><I>power</I></B> supply 24 for powering the aforementioned components.  Data in memory 14 can be seamlessly shared with
non-volatile memory 20 using known computing techniques such as caching.  Memory 14 and/or memory 20 can include mass storage that is remotely located with respect to the central processing unit(s) 2.  In other words, some data stored in memory 14 and/or
memory 20 may in fact be hosted on computers that are external to the secure interface server 180 but that can be electronically accessed by the server computer 100 over an Internet, intranet, or other form of network or electronic cable (illustrated as
element 26 in FIG. 1A) using network interface 10.
<BR><BR> Memory 14 preferably stores a hypervisor 40 for initiating hardware virtual machines 42 and one or more hardware virtual machines 42.  There may be any number of hardware virtual machines 42 running on the server computer 100.  In some
instances, there is only one hardware virtual machine 42 running on the server computer 100.  In some instances, there are two or more, three or more, five or more, or ten or more hardware virtual machines 42 running on the server computer 100.  In some
instances, a single virtual machine 42 is running on multiple server computers 100.  Each hardware virtual machines 42 preferably comprises: an operating system 44 that includes procedures for handling various basic system services; an agent controller
46 that is always running when the virtual machine 42 is running, the agent controller serving to ensure that an agent executive 48 is running on the virtual machine 42; where the agent executive 48 provides security in a cloud computing environment.
<BR><BR> In preferred embodiments, each agent executive 48 comprises: a grid communication module 50 that is used for communicating with the grid computer system 200 via one or more communication networks 26, such as the Internet, other wide area
networks, local area networks (e.g., a local wireless network can connect the server computer 100 to the grid computer system 200), metropolitan area networks, and so on; and an agent data store 52 or instructions for accessing an agent data store 52,
the agent data store 52 storing factors 68 for verification, commands 58, and other data that is used to provide security for virtual computers in a cloud computing environment.
<BR><BR> In preferred embodiments, the agent data store 52 stores: an agent identity token 56 that is uniquely associated with the agent executive 48; one or more command sets 58, each command set 58 comprising one or more commands 66 that are run by the
agent executive 48; sweep results 64 that are collected by agent executive 48 in response to commands 66 and/or agent self-verification factors 68; and agent self-verification factors 68 that are used to verify the integrity of the corresponding agent
executive 48.
<BR><BR> Memory 14 further comprises shared knowledge 62 that is shared with grid computer system 200, the shared knowledge serving to encrypt, decrypt, digitally sign and/or verify data and messages that are communicated between the server computer 100
and the grid computer system 200 as disclosed in further detail below.  Direct communication from the remote grid computer system 200 to the agent executive 48 is not possible because agent executive 48 cannot accept a network connection from any device
anywhere.  Agent executive 48 has no open network communication ports.
<BR><BR> The operating system 44 within each virtual machine 42 also runs one or more user applications 70, such as the first application 70-1 and the second application 70-2 illustrated in FIG. 1A.  In some embodiments, one or more of the applications
70 are applications in development.
<BR><BR> Although not stored in agent data store 52 or anywhere else on computer 100, there is an agent API key that is uniquely associated with an organization that controls a respective agent executive 48 or with a policy domain when a single
organization desires to implement multiple policy domains, each of which is intended to control a distinct set of one or more agent executives 48.
<BR><BR> As will be understood by one of skill in the art, there is individual persistent storage (e.g. of type 20) associated 1:1 with each virtual machine 42 residing on server 100.  Such storage is where the virtual machine 42 operating systems and
files are stored and accessed, and in turn is where the agent binaries and encrypted databases (e.g., agent data store 52) are stored and accessed.
<BR><BR> In operation, agent data store 52 is stored in memory 20, although some agent data is held in memory 14 of the virtual computer during operation.
<BR><BR> One or more server computers 100 are able to establish a connection via Internet/network to grid computer system 200.  FIG. 1A illustrates the connection to only one such server computer 100.  In typical embodiments, a grid computer system 200
comprises one or more computers.  For purposes of illustration in FIG. 1B, the grid computer system 200 is represented as a single computer that includes all of the functionality of the grid computer system 200.  However, the disclosure is not so
limited.  The functionality of the grid computer system 200 may be spread across any number of networked computers and/or reside on each of several networked computers.  One of skill in the art will appreciate that a wide array of different computer
topologies are possible for the grid computer system 200 and all such topologies are within the scope of the present invention.  Turning to FIG. 1B with the foregoing in mind, an exemplary grid computer system 200 comprises: one or more processing units
(CPU's) 102; a network or other communications interface 104; a memory 114; optionally, one or more magnetic disk storage and/or persistent storage devices 120 accessed by one or more optional controllers 118; a user interface 106, the user interface 106
including a display 108 and a keyboard or keypad or other data entry device 110; one or more communication busses 112 for interconnecting the aforementioned components; and a <B><I>power</I></B> supply 124 for powering the aforementioned components.
<BR><BR> It will be appreciated that in typical embodiments, user interface 106, display 108, and other data entry devices 110 are not part of a grid computer system.  In fact, in typical embodiments, the grid computer system is a virtual machine itself.
<BR><BR> In some instances, data in memory 114 can be seamlessly shared with optional non-volatile memory 120 using known computing techniques such as caching.
<BR><BR> The memory 114 preferably stores: an operating system 140 that includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks; and a grid node 142 for providing security in a cloud computing
environment.
<BR><BR> Typically, a grid node 142 comprises: an agent identity token generator 144 for generating an agent identity token 56 using a cryptographic token generation protocol when an agent API key provided by an agent executive 48 is deemed valid.  The
agent identity token generator 144 is sometimes referred to as the token generation module; shared knowledge 62 for each of one or more agent executives 48 running on one or more remote server computers 100, such shared knowledge enabling encryption of
information that is exchanged between the agent executives 48 and the grid computer system 200; an agent communication module 148 that is used to communicate commands to one or more virtual machines 42 running on one or more remote server computers 100,
the agent communication module 148 including a command queue 150 for each such virtual machine 42, whereby the agent communication module 148 posts commands for a respective agent executive 48 to the command queue 150 that uniquely corresponds to the
virtual machine 42 on which the respective agent executive 48 runs; a policy domain 152 comprising one or more command sets 58 and one or more rule sets 59, where for each command set 58 there is a corresponding rule set 59, each command set 58 including
one or more commands, where each such command directs an agent executive 48 to acquire information or perform a task and report back to the grid computer system 200 the status of the task and where each rule set 59 is for processing information provided
by an agent executive 48 to the grid computer system 200 upon completion of a corresponding command set 58; a server scan module 158 which collects information and/or the status of completed tasks upon completion of a command set 58 and stores such data
as sweep results 64, each such sweep result uniquely corresponding to a hardware virtual machine 42 serviced by the grid computer system 200.  The server scan module 158 is sometimes referred to as the integrity validation module; and an agent
self-verification module 160 which keeps an up-to-date list of the agent self-verification factors 68 that are used to verify an agent executive 48 running on each virtual machine 42 serviced by the grid computer system 200 as well as rules 180 for
processing these factors.
<BR><BR> Agent self-verification module 160 comprises agent self-verification corrective command sets and agent self-verification failsafe commands in addition to agent self verification factors 68.  Agent self-verification corrective command sets and
agent self-verification failsafe command sets comprise the actual commands used to attempt correct an integrity failure, and in the event that self-correction fails, the failsafe actions to be taken (e.g., alert an administrator, shut down the agent
executive 48, shut down the virtual machine 42, etc.).
<BR><BR> The agent identity token 56 is uniquely associated with an agent executive 48.  As disclosed below, the agent identity token 56 is the data by which the uniquely associated agent executive 48 is identified and authenticated to the grid computer
system 200.  The agent identity token 56 along with shared knowledge 62 is used (i) by the grid communication module 50 to encrypt and sign any message sent to the grid computer system 200, (ii) the agent communication module 148 to decrypt, authenticate
the sender of, and verify the integrity of any message received from an agent executive 48, (iii) the agent communication module 148 encrypting and signing any message to an individual agent executive 48; and (iv) the grid communication module 50 to
decrypt, authenticate the sender of, and verify the integrity of any message received from the grid computer system 200.
<BR><BR> Initiation of a Hypervisor 40, an Agent Controller 46, and an Agent executive 48 on a server computer 100.
<BR><BR> FIG. 2 illustrates how a server computer 100 is initiated in accordance with a first embodiment of the present disclosure.
<BR><BR> Block 202.
<BR><BR> In block 202, the hypervisor 40 initiates a virtual machine 42 on the server computer 100 and an operating system 44 is initiated within the initiated virtual machine 42.  The hypervisor 40, also called a virtual machine manager (VMM), is any
one of many hardware virtualization techniques that allow multiple operating systems 44 to run concurrently on the server computer 100.  The hypervisor 40 presents to each of the guest operating systems 44 a virtual operating platform and manages the
execution of such operating systems.  Multiple instances of a variety of operating systems 44 may share the virtualized hardware resources.  Commercial embodiments of the hypervisor 40 include, but are not limited to, OPENSTACK, EUCALYPTUS, VMWARE ESXI,
CITRIX XENSERVER, MICROSOFT HYPER-V HYPERVISOR, SUN'S LOGICAL DOMAINS HYPERVISOR, and HP's INTEGRITY VIRTUAL MACHINES.  Examples of operating systems 44 include, but are not limited to UNIX, OPEN VMS, LINUX, and MICROSOFT WINDOWS.
<BR><BR> Block 204.
<BR><BR> Once the operating system 44 is running on a virtual machine 42, an agent controller 46 is initiated.  The agent controller's primary responsibility is to ensure that an agent executive 48 is running on the virtual machine 42 at all times. 
Thus, in block 204, the agent controller 46 initiates the agent executive 48 on the hardware virtual machine 42.
<BR><BR> Block 206.
<BR><BR> In block 206, a determination is made by the agent executive 48 as to whether it already has an agent identity token 56 assigned to it.  In some instances, an agent executive 48 may already have an agent identity token assigned to it if the
virtual machine 42 corresponding to the agent executive 48 had been running before and had stopped running, because of a <B><I>power</I></B> outage or computer hardware failure for example, but is now once again running.  In some instances, an agent executive 48 may
already have an agent identity token 56 assigned to it if the virtual machine 42 corresponding to the agent executive 48 is a cloned copy of another virtual machine 42 that is also running.  If the agent executive 48 does not have agent identity token 56
(206--No), then process control passes to block 302 of FIG. 3A, which describes how an API key is obtained.  If the agent executive 48 does have an agent identity token 56 (206--Yes), then process control passes to block 208.
<BR><BR> Block 208.
<BR><BR> In block 208, the agent executive 48 begins a synchronous process in which it notifies the grid computer system 200 that the agent executive 48 has been initiated by the agent controller 46.  Further, as part of this synchronous process, the
agent executive 48 communicates the agent identity token 56 to the grid computing system 200.
<BR><BR> Block 210.
<BR><BR> In block 210, the grid computer system 200 receives the agent identity token 56 from the server computer 100 and determines whether it is valid.  This is done by checking the agent identity token 56 against a list of such tokens that is
maintained by the grid computer system 200 in memory 114 and/or memory 120 or that is otherwise accessible to the grid computer system 200.  If validation is successful in block 210 (210--Yes), process control passes to block 212.  If validation is not
successful in block 210 (210--No), the agent executive 48 is notified of this failure and process control passes to block 211.
<BR><BR> Block 211.
<BR><BR> In block 211, a synchronous instruction is sent from the grid computer system 200 to the agent executive 48 to shut it down.  Optionally, an alert is sent to the user to advise that there was an attempt to utilize an invalid agent identity token
56.
<BR><BR> Block 212.
<BR><BR> Block 212 is reached if agent executive 48 is operating with a valid agent identity token 56.  Block 212 is necessary to accommodate cloud bursting in which multiple virtual machines 42, termed children virtual machines, are concurrently
executed, where each such child virtual machine 42 is based upon a common parent virtual machine 42 that may still be executing or that may be an inactive virtual machine image upon which agent executive 48 has been previously installed and configured. 
Such cloud bursting processes have the benefit of providing dynamic servicing of loads that vary in computational intensity over time.  For instance, in some embodiments, the parent virtual machine 42 hosts one or more retail modules (not shown in FIG.
1A) that service retail transactions over the Internet.  During times of peak demand, such as for sales or during the holidays, the demand on the one or more retail modules increases.  To service such demand, multiple children virtual machines 42 may
each be generated based on the already implemented parent virtual machine 42.  In such instances, each child virtual machine 42 will initially have the same agent identity token 56.  In order to uniquely identify and provide adequate security to each of
the child virtual machines 42, each such child virtual machine 42 is provided with new a unique agent identity token 56.  Thus, if a determination is made that agent identity token 56-1 is a duplicate of an already active agent identity token (one that
is being used by an another activated agent executive 48) (212--Yes), then process control passes to block 320 of FIG. 3B.  If a determination is made that agent identity token 56-1 is not a duplicate of an already active agent identity token (212--No),
then the determination is made that this executive agent 48 is associated with a previously deactivated virtual machine 42 that has been re-activated and process control passes either to block 409 (FIG. 4C) in order to self-verify the virtual machine 42
or, if the agent executive of the virtual machine is already validated, to step 502 (FIG. 5) to begin a sweep.
<BR><BR> Processes by which an Agent Executive can Acquire a Unique Agent Identity Token in Accordance with the Present Disclosure.
<BR><BR> FIG. 3 illustrates processes by which agent identity tokens 56 are generated in accordance with the present disclosure.  A first process, exemplified by blocks 302 through 308 in FIG. 3A, is used when an agent executive 48 does not have an agent
identity token 56 (206--No).  A second process, exemplified by blocks 320 through 324 in FIG. 3B, is used when a first agent executive 48 has an agent identity token 56 but the agent identity token is already being used by an active virtual machine 42
that was initiated before the virtual machine 42 associated with the first agent executive 48 was executed (212--Yes).
<BR><BR> Block 302.
<BR><BR> Agent executive 48 does not have an agent identity token 56 when initiated for the first time on a virtual machine 42 to ensure security of the virtual machine 42.  If block 302 is reached, this means that the agent executive 48 does not have an
agent identity token 56.  In block 302, the agent executive 48 obtains an agent API key.  In some embodiments, the agent executive 48 challenges a user for an API key.  In typical practice, the user provides the API key manually or via a user-provided
script when the agent executive 48 is started for the first time.  Regardless of how the API key is obtained it is communicated to the grid computer system 200 using the grid communication module 50 and process control passes to block 303.
<BR><BR> Block 303.
<BR><BR> In block 303, a determination is made as to whether the API key is authentic.  If so (303--Yes), process control passes to block 304.  If no (303--No), process control passes to block 312 where the request for an agent identity token 56 is
denied.  The user is notified of this failure.
<BR><BR> Block 304.
<BR><BR> In block 304, an agent identity token generator 144 (also known as the token generation module) operating on the grid computer system 200 generates, through a cryptographic token generation protocol, an agent identity token 56 when the API key
received from the grid communication module 50 in block 302 is deemed valid.  Any one of a number of cryptographic token generation protocols may be used to generate the agent identity token 56 from the API key.  In some embodiments, the token 56
includes a cryptographic key and/or information that will be used as shared knowledge 62.
<BR><BR> Block 306.
<BR><BR> In block 306, the agent communication module 148 responds to the request by the agent executive 48 for an agent identity token 56 by providing the token to the agent executive 48 using a secure communication method.
<BR><BR> Block 308.
<BR><BR> In block 308, the agent identity token 56 is stored in the agent data store 52 and process control passes to block 409.
<BR><BR> Block 320.
<BR><BR> Block 320 begins another process by which a first agent executive 48 may acquire an agent identity token 56.  Block 320 is reached in those instances where the first agent executive 48 actually has a valid agent identity token 56, but the agent
identity token 56 is already being used by a second active agent executive 48 of a second virtual machine 42 (parent virtual machine) that was initiated at an earlier date than the first virtual machine (212--Yes) (child virtual machine).  In such
instances, a new agent identity token 56 is generated for the child virtual machine through a cryptographic token generation protocol.
<BR><BR> Block 322.
<BR><BR> In block 322, the agent communication module 148 responds to the request by the agent executive 48 for an agent identity token 56 by providing the token to the agent executive 48 using a secure communication method such as the methods disclosed
in the section entitled "Message Security Protocol" below.
<BR><BR> Block 324.
<BR><BR> In block 324, the agent identity token 56 is stored in the agent data store 52 for later use and process control passes to block 409.  In preferred embodiments, agent identity token 56 is stored in a persistent data store (e.g., agent data store
52) maintained by agent executive 48.  In preferred embodiments, this persistent data store is encrypted at all times using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode utilizing a 256-bit key length as described in Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 197, Nov.  26, 2001.  In such embodiments, the key and initialization vector required by the agent executive 48 to access encrypted information in the persistent data store, including but not limited to
the agent identity token 56, is calculated using multiple data values some based on shared knowledge 62 and some dynamically generated on a one-time basis, that are provided by the remote grid computer 200.  This calculation involves agent executive 48
invocation of one of a plurality of possible dynamic key generation protocols, a non-limiting example of which is the Dynamic Symmetric Key Provisioning Protocol (DSKPP) (http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6063) in a draft status with the IETF at the time
of this disclosure.
<BR><BR> Message Security Protocol.
<BR><BR> The processes illustrated in FIG. 3B provide methods for securing an agent identity token 56 in agent data store 52.  As discussed in further detail below, FIGS. 4A-4D through 6A-6B illustrate exemplary processes directed to verifying the
integrity of virtual machine 42 and performing services for virtual machine 42 (e.g., imposition of a firewall) that require assignment of a unique agent identity token 56 to the virtual machine 42.  These exemplary processes further require
communication to take place between agent executive 48 and the grid computer system 200.  It is desirable that such communications take place in a manner that provides for message confidentiality and integrity.  Further, it is desirable that the agent
executive 48 and remote grid computer 200 be mutually able to authenticate the source of a message for the purposes of identification and authorization.  To accomplish this, a secure messaging protocol is used.  This secure messaging protocol, in
combination with an agent executive self-verification process described below in conjunction with FIGS. 4A-4D, and the use of unique agent identity tokens 56, satisfy the need for the agent executive 48 to be able to securely operate and communicate with
the remote server computer 100 in a relatively untrusted and/or uncontrolled environment, including the transmission of messages across untrusted and/or uncontrolled network environments.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, after agent executive 48 initialization, any message of any type that is generated by the grid computer system 200 to send to the agent executive 48, or by an agent executive 48 to send to the grid computer system 200, is
protected from unauthorized disclosure, corruption, replay or spoofing using the disclosed message security protocol.  As described in further detail below, the sender of a message assures message authenticity and integrity by utilizing a hash-based
message authentication code (HMAC) functionality, in combination with dynamically generated key based on shared secret knowledge between the sender and receiver, to generate a keyed message digest of the message payload.  This digest is added to the
original message payload, which is then encrypted utilizing the message confidentiality functionality described below, utilizing a dynamically generated key based on shared secret knowledge between the sender and receiver.
<BR><BR> The resulting ciphertext is transmitted to the receiver using a mutually authenticated, encrypted network tunnel.  In some embodiments, this transmission is secured using an SSL/TLS protocol.  TLS and SSL encrypt the segments of network
connections above the transport layer using asymmetric cryptography for transmission confidentiality and a keyed message authentication code for transmission integrity and reliability (see RFC 5246 or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer).
<BR><BR> The receiver of the message first decrypts the ciphertext after re-creating the symmetric encryption key based on shared secret knowledge between the sender and receiver.  If the sender asserted as part of the transmission metadata did not
actually send the message, then the shared secret knowledge will be incorrect and the ciphertext will not be successfully decrypted into a meaningful data structure.  In such cases the message will be ignored and the receiver may take actions including
triggering mechanisms to generate an alert to a possible attempt to compromise security.  If the ciphertext is successfully decrypted, the receiver then attempts to further verify authenticity and integrity of the message by re-generating the asserted
HMAC message digest included with the message using a key re-generated based on shared secret knowledge between the sender and receiver.  The message digest generated by the receiver will not match the asserted message digest and the message will be
considered inauthentic and/or corrupted by the receiver if the sender asserted as part of the transmission metadata did not actually generate the HMAC message digest of the message, or if the message has been changed in any fashion since generation of
the HMAC digest.  In such cases, the message will be ignored and the receiver may take actions including triggering mechanisms to generate an alert to a possible attempt to compromise security.  If the decipherment and message authentication/integrity
checks are both successful, the receiver will process the message.
<BR><BR> Message Authenticity and Integrity.
<BR><BR> In order to ensure the authenticity and integrity of such communications, one of a plurality of possible hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) functions is used (see, for example, IETF RFC 2104, "HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message
Authentication").  These HMAC functions utilize one or more secure hashing algorithms such as SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512, as defined more fully in Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 180-3 ("Secure Hash Standard (SHS)"),
October 2008.  In this messaging security protocol functionality, secret key material used to implement the HMAC is derived by means of a dynamic key generation algorithm mutually known to both the agent executive 48/grid communication module 50 and the
remote grid computer system 200.  Such key generation utilizes a plurality of encryption, hashing and randomization protocols, non-limiting examples of which include AES-256-CBC, the SHA-224 hashing algorithm, and/or the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.  In
some embodiments, such algorithms are combined into a multi-pass protocol that use as inputs key materials and/or initialization vectors generated from shared knowledge 62 between the grid communication module 50 and the remote grid computer system 200
and values derived from pseudo-random number generation protocols.  This algorithm generates secret key material of preferable length no less than 1024 bits, implementing a cryptographic keyspace of a size making it computationally infeasible to check
each possible key by brute force.  Prior to encryption, this secret key material is used as input to one of a plurality of HMAC implementations such as HMAC-SHA-224, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, or HMAC-SHA-512 (see FIPS 180-3).  The effect of this
combination of cryptographic techniques is implementation of a keyed message digest universally unique to each individual message, with the keyed message digest ensuring that a message may be authenticated and verified for integrity only by the grid
computer system 200 and the individual, universally unique agent executive 48/grid communication module 50 that generated a message or for which a message was intended.
<BR><BR> Message Confidentiality.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, confidentiality of messages shared between the agent executive 48 and the remote grid computer 200 is assured utilizing encryption of message payload with AES in CBC mode utilizing a 256-bit key length.  The symmetric key
used for encryption is derived by means of a dynamic key generation algorithm mutually known to both the agent executive 48 and the remote grid computer system 200.  This key generation algorithm utilizes one of a plurality of encryption, hashing and
randomization protocols, non-limiting examples of which include AES-256-CBC, the SHA-224 hashing algorithm, and the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.  In some embodiments, these algorithms are combined into a multi-pass protocol that use as inputs key materials
and/or initialization vectors generated from shared knowledge 62 between the agent executive 48 and the remote grid computer system 200, values derived from pseudo-random number generation protocols, and the agent identity token 56.  This algorithm
generates secret key material of length preferably no less than 1024 bits, implementing a cryptographic keyspace of a size making it computationally infeasible to check each possible key by brute force.  The effect of this combination of cryptographic
techniques is implementation of a message confidentiality system in which neither cryptographic key materials nor message payloads are transmitted through or stored within non-controlled, non-secure environments as cleartext, and message delivery in the
form of ciphertext that may be decrypted into meaningful and usable cleartext only by the grid computer system 200 and the individual, universally unique agent executive 48 that generated a message or for which a message was intended.
<BR><BR> Process for Verifying the Integrity of an Agent Executive 48 Using a Grid Computer System 200.
<BR><BR> FIGS. 4A-4D illustrate processes by which the integrity of an agent executive 48 can be verified using a grid computer system 200 in accordance with the present disclosure once the agent executive 48 has a valid agent identity token 56.
<BR><BR> What is depicted in FIGS. 4A, 4C, and 4D are two separate processes that run independent of each other.  The first process, blocks 404 through 408, serves to update self-verification factors 68 in the virtual machine 42 affected by a policy. 
Thus, the processes in FIGS. 4A, 4C, and 4D are executed, for each virtual machine 42 affected by agent self-verification factors 68, whenever a grid computer system 200 administrator changes such self-verification factors 68.  Typically, such
self-verification factors 68 form part of a policy that encompasses one or more virtual machines 42.  In such instances, when the grid computer system 200 administrator changes self-verification factors 68 within such a policy, the process depicted by
blocks 404 through 408 is run for each virtual machine 42 affected by the policy.
<BR><BR> Block 404.
<BR><BR> In block 404 the agent self-verification module 160 operating on the grid computer system 200 provides any updated self-verification factors 68 to the command queue 150 for the virtual machine 42.  The posting of such factors to the command
queue 150 for the virtual machine 42 is advantageous because, for security purposes, the agent executive 48 cannot accept a network connection from any device or process, regardless of whether any such device or process is running within the virtual
machine 42, including the agent self-verification module 160.  Thus, in order to communicate with the agent executive 48, the agent self-verification module 160 posts the factors to the command queue 150 for retrieval by the virtual machine 42.  Block
404 represents a process that is quite apart from, and independent of any self-verification process for any given virtual machine 42.  Whenever the self-verification factors 68 on the grid are updated for any reason, commands are put on the command
queues 150 for any and all agent executives 48 that are in the scope for the changes.
<BR><BR> Block 406.
<BR><BR> In block 406, the grid communication module 50 reads the command queue 150 for the updates to the agent self-verification factors 68.  The grid communication module sends back a response to the grid computer system 200 regarding whether or not
the new self-verification factors 68 were successfully updated.
<BR><BR> Block 408.
<BR><BR> In block 408, a determination is made as to whether the update of the self-verification factors was successful.  If so (408--Yes), process control passes to block 409.  If not (408--No), process control passes to block 420 in order to perform
failsafe actions.
<BR><BR> Block 409.
<BR><BR> Block 409 begins the process of self-verification.  In block 409, the agent executive 48 collects information for a self-evaluation for integrity of the agent executive 48 as dictated by the agent self-verification factors 68.  While the agent
executive 48 collects the information requested by the agent self-verification factors 68, the agent executive 48 does not actually use the information to determine the integrity of the agent executive 48.  Typically, the agent executive 48 stores the
information in the agent data store 52.  Regardless of whether the information is stored in data store 52, the information is encrypted and signed by the agent executive 48, as identified by the agent identity token 56 associated with the agent
executive, and communicated using a secure message security protocol such as the one described in the section above entitled "Message Security Protocol", to the agent self-verification module 160 operating on the grid computer system 200.
<BR><BR> Block 410.
<BR><BR> In block 410, the agent self-verification module 160, operating on the grid computer system 200, makes a determination as to whether any of the self-verification factors 68 have failed.  This is done by comparing the information collected in
block 408 to one or more associated self-verification rules in the set of self-verification rules 180.  If a factor has failed, (410--Yes), then process control passes to block 412.  Otherwise (410--No), the agent executive 48 is confirmed to be intact
and process control passes to block 502 of FIG. 5.
<BR><BR> Block 412.
<BR><BR> In block 412, a determination is made as to whether the failure detected in block 410 is correctable.  If so (412--Yes), process control passes to block 420 of FIG. 4B.  If the failure detected is not correctable (412--No), either because (i)
the failure was detected on a previous cycle and the agent self-verification corrective commands of FIG. 4B were not able to correct the problem during this previous cycle, or (ii) the initial pass through block 412 determined that the failure was not
correctable, process control passes to block 418 in order to initiate failsafe action.
<BR><BR> Block 418.
<BR><BR> In block 418, the agent executive 48 performs a failsafe action dictated by uncorrectable failure of an agent self-verification factor 68 including possible abortion of agent executive 48 and/or hardware virtual machine 42.  In practice,
although not illustrated in FIGS. 4A, 4B, and 4C, the manner in which failsafe action is taken in some embodiments is for agent self-verification module 160 to post agent self-verification failsafe commands to the command queue 150 associated with the
agent executive 48, where the agent self-verification failsafe commands encode one or more failsafe actions.  As such, agent self-verification failsafe commands include commands which will, for example, alert an administrator, shut down the agent
executive 48, shut down the virtual machine 42, or some combination of the above.  Moreover, other examples of failsafe actions including alerting the user by e-mail, setting the state of the agent to "requires attention" in the grid computer system 200,
starting a forensic data collection automatically, updating firewall rules or other security configuration parameters, etc. Multiple failsafe actions can be triggered.
<BR><BR> Block 420.
<BR><BR> Turning to FIG. 4B, block 420 is reached if a determination is made that a self-verification factor has failed but that such failure may be correctable.  In such instances, agent self-verification module 160 will place an agent self-verification
corrective command set into the command queue 150 associated with the agent executive 48, where the agent self-verification corrective command set encodes one or more corrective actions.  As such, agent self-verification corrective commands include
commands which will, if successfully implemented, cause the agent executive 48 to become valid.
<BR><BR> Block 422.
<BR><BR> The grid communication module 50 of the agent executive 48 reads the agent self-verification corrective commands and the agent executive 48 executes its commands.  The commands may require the collection of further data and/or actions to be
performed, such as changing a network communication port setting.
<BR><BR> Block 424.
<BR><BR> In some instances, after the agent self-verification corrective commands are executed, the information requested by the agent self-verification corrective commands and/or the status of the commands that required an action to be performed are
passed back to the agent-self-verification module 160.  As in all instances where information is passed between the server 100 to the grid computer system, such information is encrypted and signed by the agent executive 48, as identified by the agent
identity token 56 uniquely associated with the agent executive using, for example, the secure communication methods disclosed in the section entitled "Message Security Protocol" above.
<BR><BR> Block 426.
<BR><BR> If the agent-self-verification module 160 is satisfied with the information received (426--Yes), then the agent executive 48 is deemed corrected for the initial failure and process control passes on to block 409 to ensure correction.  If the
agent-self-verification module 160 is not satisfied with the information received (426--No), then the agent executive 48 is deemed not corrected for the initial failure and process control passes on to block 418.  It will be appreciated that the process
illustrated in FIG. 4B can be run in parallel for any number of correctable failures.
<BR><BR> Checking the Security, Compliance, and Integrity of Data Structures, Processes, File Systems, or States Associated with a Virtual Machine Using a Grid Computer System.
<BR><BR> FIG. 5 illustrates a method by which custom command sets 58 that check the security, compliance, and integrity of various data structures, processes, file systems, or states associated with a virtual machine 42 can be created using the grid
computer system 200 and communicated in a secure manner to a server computer 100 in accordance with the present disclosure.
<BR><BR> Block 502.
<BR><BR> In block 502 command sets 58 and corresponding rule sets 59 for processing command sets 58 are set up.  In some embodiments, there are two or more command sets 58 for a corresponding virtual machine 42, one for the checking the states of
security, compliance and integrity of the operating system 44 running on the virtual machine 42 and the other commands sets for checking the states of security, compliance, and integrity of various programs and/or data structures that are running and/or
present on the virtual machine 42 other than the operating system 44.
<BR><BR> One or more command sets 58 and their corresponding rule sets 59 constitute a policy domain.  The purpose of a policy domain is to establish a specific configuration for each type of virtual machine 42 which will help harden it against and react
to prevent attacks.  The policy domain consists of a set of commands 58 applied to both the operating system 44 and the applications 70 running on it and a corresponding set of rules 59 to ensure that the commands are appropriately executed.  Other
commands 58 and corresponding set of rules 59 might be associated with reactive actions designed to prevent a successful attack against virtual machine 42.  Groups of virtual machines 42, each running the same operating system 44 and applications 70 can
run the same policy domain, greatly reducing the number of command sets 58 that the grid computer system 200 needs.  In this way, any rules, commands, scheduling directives and configuration parameters, including firewall rules and configuration
directives, may be scoped to affect all virtual machines 42, a single virtual machine 42, or multiple user-defined groups of virtual machines.
<BR><BR> In the case of a multi-tenant system, many policy domains 152 reside in grid node 142.  If an operator has one or more private instances of grid module 142, there would likely be only one policy domain 152.  One API key is associated with each
policy domain 152.  The API key initially establishes an association between an agent identity token 56 and the policy domain 152.
<BR><BR> A management console associated with the grid computer system 200 is used to create, modify, or delete policy domains 152.  As such, the management console is used to create, modify, or delete one or more rules (and related commands or actions);
to modify the frequency with which sweeps and/or commands are executed by the agent executives 48; and to configure other parameters germane to the module in question (e.g., who should receive e-mail alerts, what kind of issue is considered "critical",
etc.).  Based on the scope of the creations, modifications, and deletions made in the management console, the grid computer system puts the commands needed to affect the changes into the command queues 150 of all the virtual machines 42 that are within
the scope of the policy domain that has been modified.
<BR><BR> Each respective command 66 in a command set 58 checks an important configuration of the operating system 44 and/or an application 70 running on the virtual machine 42 to which the respective rule is applicable.  The results of the commands 66
are checked against corresponding rules 59.  In some embodiments, each command 66 and its corresponding rule 59 are represented by a name (e.g., "cron should always be running") and a description.  (e.g., "the cron daemon should always be running").  In
some embodiments, there is an indication as to whether the failure of the rule 59 for a command 66 should be considered a critical risk.  If a rule is deemed critical, then failsafe action, up to termination of the virtual machine 42, is designated. 
However, the failure of a general rule 59 (e.g., a rule not directly associated with agent executive 48 self-verification) doesn't necessarily cause termination of agent executive 48 and virtual machine 42.  A rule failure can trigger one or more actions
that might include commands to attempt to remediate the issue, generating e-mail or other kinds of alerts, simply recording the rule failure, or going to the extreme of shutting down the agent executive 48 and the virtual machine 42 to absolutely contain
the compromise.
<BR><BR> Moreover, in some embodiments, rules 59 and, indeed commands 66 and/or commands sets 58, may be designated as active or de-activated.  Commands 66 for active command sets 58 are executed by agent executive 48 whereas non-active commands 66 are
stored by the grid computer system 200 but are not executed by the agent executive 48.  Importantly, while commands 66 are communicated to a server computer system 100, for security purposes, the rules 59 used to interpret the results of the commands
sets 58 remain on the grid computer system 200 and cannot be accessed by the server computer system 100.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, a command set 58 comprises one or more commands 66 for checking a status of a data structure accessible to the virtual machine 42 or for checking a status of a process running on the virtual machine 42.  In some embodiments,
a command set 58 comprises one or more commands 66 for checking the status of a setting associated with a file stored in the agent data store 52 (memory) accessible to the virtual machine 42, a setting of a directory stored in the memory accessible to
the virtual machine, or an existence or a status of a process running on the virtual machine 42.  In some embodiments, a command set 58 comprises one or more commands 66 for checking a password associated with a user or with a group of users of the
virtual machine 42.  In some embodiments, a command set 58 comprises one or more commands 66 for checking a status of a network communication port that is associated with the virtual machine 42.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, a command set 58 comprises one or more commands 66 for validation of a name-value pair in a file in a memory accessible by the virtual machine 42.  For instance, in some embodiments, a rule 59 comprises a configuration file
path (e.g., "/etc/httpd/httpd.conf", an optional configuration file section, a configuration item (first component of the name-value pair, e.g., "User"), a desired value (second component of the name-value pair, e.g., "nobody"), an optional configuration
file comment character (e.g., "#"), a configuration item/value delimiter, if any, and a remedial suggestion (e.g., "if this rule fails, the User setting in the Apache configuration file should be changed to `nobody`").  Thus, in the exemplary rule, if
the value for "User" in the Apache configuration file is set to other than "nobody" the rule requires that it be set to "nobody." Thus, in this example, the command 66 for the rule 59 would be to acquire the relevant name-value pair from the
file/etc/httpd/httpd.conf form the server computer 100 and the rule 59, operating on the grid computer system 200, would check to see if the name-value pair retrieved by the command 66 is correct (e.g., "User nobody").  If so, the rule passes.  If not,
the rule fails.
<BR><BR> Block 506.
<BR><BR> In block 506 the grid node 142 posts the command set 58 and/or updates intended for the agent executive 48 to the command queue 150 for virtual machine 42 in encrypted form.  In typical embodiments, this information is encrypted and signed prior
to sending it to the server computer 100, for example, in the manner set forth in the section entitled "Message Security Protocol" above.
<BR><BR> Block 508.
<BR><BR> In block 508 the communication module 50 reads the command set 58 and other updates from the command queue 150 for the virtual machine 42 and decrypts them, for example, in the manner set forth in the section entitled "Message Security
Protocol", above.  Process control then passes on to block 602 of FIG. 6A.
<BR><BR> Execution of Sweeps on the Server Computer 100 and the Analysis of Information Retrieved from Such Sweeps Using Rules Stored on the Grid Computer System 200.
<BR><BR> FIG. 6B illustrates an exemplary process for executing a sweep on the server computer 100 and sending the information from the sweep to the grid computer system 200 for evaluation against the rules 59.  Based on this evaluation, new commands 66
are provided to the server computer 100 by the grid computer system 200.
<BR><BR> Block 602.
<BR><BR> In block 602 the communication module 50 stores the command set 58 and/or the updated agent self-verification factors 68 in the agent data store 52.
<BR><BR> Block 606.
<BR><BR> In block 606, the agent executive 48 performs a sweep in accordance with the timing dictated by the command set 58 and/or the agent self-verification factors 68 and stores the results as the sweep results 64 in the agent data store 52.  In some
embodiments, block 606 only executes the commands 66 of one or more command sets 58 and does not collect information mandated by the agent self-verification factors 68.  In some embodiments, the commands 66 of one or more command sets 58 are executed and
the information mandated by the agent self-verification factors 68 is collected.  Examples of commands 66 that may be executed in block 606 are described in block 502 and further examples are provided below.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, a command 66 requests that a certain action be taken.  In one example, the command 66 may request that a file in a particular directory be deleted.  Such a command is an action command.  If an action command is executed in
block 606, then the status of the command is captured.  For instance, in the case where the action command 66 was to delete a file, the command 66 may achieve a status of "1" if the command 66 successfully deleted the file and "0" otherwise.  Non-binary
status results for action commands 66 are also possible and are within the scope of the present disclosure.  Additional non-limiting examples of action commands that may be executed in block 606 include starting or stopping a process in virtual machine
42, deleting, moving or renaming a file, combination of files or directory, altering the privileges of a user of virtual machine 42, changing the time interval for when sweeps in accordance with block 606 are performed, purging a cache, changing the
priority of a process running on the virtual machine 42, deleting or adding a user account, reinitializing the virtual machine 42, activating or deactivating a firewall or policy or a rule within a firewall policy, and making changes to configuration
parameters within the operating system 44 and application configuration files.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, a command 66 requests that certain information be retrieved from the virtual machine 42.  In one example, the command 66 may request that the size of a file in a particular directory be obtained.  Such a command is a
collection command.  If a collection command is executed in block 606, then the information requested by the command is captured.  More collection commands are described in greater detail in block 502 above.
<BR><BR> Block 608.
<BR><BR> In block 608, the communication module 50 sends the sweep results 64 in encrypted form, and signed by the agent executive 48, as identified by the agent identity token 56, to the grid computer system 200 using, for example, the techniques
disclosed in the section entitled "Message Security Protocol" above to ensure secure communication of the sweep results 64.  In some embodiments, sweep results 64 includes the identity and status of any action command that was executed in block 606 and
the data collected by any command that requested information in block 606.  In some embodiments, where block 606 also required that information dictated by agent self-verification factors 68 be collected, the sweep results further include the information
dictated by the agent self-verification factors 68.  It will be appreciated that there is benefit to requiring the agent executive 48 verification from time to time to ensure that the agent executive 48 has not become corrupt.  Thus, in some instances of
block 606, the information requested by the agent self-verification factors 68 will be collected and this information will be included in the sweep results 64 that are sent to the grid computer system 200 in block 608.
<BR><BR> Block 610.
<BR><BR> In block 610, the server scan module 158 (also known as the integrity validation module) decrypts and unsigns the sweep results 64 using, for example, the techniques disclosed in the section entitled "Message Security Protocol" above to ensure
secure communication of the sweep results 64.  The server scan module 158 then processes the sweep results 64 against the rules 59.  In one example, a command executed in block 66 required that a cryptographic hash of a particular file resident in the
corresponding virtual machine 42 be taken.  In such an instance, the rule 59 will compare the cryptographic hash value returned by the rule 59 to a predetermined value and, if the cryptographic hash value returned by the rule 59 does not match the
predetermined value, the rule 59 will fail.  Advantageously, for security reasons, the exact nature of the rules, such as the predetermined value, are stored on the secure grid computer system 200 rather than sent to the relatively untrustworthy or
uncontrolled virtual machine 42.
<BR><BR> Block 612.
<BR><BR> In block 612, the server scan module 158 determines the states of security, compliance, and integrity of the virtual machine 42 based on the processed sweep results 64 and, based on this integrity status, develops a new command set 58 or other
instructions for the virtual machine 42.  Blocks 602 through 612 show the <B><I>power</I></B> of the present disclosure.  Information can be queried or action can be taken by the integrity-verified agent executive 48 using thoroughly authenticated and verifiable
commands 66 acting on a relatively unsecure virtual machine 42 and the results of such commands can be analyzed using rules 59 that are in the secure grid computer system 200.  In this way, in combination with other aspects of the disclosure, the states
of security, compliance and integrity of virtual machine 42 and the programs running on the virtual machine are continuously assessed, analyzed, and improved.
<BR><BR> Block 614.
<BR><BR> In block 614, a determination is made as to whether a rule in rule set 59 failed.  If a determination is made that a rule 59 has failed (614--Yes), then process control passes to block 616.  If no rule 59 has failed (614--No), then process
control passes directly to block 618.
<BR><BR> Block 616.
<BR><BR> In block 616, a determination is made as to whether the failure identified in block 614 is correctable.  If a rule in rule set 59 failed and the failure is correctable (616--Yes), then process control passes to block 618 where corrective actions
are posted to the command queue 150 for the virtual machine 42 or virtual machines 42 for which the rule failed.  If the rule failure is deemed not correctable (616--No), then process control passes to block 630 where failsafe action is taken.  In some
instance, a rule failure is deemed not correctable after corrective actions were attempted by blocks 618 and 620 and such corrective action failed to remove the rule failure.
<BR><BR> Block 618.
<BR><BR> In block 618, the server scan module 158 posts a new command set 58 or other instructions for the hardware virtual machine 42 to the command queue 150 for the virtual machine 42 in encrypted and signed form.  If a rule in rule set 59 failed and
the failure is deemed correctable, instructions to attempt correction are posted to the command queue 150 for the virtual machine 42 in encrypted and signed form as well.
<BR><BR> If a rule in rule set 59 failed and the failure is deemed correctable then, in practice, the manner in which corrective action is taken in some embodiments is for the server scan module 158 to post a pre-configured or dynamically generated
remedial command set 58 to the command queue 150 associated with the agent executive 48, where the remedial command set 58 encodes one or more corrective actions directed to correcting some aspect of the virtual machine 42.  Nonlimiting examples of what
may be corrected include, but are not limited to, changing a firewall setting, altering a status of a data structure accessible to the virtual machine 42, altering a process running on the virtual machine 42, changing a setting associated with a file
stored in a memory accessible to the virtual machine 42, changing a setting of a directory stored in a memory accessible to the virtual machine 42, changing a password associated with a user or with a group of users of the virtual machine 42, resetting
or altering a name-value pair in a file in a memory accessible by the virtual machine 42, or changing a network communication port setting that is associated with the virtual machine 42.
<BR><BR> Block 620.
<BR><BR> Once commands, for example commands designed to correct a self-verification factor 68 failure or rule 59 failure have been posted to the command queue 150 associated with the agent executive 48, the grid communication module 50 of the agent
executive 48 reads the command set 58 and decrypts them and verifies the signature.  In typical embodiments, the techniques disclosed in the section entitled "Message Security Protocol" above are used to communicate this information to the agent
executive 48.
<BR><BR> Block 622.
<BR><BR> In block 622, the agent executive 48 stores the new command set 58 and/or other data to the agent data store 52.  The agent executive 48 performs any instructions retrieved from the command queue 150 for the virtual machine 42 that dictate
attempting to correct failed rules in rule set 59.  Once block 622 is completed, process control passes back to block 606 and another iteration of the loop beginning at this block is performed in accordance with the periodic interval or schedule dictated
by a command set 58 or by the agent executive 48 itself.
<BR><BR> Block 630.
<BR><BR> Block 630 is reached if a failsafe action needs to be taken because one or more rules in rule set 59 have failed.  Such failsafe action may include one or more actions.  Such one or more actions may include notifying the user of the failure
and/or the posting of failsafe instructions to the command queues 150 for the virtual machines 42 on which the rule in the rule set 59 failed.  If such instructions are posted on queues 150 of affected virtual machines 42, in subsequent steps not
illustrated in FIG. 6B, such failsafe instructions are read by the virtual machines 42 and executed by the agent executives 48 of the affected virtual machines 42.  Depending on the nature of the failsafe action, process control may (i) pass back to
block 606 and another iteration of the loop beginning at this block is performed in accordance with the periodic interval or schedule dictated by a command set 58 or by the agent executive 48 itself or (ii) termination of the affected virtual machines 42
initiated.
<BR><BR> FIG. 7 illustrates conceptually an environment in which some embodiments operate.  As illustrated, the environment may include zero or more virtual machine servers 100, such as VM Server 100-1.  As used herein, a virtual machine server 100 may
also be referred to as a server computer, a server, or a server system.  As described above with respect to FIG. 1A, a virtual machine server 100 includes a hypervisor 40, which instantiates virtual machines 42, such as virtual machines 42-1 and 42-2. 
Each virtual machine 42 runs an operating system 44, such as the first operating system 44-V1 for the first virtual machine 42-1 and the second operating system 44-V2 for the second virtual machine 42-2.  Note that each virtual machine 42 has its own
instance of an operating system, and the operating systems need not be the same (e.g., the first operating system 44-V1 may be Linux.RTM., and the second operating system 44-V2 may be Microsoft.RTM.  Windows.RTM..
<BR><BR> Each operating system runs an agent controller 46 and an agent executive 48.  The agent executive 48 is also referred to as a security control module 48.  The task of the agent controller is to guarantee that the security control module 48
remains running at all times.  Also running within each operating system 44 are one or more applications 70, such as the first applications 70-V1 running in the first operating system 44-V1 and the second applications 70-V2 running in the second
operating system 44-V2.  Each application 70 typically includes many distinct files, such as executable programs, configuration files, and data files.
<BR><BR> Some embodiments also include computing devices 800 that are not running virtual machines 42.  For example, a first computing device 800-1 runs an operating system 44-D1, and within the operating system are running an agent controller 46-D1 and
an agent executive (security control module) 48-D1.  An agent controller 46 and an agent executive 48 perform the same security monitoring and control whether they are running on a virtual machine server 100 with many virtual machines or running on an
individual computing device.
<BR><BR> The virtual machine servers 100 and computing devices 800 communicate over network(s) 26 (e.g., the Internet and/or a corporate LAN) to one or more grid computers 200 (also referred to as security servers).  As described above with respect to
FIG. 1B, a grid computer 200 includes an agent identity token generator 144, a shared knowledge store 170, an agent communication module 148, a policy domain 152, a scan module 158, and an agent self-verification module 160.
<BR><BR> A grid computer 200 can provide security for many individual virtual machines 42 or computing devices 800.  In addition, virtual machines 42 running on a single virtual machine server 100 may be serviced by two or more distinct grid computers
200.  For example, some embodiments spread out the processing load from the agent executives across multiple grid computers 200 in order to provide better load balancing.
<BR><BR> As described above, the grid computers 200 cannot initiate communication with an agent executive 48 running on a virtual machine 42 or computing device 800 because the agent executive should not have open network ports.  Instead, the agent
executives initiate communication with the appropriate grid computer 200 to send information and/or retrieve information (e.g., retrieve commands from a designated command queue 150).
<BR><BR> As illustrated in FIG. 8, some computing devices 800 utilize the security server 200 for a single operating system 44, without a virtual machine.  The computing device 800 does not require a hypervisor 40 or virtual machines 42.  The agent
executive 48 monitors and controls security of an operating system 44, including the integrity of the agent executive 48 itself and the integrity of one or more applications 70 running on the operating system 44.
<BR><BR> FIG. 8 is a block diagram illustrating a computing device 800.  A computing device may be a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a smart phone, an embedded computing device in an automobile, an embedded computing device in an
electronic appliance, an embedded computing device in a medical device, a point of sale terminal, or other computing device having a processing unit, memory, and a network communication interface.  In addition a computing device 800 may be a server 100,
running a hypervisor 40 and one or more virtual machines 42, as illustrated in FIGS. 1A and 7.
<BR><BR> A computing device 800 typically includes one or more processing units (CPUs) 802 for executing modules, programs, or instructions stored in memory 814 and thereby performing processing operations; one or more network or other communications
interfaces 804; memory 814; and one or more communication buses 812 for interconnecting these components.  The communication buses 812 may include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls communications between system
components.  Some computing devices 800 include a user interface 806 comprising a display device 808 and one or more input devices or mechanisms 810.  In some embodiments, the input device/mechanism includes a keyboard and a mouse; in some embodiments,
the input device/mechanism includes a "soft" keyboard, which is displayed as needed on the display device 808, enabling a user to "press keys" that appear on the display 808.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the memory 814 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices.  In some embodiments, the memory 814 includes non-volatile memory, such as one or more
magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices.  In some embodiments, the memory 814 includes one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU(s) 802.  The
memory 814, or alternately the non-volatile memory device(s) within the memory 814, comprises a non-transitory computer readable storage medium.  In some embodiments, the memory 814, or the computer readable storage medium of the memory 814, stores the
following programs, modules, and data structures, or a subset thereof: an operating system 44, which includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks; a communications module 818, which is used
for connecting the computing device 800 to other computers and devices via the one or more communication network interfaces 804 (wired or wireless) and one or more communication networks 26, such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area
networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on; a display module 820, which receives input from the one or more input devices 810, and generates user interface elements for display on the display device 808; an agent executive 48 (also referred to as a
security control module), which is described above with respect to FIG. 1A as well as FIGS. 2, 3A, 3B, 4A-4D, 5, 6A, and 6B.  The agent executive 48 includes various executable components or modules in addition to various data, including data stored in
an agent data store 52; and one or more applications 70, which run in the operating system 44.  In some instances, the applications 70 have associated application data 822, such as configuration data, a usage log, or working data (e.g., files created by
a user of the applications 70).
<BR><BR> Each of the above identified executable modules, applications, or sets of procedures may be stored in one or more of the previously mentioned memory devices and corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above.  The
above identified modules or programs (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures, or modules, and thus various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments. 
In some embodiments, the memory 814 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified above.  Furthermore, the memory 814 may store additional modules or data structures not described above.
<BR><BR> Although FIG. 8 shows a computing device 800, FIG. 8 is intended more as a functional description of the various features that may be present rather than as a structural schematic of the embodiments described herein.  In practice, and as
recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, items shown separately could be combined and some items could be separated.
<BR><BR> FIGS. 9A-9E provide a process flow 900 for implementing security on a computing device in accordance with some embodiments.  The computing device has (902) one or more processing units and memory.  In some embodiments, the computing device is
(904) a server system including one or more servers, such as the server system 100 illustrated in FIG. 1A.  In some embodiments, the computing device is (906) a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, or a smart phone.  In some
embodiments, the computing device is (908) an embedded component of an automobile or an embedded component of an electrical appliance (such as a medical device).  In some embodiments, the computing device is a point-of-sale terminal.  In some
embodiments, the computing device includes a hypervisor 40 and one or more virtual machines.  In some embodiments, the computing device includes a single operating system, which is not executing within a virtual machine.
<BR><BR> The computing device includes (910) a first security control module 48 (also referred to as an agent executive), which is stored in the memory and executed by one or more of the processing units.  The first security control module monitors (912)
and controls (912) security of a first operating system and security of one or more first applications executing within the first operating system, as illustrated above in FIGS. 1A, 7, and 8.  In some embodiments, the first security control module
executes (914) within the first operating system, as illustrated in FIGS. 1A and 7.  In some embodiments, the first operating system is (916) is the sole operating system running on the computing device, as illustrated in FIG. 8.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the computing device is a server system that instantiates one or more virtual machines, as illustrated in FIG. 1A.  In these embodiments, the computing device includes (918) a hypervisor module, which instantiates virtual
machines on the computing device.  In some embodiments, the first operating system executes (920) within a first virtual machine instantiated in the memory by the hypervisor module.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the memory stores (922) a second virtual machine instantiated by the hypervisor module, as illustrated in FIGS. 1A and 7.  The second virtual machine includes (924) a second operating system and a second security control
module.  The second security control module is executed (926) by one or more of the processing units to monitor and control security of the second operating system and security of one or more second applications executing within the second operating
system.  Typically, the memory allocated to the first virtual machine is (928) distinct from the memory allocated to the second virtual machine.  Programs within one virtual machine have no visibility or access to memory used by another virtual machine.
<BR><BR> The security for an operating system and the programs running in the operating system (including the security control module itself) is monitored and evaluated by a remote security server 200, which is also referred to as a grid server.  Because
a single remote security server can monitor and evaluate many computing devices (and many individual virtual machines on a single computing device in some embodiments), security policies are used to identify what security applies to each security control
module.  A single policy typically applies to multiple security control modules.
<BR><BR> The security control module transmits (930) to a remote security server a policy id, which identifies (932) a security policy that applies to the first operating system and applies to the one or more first applications.  As illustrated in FIGS.
1A and 1B, each policy has an associated set of commands and an associated set of rules for evaluating the collected data (e.g., data about each security control module, data about the operating system in which each security control module is running,
and/or data about one or more applications running in each operating system).  The remote security server generates a token with a first cryptographic key and transmits it to the security control module.  The security control module receives (934) the
first cryptographic key from the remote security server.  The first cryptographic key is uniquely associated (934) with the first security control module.
<BR><BR> The security control module periodically uses (936) the first cryptographic key to securely retrieve from the remote security server a respective set of commands (e.g., from a command queue 150 at the remote security server 200, as illustrated
in FIG. 1B).  The respective set of commands is selected (938) by the remote security server according to the security policy, according to the current state of the first operating system, according to the current state of the first security control
module, and/or according to the current state of one or more first applications running in the first operating system.  This is described above with respect to FIGS. 6A and 6B.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the current state of the first operating system includes (940) one or more of: a current set of processes running in the first operating system; a current set of authorized users of the first operating system; a current set
of files and directories accessible to the first operating system; current metadata for files and directories accessible to the first operating system; or current content of one or more configuration files for the first operating system.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the current state of the one or more first applications includes (942) one or more of: information that identifies which of the one or more first applications are running; a current set of authorized users of the one or more
first applications; a current set of files and directories associated with the one or more first applications; current metadata for files and directories associated with the one or more first applications; and/or current content of one or more
configuration files for the one or more first applications.
<BR><BR> In some embodiments, the current state of the first security module includes one or more of: a current set of files and directories associated with the security control module; current metadata for files and directories associated with the
security control module; and/or current content of one or more configuration files for the security control module.
<BR><BR> The respective set of commands can include commands to perform various operations in the first operating system.  At noted above, the remote security server selects the commands and puts them into a queue 150, which are retrieved by the security
control module for execution.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the respective set of commands includes (944) a command to update a firewall policy for the first operating system.  For example, a user may modify a firewall policy associated with a certain security policy.  Each security
control module using that security policy will be updated by placing appropriate commands in the command queues for each relevant security control module.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the respective set of commands includes (946) a command to collect information about the first security control module according to a set of self-verification factors.  In some embodiments, the self verification factors are
stored in the agent data source associated with the security control module, as illustrated in FIG. 1A.  In some embodiments, the self-verification factors are included with the command to collect information about the security control module.  The
collected information enabled the remote security server to evaluate the integrity of the security control module itself (e.g., determine whether some malware has modified a program or a configuration parameter for the security control module).  In some
embodiments, stored self-verification factors at computing device can be subsequently modified by commands from the security server.
<BR><BR> Security of a computing device is an ongoing activity, and thus commands are periodically retrieved (936) as noted above.  In some instances, one or more of the commands in the respective set are scheduled (948) to repeat execution at a
predetermined time.  In some instances, one or more of the commands in the respective set are scheduled (950) to repeat execution at predetermined time intervals.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the respective set of commands includes (952) a command to reinitialize the first security control module.  In some instances, reinitializing the first security control module may resolve certain issue with the integrity of
the first security module (whether due to malware or not).
<BR><BR> In some instances, the respective set of commands includes (954) a command to terminate execution of the first operating system.  This is typically a last resort when corruption or malware has been identified and corrective actions have been
unsuccessful.  This is an example of a failsafe action, as described above with respect to FIG. 6B.  In some embodiments, when execution of the operation is terminated an alert message is transmitted to one or more users to point out the situation and
the action taken.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the respective set of commands includes (956) a command to collect configuration settings of one or more files or directories stored in the memory.  This collected data will be subsequently evaluated by the remote security
server.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the respective set of commands includes (958) a command to collect password information for one or more users of the first operating system.  In some instances, the password information includes (960) encrypted passwords of
the one or more users.  For example, this can enable the remote security server to identify if any passwords have been modified.  In some instances, the password information includes access rights associated with one or more users.  This can be used to
determine if a user's access rights have been elevated to an improper level.  In some instances, the password information includes access groups or access roles assigned to users.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the respective set of commands includes (962) a command to collect information regarding network communication ports for the first operating system.  For example, in some instances the collected information regarding network
communication ports identifies (964) any open network communication ports for the first operating system or open network communication ports for the first security control module.
<BR><BR> Sometime malware changes the set of processes that are running within the operating system.  This may involve running an additional process that should not be running, terminating execution of a process that should be running, or modifying an
existing process in some way.  Some embodiments detect such problems by gathering information about the processes.  In some instances, the respective set of commands includes (968) a command to collect information that identifies what processes are
running in the memory.  This can enable the remote server to identify processes that have been added or removed.  In some instances, the respective set of commands includes (966) a command to collect information regarding one or more processes running in
the memory.  This information about running processes may identify resources used the processes, such as memory, file handles, CPU usage, and so on.  The information may also identify how long the process has been running or a user account under which
the process is running.
<BR><BR> After the security control module retrieves the respective set of commands, the security control module executes (970) each command in the respective set.  In some embodiments, the commands have a defined order, and the commands are executed in
the defined order.  For example, a command to perform a corrective action may be sequenced before another command to gather information.  The gathered information may be used by the remote security server to determine whether the corrective action was
successful.
<BR><BR> Each command is (972) either a command to modify execution of an executable program or process, a command to collect information about the first operating system, about the security control module, or about the one or more first applications, or
a command to perform an action that modifies data associated with the first operating system, data associated with the security control module, or data associated with the one or more first applications.  For example, commands to terminate execution of
the operating system, reinitialize the security control module, terminate a process, or start a process are all commands that modify execution of an executable program or process.  Collection commands include commands that collect data about the security
control module, collect data about one or more applications, collect data about the operating system, or collect data about one or more files or directories.  Commands that modify data include commands that insert new data, remove existing data, and/or
change existing data.  Modification commands can change configuration parameters (for the operating system, for the security control module, or for one or more of the applications), change user access rights, change data or metadata associated with the
operating system or any application running in the operating system, and so on.
<BR><BR> The information collected by the collection commands is evaluated by the remote security server based on rules stored at the remote security server.  The security control module just collects the information according to the commands, then
transmits the collected data to the remote security server.  In particular, the first security control module includes (974) instructions that execute when the respective set of commands includes one or more commands to collect information about the
first operating system, about the security control module, or about the one or more first applications.  The instructions securely transmit (974) the collected information to the remote security server for evaluation.  In some embodiments, securely
transmitting the collected information includes (976) using the cryptographic key and data shared with the remote security server to digitally sign and encrypt the collected information prior to transmitting the collected information to the remote
security server.
<BR><BR> FIGS. 10A-10E provide a process flow 1000 for implementing security using a security server 200 in accordance with some embodiments.  The security server identifies commands to be executed on each computing device, and places the commands in a
queue.  As illustrated above, the computing device retrieves the commands and executes them, then returns requested data to the security server.  The security server evaluates the collected data (e.g., comparing the data against a set of rules).  When
anomalies are detected, corrective commands are placed into the queue for execution on the computing device.  Typically the process of receiving and evaluating data collected by the security control module occurs on a regular periodic basis, such as
every minute, every ten minutes, or every hour.  The frequency can depend on the type of the computing device.  For example, if the computing device is part of a server farm that instantiates virtual machines, there is probably high bandwidth
connectivity, so the process may occur frequently.  On the other hand, if the computing device is an embedded component in an automobile, the process may occur less frequently (e.g., two or three times a day).
<BR><BR> The security server 200 has (1002) one or more processing units and memory.  The security server 200 includes (1004) a token generation module 144, which is stored in the memory and executed by one or more of the processing units.  The token
generation module 144 receives (1006) a request from a security control module 48 running within a first operating system 44 on a remote computing device distinct from the security server 200.  As noted above with respect to FIGS. 9A-9E, the computing
device may be a server with a hypervisor instantiating a plurality of virtual machines, or a device running a single operating system, such as an individual user computer, a computing device embedded in machine (e.g., a automobile or electrical
appliance), or a point-of-sale terminal.  The request includes (1008) a policy identifier that identifies a security policy.  A security policy determines what security will be applied (e.g., what applications will be monitored, what processes will be
monitored, what individual files and folders will be monitored, and so on).
<BR><BR> The token generation module 144 generates (1010) a unique agent identity token for the security control module.  The agent identity token includes (1010) a cryptographic key.  In some embodiments, the agent identity token includes a piece of
information that will be shared by the security server and the security control module (but but by any other device).  The shared information and the cryptographic key can be used to guarantee integrity of communication between the security control
module and the security server.  Each distinct security control module instance has a unique agent identity token, which corresponds to a unique command queue on the security server.  The token generation module 144 transmits (1012) the agent identity
token to the security control module.
<BR><BR> The security server 200 also includes (1014) an integrity validation module 158, which is stored in the memory of the security server and executed by one or more of the processing units of the security server.  In some embodiments, the security
control module initiates a self-validation before (1016) the security server selects the first set of commands.  In some embodiments, the security control module collects initial self-validation data using a set of self-validation factors stored with the
security control module.  The integrity validation module 158 at the security server securely receives (1018) the data collected about the security control module.  The integrity validation module 158 then uses (1020) the collected data to evaluate the
integrity of the security control module.  When the evaluation identifies an integrity failure, the integrity validation module 158 places (1022) one or more corrective commands in the command queue 150 for retrieval and execution by the security control
module 48 on the remote computing device.
<BR><BR> The integrity validation module 158 selects (1024) a first set of commands according to the identified security policy, according to a current state of the first operating system, according to a current state of the security control module,
and/or according to a current state of one or more applications running in the first operating system on the remote computing device.  The first set of commands may contain commands for different unrelated purposes, such as one command to collect
information about the operating system on the computing device, a second command to update a firewall policy, and a third command to collect information about an application running on the computing device.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the first set of commands includes (1026) a command to update a firewall policy for the remote computing device.  For example, a user may specify changes to a firewall policy by updating the corresponding security policy on
the security server.  Subsequently, the changes are placed into command queues 150 for each of the affected operating systems (e.g., a hundred virtual machines or a dozen embedded devices).
<BR><BR> In some instances, the first set of commands includes (1028) a first command to update self-verification factors stored at the remote computing device.  In embodiments that store the self-verification factors with the security control module,
updates are sometimes required based on new knowledge about malware.  In other embodiments, the self-verification factors are included in the relevant self-verification commands each time they are used, and thus the most current self-verification factors
are used automatically.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the first set of commands includes (1030) a second command to collect data about the security control module.  If the factors have been updated by a command in the first set of commands, the second command uses (1032) the
updated self-verification factors.  In some embodiments, the first set of commands includes (1034) a third command to communicate the collected data to the security server for evaluation.  In other embodiments, whenever a set of commands includes one or
more commands to collect data, the collected data is automatically communicated to the security server.
<BR><BR> In some instances, one or more of the commands in the first set of commands are scheduled (1036) to repeat at a predetermined time.  In some instances, one or more of the commands in the first set of commands are scheduled (1038) to repeat at
predetermined time intervals.  For example, commands to collect basic integrity information may be repeated every five minutes or once an hour.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the first set of commands includes (1040) a command to reinitialize the security control module.  For example, the security server may change one or more configuration parameters for the security control module and
reinitialize the security control module so that the new parameters take effect.  As another example, the integrity validation module may identify anomalous data for the security control module, and reinitializing may be able to resolve the problem.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the first set of commands includes (1042) a command to terminate execution of the first operating system on the remote computing device.  This is a severe action, and is typically applied only when the integrity validation
module identifies a significant security problem that cannot be resolved by less drastic measures.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the first set of commands includes (1044) a command to collect configuration settings of one or more files or directories stored in memory associated with the first operating system on the remote computing device.  For
example, if a critical file should be read-only, a command may read the attributes of the critical file to verify the read-only attribute has not changed.  As another example, suppose a directory with specific operating system files should not be
altered.  A command may collect information on the number of files in the directory, the names of the files, the sizes of the files, and so on to guarantee that the system has not been compromised.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the first set of commands includes (1046) a command to collect password information for one or more users of the first operating system on the remote computing device.  The password information may include access rights
associated with certain users, whether there have been failed login attempts, whether passwords meet strength requirements, and so on.  In some instances, the password information includes the passwords themselves in encrypted form.  This can be used to
determine whether a password has been modified.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the first set of commands includes (1048) a command to collect information regarding network communication ports for the security control module.  In some instances, the collected information regarding network communication
ports identifies (1050) any open network communication ports for the security control module.  To protect the integrity of the security control module, it should not have any open network ports, so the existence of any open ports would represent an
anomalous condition.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the first set of commands includes (1052) a command to collect information regarding one or more processes running in memory associated with the first operating system on the remote computing device.  The information may
include the resources used by each process (e.g., memory, CPU), how long each process has been running, the user ID or account under which each process is running, and so on.
<BR><BR> In some instances, the first set of commands includes (1054) a command to collect information that identifies what processes are running in memory associated with the first operating system on the remote computing device.  This information can
be used to identify whether there are any unexpected processes running or whether any expected processes are not running.
<BR><BR> As noted above, the selection of commands is based on several factors, including the current state of the first operating system.  The current state of the first operating system is known based on data collected by the security control module. 
In particular, the current state of the first operating system includes (1056) one or more of: a current set of processes running in the first operating system; a current set of authorized users of the first operating system; a current set of files and
directories accessible to the first operating system; current metadata for files and directories accessible to the first operating system; or current content of one or more configuration files for the first operating system.
<BR><BR> Similarly, the selection of commands is based on the current state of one or more applications running in the operating system.  This information is collected by the security control module.  The current state of the one or more applications
includes (1058) one or more of: information that identifies which of the one or more applications are running; a current set of authorized users of the one or more applications; a current set of files and directories associated with the one or more
applications; current metadata for files and directories associated with the one or more applications; or current content of one or more configuration files for the one or more applications.
<BR><BR> Finally, the selection of commands is based on the current state of the security control module, which is based on data previously collected by the security control module (e.g., using the self-verification factors).  The current state of the
security control module includes (1060) one or more of: a current set of files and directories associated with the security control module; current metadata for files and directories associated with the security control module; or current content of one
or more configuration files for the security control module.
<BR><BR> When the first set of commands is selected, the integrity validation module 158 places (1062) the first set of commands into a command queue 150 for retrieval and execution by the security control module on the remote computing device.
<BR><BR> After the security control module retrieves and executes the first set of commands, the security control module transmits the collected data 64 to the security server 200.  The integrity validation module securely receives (1064) from the
security control module the data collected at the remote computing device, which was collected by executing one or more of the commands in the first set of commands.  In some embodiments, securely receiving the collected data is performed by using (1066)
the cryptographic key and data shared data with the remote computing device to decrypt the received data and verify the digital signature.
<BR><BR> The integrity validation module uses (1068) the data collected at the remote computing device to evaluate integrity of protected systems corresponding to the data collected.  In some embodiments, the protected systems include (1074) the first
operating system on the remote computing device.  In some embodiments, the protected systems include (1076) the security control module itself.  In some embodiments, the protected systems include (1078) one or more applications running in the first
operating system on the remote computing device.  In some embodiments, evaluating integrity of a respective protected system uses (1070) a respective set of rules stored at the security server.  For example, a rule may specify what data is expected for a
certain data collection operation.  When a rule of the respective set of rules fails (e.g., results not matching expected results), the integrity validation module posts (1072) a corrective or proactively protective action to the command queue for
retrieval and execution by the security control module.
<BR><BR> Security is an ongoing process, so the process of selecting commands and evaluating retrieved data repeats.  The specific commands selected depend on the results from the previous iteration.  In particular, the integrity validation module
selects (1080) a second set of commands according to the identified security policy and results of the integrity evaluation (which was based on the previously collected data).  The integrity validation module places (1082) the second set of commands into
the command queue for retrieval and execution by the security control module on the remote computing device.
<BR><BR> In sum, during each iteration the integrity validation module selects a set of commands according to the identified security policy, according to a current state of the first operating system, according to a current state of the security control
module, and according to a current state of one or more applications running in the first operating system on the remote computing device.  The set of commands are placed into the appropriate command queue, and are subsequently retrieved by the security
control module.  The security control module executes each of the commands, which either perform an action or collect data.  The security control module then securely transmits the collected data to the security server.  The integrity validation module
evaluates the collected data according to various rules, and the next set of commands is collected, beginning the next iteration.
