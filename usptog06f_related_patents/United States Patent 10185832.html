       <p> Provided are processes of monitoring or modifying a network of
     electronically connected assets that dynamically builds relationships and
     dependencies among detected vulnerabilities in one or more of the assets
     and sensor measurements so that risk assessment can be achieved more
     accurately and in real-time. A process includes: identifying a plurality
     of vulnerabilities on a network of electronically interconnected devices
     representing one or more critical assets; determining dependencies
     between each vulnerability in the plurality of vulnerabilities; creating
     a hidden Markov model representing an attack state of each vulnerability
     of the plurality of vulnerabilities; determining the exploit likelihood
     of each of the attack states at a first time; determining the most
     probable sequences or paths of the attack states; and identifying
     dynamically the risk of one or more of the critical assets based on the
     sequences or paths of attack states.

<BR><BR> This application contains and refers to Computer Program Listing Appendix A and Computer Program Listing Appendix B, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>FIELD
<BR><BR> The present invention relates generally to the field of cyber security assessment and, more particularly, to a system, method and apparatus for assessing a cyber risk within an operational technology infrastructure.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR> Risk in a network or operational technology infrastructure is usually defined as the probability that an adverse event or action occurs and results in a negative impact or consequence.  In the context of cyber security, risk refers to the
expected likelihood and consequences of threats or attacks on cyber assets.  Risk assessment involves identifying threats and vulnerabilities, computing the occurrence likelihood of threats, and then determining the impact and consequences of exploiting
vulnerabilities by threats.  The minimal requirement for the risk assessment of any system is to characterize threats, vulnerabilities, effectiveness and operational status of the system's defenses for particular threats.
<BR><BR> Risk quantification needs the scoring of vulnerabilities.  In this regard, the Security Content Automation Program (SCAP), developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), supports the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
providing a repository for known vulnerabilities and software that contains these vulnerabilities.  As part of SCAP, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides a score for each new software vulnerability discovered that prioritizes the
importance of the vulnerability.  In addition to scoring vulnerabilities, risk quantification requires the scoring of exploit likelihood and attack impact, so that the simplest risk score of an individual vulnerability can be obtained by the product of
its exploit likelihood and impact.
<BR><BR> A major issue with prior methods of assessing risk is that they do not have the ability to dynamically determine risk to any particular region of a network and project that risk to a time in the future.  The methods and systems as provided
herein address this problem by progressively developing a dynamic representation of cyber vulnerabilities, exploitation, and observations of a network using integrated Bayesian, Markov, and state space models in order to encode dynamically quantitative
and qualitative knowledge and measurements of cyber security vulnerabilities, exploits, and attack impacts.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR> The following summary of the invention is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the innovative features unique to the present invention and is not intended to be a full description.  A full appreciation of the various aspects of the
invention can be gained by taking the entire specification, claims, drawings, and abstract as a whole.
<BR><BR> Provided are processes, systems, and apparatuses suitable for identifying risk and defending attacks in cyber assets such as networked cyber infrastructure and other systems and devices connected to or exposed to an externally accessible
network.  The processes provided herein are unique, real-time methods of identifying and defending against attack of one or more critical assets that can identify how vulnerabilities in a cyber critical asset are related, are or could potentially be
subjected to an attack and how such an attack may flow through a network so that such an attack can effectively be stopped, prevented, or otherwise defended.
<BR><BR> It is a first object to provide processes of defending attack of one or more critical assets within a network of electronically interconnected devices in real-time.  Such processes may include one or more of: identifying a plurality of
vulnerabilities on a network of electronically interconnected devices representing one or more critical assets; determining dependencies between each vulnerability in said plurality of vulnerabilities; creating a hidden Markov model for the plurality of
vulnerabilities and their relevant observations, where each state of the model represents the attack state of a distinct vulnerability; determining the exploit likelihood of each of the vulnerabilities at a first time; determining the impact of
exploitation of each of the vulnerabilities at the first time; determining the most probable sequences or paths of attack states representing exploited vulnerabilities; and identifying dynamically the risk of one or more of said critical assets based on
exploit likelihood and exploitation impact of said sequences or paths of attack states to thereby defend against any potential or identified attack within the network.  In some aspects, one or more of the plurality of vulnerabilities is a group of two or
more vulnerabilities grouped as desired by a user illustratively such as a group from a single network asset.  In some aspects, the step of determining dependencies between each vulnerability includes obtaining a set of relevant electronic observations
for the plurality of vulnerabilities.  Optionally, the step of identifying a plurality of vulnerabilities includes obtaining vulnerability data obtained from one or more vulnerability scanners.  A process optionally further includes generating
vulnerability-host information to associate each of the vulnerabilities with a host.  A process optionally further includes assigning initial scores to each of the vulnerabilities based on a vulnerability scoring system.  A vulnerability scoring system
is optionally the common vulnerability scoring system.  In some aspects, the assigning of initial scores to each of the vulnerabilities includes generating random numbers in an array of integer values, optionally creating a table of the vulnerabilities
with qualitative attributes; and optionally creating a table of the initial scores.  In some aspects, the step of creating a hidden Markov model includes using a conditional probability table of a Dirichlet distribution.  Optionally, the process further
includes iteratively repeating the step of creating a hidden Markov model to reduce the margin of errors of emission rates.  Optionally, the step of determining the exploit likelihood of each of the attack states at a first time includes using state
transition weights or probabilities of all incoming links of the attack state and calculating an impact of each attack state using the state transition weights or probabilities of outgoing links of each attack state.  Optionally, the step of determining
the exploit likelihood of each of the attack states includes considering weights of all incoming links; and determining the impact of each attack state by considering weights of all outgoing links.  Optionally, the step of determining the most probable
sequences or paths of attack states includes determining which of the vulnerabilities are exploited.  Optionally, the step of determining the most probable sequences or paths of attack states is determined using a Viterbi algorithm based on weights of
state transition links and observations.  In some aspects, a process further includes creating a coupled hidden Markov model at a second time, where the coupled hidden Markov model has as many chains as number of vulnerabilities such that each chain's
states represent the attack state of a distinct vulnerability.  In some aspects a process includes recursively creating a plurality of coupled hidden Markov models over a plurality of time slices subsequent to the second time to measure risk.  In some
aspects, a process further includes updating continuous state parameters corresponding to percentage of good, vulnerable and comprised nodes in a state space model of cyber systems using a Kalman filter to filter out noise in the computations of exploit
likelihood and impact of vulnerability exploitation, optionally by iteratively determining vulnerability dependencies based on the state space model.  Optionally, a process includes creating a second hidden Markov model representing an attack state of
each vulnerability of the plurality of vulnerabilities with vulnerability dependencies identified using the state space model; determining a second exploit likelihood of each of said attack states at a third time; determining the most probable sequences
or paths of attack states; and identifying dynamically the risk of one or more of said critical assets based on said sequences or paths of attack states.
<BR><BR> The processes are optionally employed on a specifically configured or purposed computer or computer system.  The processes are optionally performed by a coded non-transitory computer readable medium.  As such, also provided is a non-transient
computer readable medium for storing computer instructions that, when executed by at least one processor, causes the at least one processor to perform a process of dynamically assessing a risk or defending attack of one or more critical assets within a
network of electronically interconnected devices in real-time including: a code segment assigning vulnerability scores to a plurality of vulnerabilities identified within a network of electronically interconnected devices, where common vulnerability
scoring system is used to assign the initial vulnerability scores; and a code segment for recursively creating a hidden Markov model by enabling each hidden state to represent the attack state of one distinct vulnerability from said plurality of
vulnerabilities and observations. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<BR><BR> The following description of particular aspect(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the scope of the invention, its application, or uses, which may, of course, vary.  The invention is described with relation to the
non-limiting definitions and terminology included herein.  These definitions and terminology are not designed to function as a limitation on the scope or practice of the invention but are presented for illustrative and descriptive purposes only.  While

overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.
<BR><BR> Using prior systems, obtaining all required knowledge of cyber security events and activities within a network for assessing its cyber risk in real-time is extremely difficult due mainly to uncertainties or unexplained patterns of network
traffic, incomplete or noisy attack measurements and observations, and insufficient information about vulnerabilities and cyber assets.  The systems and methods provided herein dynamically build additional relationships and dependencies among detected
vulnerabilities and sensor measurements so that risk assessment can be achieved more accurately and in real-time by encoding the available quantitative and qualitative knowledge of vulnerabilities and exploits on integrated Markov, Bayesian, and state
space models.  The processes and systems provided are also expected to significantly enhance cyber resilience, agility, and detection operations of cyber security in part because their effective implementation utilizes real-time, dependable risk
assessment.
<BR><BR> The methods and systems provided herein progressively build as many relationships and dependencies as possible among detected vulnerabilities in a system or network and observations of sensor measurements.  The system then provides a novel way
of interpreting the transition/emission rates and parameters of these models in terms of cyber parameters and operations such as vulnerability, exploit likelihood and impact.  Specifically, the transition rates of outgoing and incoming links of states in
hidden and coupled Markov models are used in determining exploit likelihood and impact of attacks, while emission rates are used to help determine the attack states of vulnerabilities.  A state space model and Kalman filter are used to estimate the range
of changes in state variables, and then this information is fed as input to the Markov models as they are run optionally iteratively and in real-time.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "risk" is a function of: (1) a "cyber threat" exercising a set of potential "cyber vulnerabilities" on one or a set of "critical cyber assets" (CCA) supporting a "critical asset" (CA); and (2) the resulting impact of the
vulnerability on such critical asset (CA).
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "cyber threat" is any circumstance or event with the potential for a "threat source" to successfully compromise any exposed cyber vulnerabilities.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "threat source" or "attacker" is defined as a potential source, either human or technological, with the motivation, capability, and intent to cause harm to an infrastructure or other network of electronically
interconnected devices.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "vulnerability" is an inherent weakness in a critical cyber asset that could be exploited by a threat source.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "critical cyber assets" are network mutable electronic components that are part of control or data acquisition systems that monitor, manage or command operational equipment.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "critical asset" is defined as a physical component essential to the operation of the infrastructure.
<BR><BR> As used herein, the term "impact" is the magnitude of disruption that can be expected in terms of safety, economic, and mission to the infrastructure if critical asset is compromised.
<BR><BR> The processes provided herein are capable of real-time determinations of risk within critical infrastructure such as illustratively for public utilities (e.g., <B><I>electricity,</I></B> water, gas), national critical infrastructure protection (CIP) assets as
defined by the United States Department of Homeland Security, (e.g., bridges, roads), educational institutions and facilities (e.g., universities), and government agencies in the United States and from other nations.
<BR><BR> Areas for network vulnerabilities illustratively include data integrity, security, protocol encryption, authentication and device hardware.  Some specific examples include a lack of integrity checking of communication, ineffective network
security architectures, physical access to a device, and weaknesses in authentication process or authentication keys.
<BR><BR> Software and firmware design as well as their development and deployment can have vulnerabilities and of course, also result in or be the target of attacks.  Software and firmware development include vulnerabilities in code quality,
authentication, cryptography, general logic errors and password management.  Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) specification are used to establish a common identifier for vulnerability as well as some other descriptions from the Common Weakness
Enumeration (CWE) and vulnerability categories defined by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).
<BR><BR> Given N multi-stage vulnerabilities detected by a vulnerability scanner in a network, the provided methods and systems assess cyber risk of a network by quantifying the exploit likelihood and exploitation impact of all vulnerabilities within the
next k units of time based on all sensor measurements and observations in the network.  To assist in description, consider FIG. 1 depicting fourteen multi-stage vulnerabilities.  A vulnerability is termed a first-state vulnerability (e.g., V.sub.1,
V.sub.2) if it can be exploited directly by an attacker either internal to a network or accessing a network or node from an external location or device such as through the internet.  A vulnerability is termed a second-stage vulnerability (e.g., V.sub.3,
V.sub.4) if it can be exploited only after exploiting a first-stage vulnerability.  Similarly, the exploitation of a k-stage vulnerability can be triggered only after the exploitation of (k-1)-stage vulnerability.  In some aspects, a vulnerability is
itself a plurality of vulnerabilities.  As an example, an asset may be controlled by a system that itself includes a plurality of vulnerabilities where the asset may be connected to or integral to a larger system or network.  The processes as provided
optionally consider such a plurality of vulnerabilities on a single or group of assets a single vulnerability for purposes of the process when combined with other identified vulnerabilities outside the asset.  The number of vulnerabilities is not
limiting.
<BR><BR> The process of assessing risk according to some aspects as provided herein is illustrated by the flow chart of FIG. 2 and is optionally run on a computer system as a vulnerability assessment module.  The first step 201 considers all those
vulnerabilities detected by one or more vulnerability scanners in a given time interval whereby a vulnerability scanner or multiple vulnerability scanners are used to scan the network for vulnerabilities and output the results to a database.  A
vulnerability scanner output is one or more vulnerabilities detected by network- or host-based scanners.  An <B><I>intrusion detection system</I></B> (IDS) output is network- or host-based IDS alerts.  A network monitoring tool can generate packet capture (i.e., pcap)
data.  A port scanning tool results in port scanning data.  A firewall's rulesets constitute firewall information.  All these IDS alerts, pcap and port-scanning data, firewall rulesets, authentication and file access logs, open ports data, behavioral
analysis information of IDS tools, etc are observations of cyber sensors that help detect network and attacker activities and are used to identify the vulnerabilities.  The second step 202 builds a Bayesian graph to determine dependencies and
relationship among the vulnerabilities identified in the first step and then classifies the vulnerabilities into multi-stages.  The third step 203 assigns the initial vulnerability scores using CVSS attributes.  The fourth step 204 creates a HMM or
optionally a CHMM, such that every state of the HMM represents the attack state of a distinct vulnerability identified in the first step 201, and the relevant cyber observations and measurements correspond to the state's observation.  The fifth step 205
determines the initial probabilities of every state of HMM from the fourth step 204 using a Bayesian network and an appropriate distribution function, optionally a Dirichlet distribution.  The sixth step 206 repeats the run of HMM until the margin of
errors of transition and emission rates are acceptable.  A common platform such as Matlab is optionally used.  The seventh step 207 computes the exploit likelihood of each attack state by considering the weights of all of its incoming links (i.e., all of
its incoming state transition probabilities) and calculates the impact of each attack state by considering the weights of all the outgoing links (i.e., all of its outgoing state transition probabilities).  The eighth step determines the most probable
paths of attack states of HMM representing those vulnerabilities to be exploited.  The ninth step 209 reruns and analyses steps of steps 204-208 recursively over time using a CHMM with two or more time slices or dynamic Bayesian network (DBN).  From the
preceding nine steps, step 10 assess the risk for use in mission assurance and resilience.  A risk assessment is optionally output to a display that illustrates the risk assessment to a user or operator.  In optional aspects, a Kalman filter shown in
FIG. 7B is provided to update continuous state parameters G, V, and C of the state space model, shown in FIG. 7A corresponding to the percentage of good, vulnerable and compromised nodes, respectively, using the exploit likelihood and impact parameters
of HMM or CHMM that are obtained in the current risk assessment.  This updated data is used to update the state parameters used in determining vulnerability dependencies used to repeat the process beginning at step 201.  The recursive nature of the
system in real-time serves to improve risk assessment throughout the network as new vulnerabilities are identified and attack states change.
<BR><BR> A process may be run in a vulnerability assessment module as a form of software implemented on a computer system that optionally runs as a stand-alone system or as a component of a network of electronically interconnected computer systems.  An
illustrative computer system 301 for operating a vulnerability assessment module is illustrated in FIG. 3.  The computer system 301 is connected either directly or via a network 302 to one or more CCAs that are either directly connected to each other or
via a network.  In some aspects, the computer system 301 is itself a CCA, is a remote system, or is a portion of a CCA.  The computer system employs a vulnerability scanner 303 such as any scanner software known in the art.  The vulnerability scanner is
optionally a software component of the computer system itself, is housed on a separate computer system in electronic communication with the computer system, or is optionally housed on one or more CCAs.  It is appreciated that more than one vulnerability
scanner may be used and may be housed at any location with a connection to one or more CCAs and the computer system 301.  The computer system 301 monitors the plurality of CCAs on the network by use of the vulnerability scanner or receives vulnerability
data (e.g. IDS alerts, pcap and port-scanning data, firewall rulesets, authentication and file access logs, open ports data, behavioral analysis information of IDS tools, etc.) from one or more vulnerability scanners through the use of the vulnerability
assessment module 304.  The vulnerability assessment module is optionally a continually run process or is run on demand initiated either by user input or by receipt of a new time slice of information, or from receipt of one or more vulnerabilities from a
vulnerability scanner.  Optionally, a vulnerability assessment module is run when one or more CCAs are added to or removed from a network.
<BR><BR> The computer system 301 comprises a processor 305, various support circuits 306, and memory 307.  The processor 305 may include one or more microprocessors such as known in the art.  The support circuits 306 for the processor 305 include
conventional cache, <B><I>power</I></B> supplies, clock circuits, data registers, I/O interface 308, and the like.  The I/O interface 308 may be directly coupled to the memory 307 or coupled through the support circuits 306.  The I/O interface 308 may also be
configured for communication with input devices and/or output devices such as network devices, various storage devices, mouse, keyboard, display, video and audio sensors, IMU, RF receivers and RF transmitters or the like.  Those of ordinary skill in the
art will recognize that the computer system 301 may be coupled to other computer systems to form a larger computer network.
<BR><BR> The memory 307, or a computer readable medium, stores non-transient processor executable instructions and/or data that may be executed by and/or used by the processor 305.  These processor-executable instructions may include firmware, software,
and the like, or some combination thereof.  Modules having processor-executable instructions that are stored in the memory 307 comprise a vulnerability assessment module 304.
<BR><BR> The computer system 301 may be programmed with one or more operating systems, which may include OS/2, Java Virtual Machine, Linux, SOLARIS, UNIX, HPUX, AFX, WINDOWS, IOS, and ANDROID, among other known platforms.  The memory 307 may include one
or more of random access memory, read only memory, magneto-resistive read/write memory, optical read/write memory, cache memory, magnetic read/write memory, and the like, as well as signal-bearing media.
<BR><BR> To further describe the processes provided herein, each step of FIG. 2 will be described in greater detail.  Block 201 represents a consideration of a set of vulnerabilities detected by vulnerability scanner.  Vulnerability scanners are software
based, hardware based, or both.  Illustrative examples of a vulnerability scanner can be found from Tenable Network Security as the Nessus vulnerability scanner.  At step 201, the number of vulnerabilities at every stage are determined using a Poisson
random process where the Poisson mean arrival rate, .lamda., is made equal to the number of detected vulnerabilities at time t.
<BR><BR> At step 202 the process determines and represents dependencies among given vulnerabilities using a Bayesian network illustratively as depicted in FIG. 2B.  If vulnerability scanner dataset/results are provided, construct a vulnerability graph of
N vulnerabilities using their CVE, CVSS information as well as other available information such as topology and hosts.  If, however, a vulnerability scanner dataset is not provided, then generate/predict vulnerability-host information in order to
associate vulnerabilities with some hosts.  Then create a directed acyclic graph of the number of hosts and number of attacker machines.  A table is then created of the associativity of the vulnerabilities and/or hosts to identify and organize the
vulnerabilities per dependencies among them.  The detected vulnerabilities are thereby organized by dependencies throughout the network or system.  Such a set of known interrelated relationships functions to categorize each recognized vulnerability
according to risk of attack either directly or through another vulnerability.  For example, a first stage vulnerability can be directly accessed through a gateway to an external environment such as the internet without the requirement for intermediate
access through another vulnerability in the system.  A second stage vulnerability is accessible only through prior access by a first stage vulnerability such that to access the second stage vulnerability two vulnerabilities must be exploited to form an
effective attack toward the second stage vulnerability.  The number of vulnerability stages is defined by the network and relationships between the established vulnerabilities and is not externally limited.
<BR><BR> At the third stage, initial scores are assigned to each vulnerability in block 203 using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) that provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities.  The
CVSS is made up of three main metric groups and each consisting with a set of metrics for calculating the vulnerability score that include metrics for base, temporal and environmental.  It is not required to evaluate all three metric groups.  Optionally,
the base score can be refined by assigning values to the temporal and environmental metrics.  Depending on the type of assessment required, the base score calculation and vector may be sufficient.  Mell P, Scarfone K, Romanosky.  "The Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and its Applicability to Federal Agency Systems," NISTIR 7435, August 2007.  Additional specific description of determining scores from the CVSS system can be found in U.S.  Patent Application Publication No:
2014/0137257.  The vulnerability score will range from 0 to 10.  An exemplary process for this is illustrated at FIG. 2C and at step 203.  Each of the vulnerabilities is assigned scores of base, impact, temporal exploitability, access vector, access
complexity, authentication, confimpact, integimpact, availimpact, remediation level, report confidence, collateral damage potential, target distribution, among others if desired.  These numbers are then organized into an array of integers with the
dimensions of the array representing the vulnerabilities and scores.  A table of the vulnerabilities with qualitative attributes is then generated.  Finally, a table of the vulnerabilities and their assigned CVSS scores is generated.
<BR><BR> The fourth step illustrated at 204 is the creation of an HMM that represents the attack state of each vulnerability that was previously identified.  FIG. 4 illustrates a basic HMM for a single vulnerability.  In FIG. 4 shaded nodes represent
observations and unshaded nodes are hidden states such as those derived from IDS alerts, scan reports, pcap data, among others.  HMM includes unobserved (hidden) states that are not directly visible to observer, but (noisy) output is visible.  A sequence
of emissions is observed, without knowing what sequence of states has generated them.  Thus, at time 1, the single random variable of HMM represents system exploit status and has as many attack states as the number of vulnerabilities.  The HMM is run
where the number of observations equals the number of vulnerabilities, k, where each observation is relevant to a distinct vulnerability.  The number of states is equal to k+1, where state 1 represents the normal state with no vulnerability exploitation,
while state i for i&gt;1 represents the exploitation of any i-1 vulnerabilities.  The attack state values, however, vary because they depend on the particular properties of the vulnerabilities.  There are 2k+1 nodes in the HMM.
<BR><BR> As a more detailed example, consider the condition of a network with four identified vulnerabilities labeled V1 to V4, respectively.  Using an analogous numerology to FIG. 4, X1, X2, X3, X4 represent the attack states of vulnerabilities V1, V2,
V3, and V4, respectively.  Further, Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4 represent (noisy) observations of each of the four vulnerabilities, respectively.  Outgoing link rates (transition rates) of state Xi are a function of the impact of Xi's exploitation, and incoming link
rates of state Xi are a function of the exploit likelihood of Xi's vulnerability.  The observation symbol probability distribution, B, depends on how well observation characteristics match with vulnerability signature (conditions).  The state transition
probability distribution, A, is determined by random selection processes associated with vulnerabilities, depending on their relationships; for instance, a next-state selection process could be rolling a die with different probabilities at each side. 
Finally, the initial state distribution, c, is determined by the statistical exploitability data of first-stage vulnerabilities.
<BR><BR> With four given observations, a model can be formed as illustrated in FIG. 5A.  From these observations and arrangement in the HMM, the most probable path of true attack states can be determined 207, 208.  As illustrated in FIG. 2E, step 207 is
achieved by gathering all the evidences or observations.  The posterior distributions of all HMM states are determined using marginal distribution on a single node as well as joint distributions on a set of nodes based on the evidences gathered.  The
weights of all incoming links are then used to compute the exploit likelihood of each HMM.  Similarly, the weights of all the outgoing links are used to compute the impact of each HMM state.  These exploit likelihoods and weights of the outgoing links
are then used in step 208 as illustrated in FIG. 2F where Bayesian reasoning is used to predict which of the vulnerabilities are exploited.  From this, a Viterbi algorithm is used to determine the most probable paths of attack states.
<BR><BR> As a further example of steps 207 and 208, for a given sequence of observations at four different slices of time (t=1 to 4) representing observations Y1, Y3, Y4, Y2, respectively, the probability of ending up in state j at time t is equal to
(Probability of ending up in state i at time t-1)*(Transition rate from state i to j)*(Probability of observation at time t).  At time t=1, the observation Y1 has the highest vulnerability exploitation distribution or probability on state X1 and,
therefore, the attack path starts in state X1.  At time t=2, the observation Y3 is obtained, with the distributions of 0.2 and 0.5 on states X1 and X2, respectively.  Now, as it follows from the above formula, state X1 can either self-transition to
itself with probability (0.7.times.0.4.times.0.2=0.056), or transition to X2 with probability (0.7.times.0.6.times.0.5=0.21).  This latter option is taken by X1 since 0.21 is larger than 0.056.  Next, at time t=3 with observation Y4, state X2 can either
self-transition to itself with probability (0.21.times.0.7.times.0.6=0.088), or transition to X3 with probability (0.21.times.0.3.times.0.4=0.025).  This first option is taken by X2 since 0.088 is larger than 0.025.  Finally, at time t=4 with observation
Y2, state X2 can either self-transition to itself with probability (0.088.times.0.7.times.0=0), or transition to X3 with probability (0.088.times.0.3.times.0.9=0.024).  This latter option is taken by X2 since 0.024 is larger than 0.  Thus, the most
probable sequence or path of attack states is X1, X2, X2, X3 (using Modified Viterbi Decoding) as is depicted in FIG. 5B.  This sequence of attack states is obtained when the HMM is used, indicating the sequence of vulnerabilities V1, V2, and V3 to be
exploited most probably.  Once these vulnerabilities are identified, then the exploit likelihood and impact of each vulnerability are computed based on the incoming and outgoing transition probabilities or weights of their attack states, leading to their
risk assessment.
<BR><BR> In some aspects, the vulnerabilities and observations that are used in the HMM simulation is rerun recursively over time using a coupled hidden Markov model (CHMM) as is indicated in step 209.  In a CHMM, each hidden variable interacts locally
with its neighboring hidden variables while each hidden node has its own observation.  In the processes provided herein, each chain represents a random variable corresponding to the exploit status of distinct vulnerability.  An exemplary CHMM is depicted
in FIG. 7.  Determining the most probable multiple paths of true attack states in CHMM is illustrated in FIG. 7A by the exemplary situation as per above where X1, X2, X3, X4 are CHMM chains, where X.sub.i represents attack state of V.sub.i (the i.sup.th
variable).  Each chain X.sub.i has its own observation Y.sub.i.  FIG. 7A illustrates a CHMM model with exemplary observations at three different time slices illustrated in FIG. 7B.
<BR><BR> The output of the recursively run HMM and CHMM provides a measure of risk that can be used in determining mission resilience and assurance.  Specifically, the identification and sequence of attack states indicate the identity and sequence of
vulnerabilities to be exploited most probably.  Then, the exploit likelihood and impact of each vulnerability to be exploited most probably are computed based on the incoming and outgoing transition probabilities or weights of their attack states,
leading to their risk assessment.
<BR><BR> In some aspects, the state space model created at step 202 is reassessed using a Kalman filter to update continuous state parameters corresponding to the percentage of good, vulnerable and compromised nodes, as illustrated in FIG. 7A and FIG.
7B.  The updated state parameters may then be used in determining vulnerability dependencies for use in a following iterative process as described herein.  By using a series of (Gaussian) noisy and inaccurate measurements observed over time, the Kalman
filter produces a statistically optimal estimate of underlying system state such that the estimates of unknown variables tend to be more precise than those based on a single measurement alone.  Due to the recursive nature of the Kalman filter algorithm,
it can run in real-time using only the present input measurements and the previously calculated state and its uncertainty matrix.
<BR><BR> As an example to ease the presentation of using Kalman filter for estimating system state variables, we will consider only the following three system state variables, namely, G(t), V(t), and C(t) that represent the percentage of good,
vulnerable, and compromised assets, respectively at time t. Because it is very difficult to observe all events of a cybersecurity environment due to various reasons, the above system state variables are estimated.  Therefore, the input of the Kalman
filter algorithm is a set of sensor measurements and a linear Gaussian state space model.  The outputs of the algorithm are estimates of the system state variables G(t), V(t), and C(t).
<BR><BR> To model a cyber-physical system using the linear/non-linear time-invariant systems, we consider a network or system of N assets or nodes, where N(t)=G(t)+V(t)+C(t), and N(t) is the total percentage of nodes in the system at time t, G(t) denote
the percentage of those nodes that do not have any known vulnerability at time t, V(t) denotes the percentage of those nodes that have some known vulnerabilities at time t, but are not exploited yet, and C(t) denotes the percentage of those nodes that
are compromised partially/fully through the exploitation of their vulnerabilities.  The cybersecurity environment of a cyber-physical system can be modeled as a linear system.  An exemplary cybersecurity model with linear system equations for such a
system is illustrated in FIG. 8.  In this model, let R(t): recovery support services rate; P(t): patching support services rate; o(t.sub.0): vulnerability occurrence rate; p(t.sub.0): vulnerability patching rate; e(t.sub.0): vulnerability exploitability
rate, and r(t.sub.0): compromised systems recovery rate.  P(t) and R(t) denote the inputs based on recovery and patching support operations, respectively.  Also, let C(t) and V(t) denote the outputs that can be measured.  Then, the system can be
described as follows: {acute over (x)}(t)={acute over (G)}(t),{acute over (V)}(t),{acute over (C)}(t)) u(t)=(P(t),R(t)) y(t)=(C(t),V(t)) Differential equations of the (simplified) model shown can be written as {acute over (G)}(t)=pV(t)-oG(t) {acute over
(V)}(t)=oG(t)+rC(t)-pV(t)-eV(t)+P(t) {acute over (C)}(t)=eV(t)-rC(t)+R(t) Assuming that system state variables G(t), V(t), C(t), E(t), and F(t) are linear, the system state can be expressed using the first-order linear differential equations as follows:
<BR><BR> .times..function..function..times..function..function..function..function- ..function..function..function..function..function..function..times..funct- ion..function..function..function..function..function.  ##EQU00001## These equations can also
be expressed in discrete time as follows:
<BR><BR> .times..function..function..times..function.  ##EQU00002##
<BR><BR> For estimating the system state variables G.sub.n, V.sub.n and C.sub.n representing the percentage of good, vulnerable and compromised assets, respectively, using Kalman filter, in one example, we consider a three-dimensional linear Gaussian
state space model, where u.sub.k is ignored for simplicity and M=D=3.  x.sub.n=F.sub.nx.sub.n-1+v.sub.n y.sub.n=H.sub.nx.sub.n+w.sub.n where F.sub.n is the D.times.D state-transition matrix, v.sub.n is a D.times.1 Gaussian random state noise vector with
zero mean and covariance matrix Q.sub.n, H.sub.n is the M.times.D measurement matrix, and w.sub.n is a M.times.1 Gaussian random measurement noise vector with zero mean and covariance matrix R.sub.n.  This Gaussian space model can be used to express our
system state and output equations as:
<BR><BR> .function.  ##EQU00003## The state vector x.sub.n=[G.sub.n V.sub.n C.sub.n].sup.T is three dimensional.  Based on the calculations of e(V.sub.i) and r(V.sub.i) in the previous section, along with the previous measurements of p and o, let e=0.05,
r=0.01, p=0.10, and o=0.15.  Thus, the state transition matrix Fn is written as:
<BR><BR> ##EQU00004## and the state noise vector v.sub.n=[v.sub.n,1 v.sub.n,2 v.sub.n,3].sup.T is 3.times.1 and Gaussian with zero mean and covariance matrix
<BR><BR> .sigma..function.  ##EQU00005## We obtain noisy measurements of G.sub.n, V.sub.n and C.sub.n, so that we can express the measurement process as
<BR><BR> .function.  ##EQU00006## where the measurement noise vector w.sub.n=[w.sub.n,1 w.sub.n,2 w.sub.n,3]T is 3.times.1 and Gaussian with zero mean and covariance matrix
<BR><BR> .sigma..function.  ##EQU00007## Also, note that the measurement matrix H.sub.n is the 3.times.3 identity matrix.  We developed a script in Matlab to estimate the percentage of good, vulnerable, and compromised assets, denoted by G.sub.n, V.sub.n
and C.sub.n, using the Kalman filter.  Hence, the Kalman filter provides a better estimate of the system state variables G.sub.n, V.sub.n and C.sub.n after some parameters of the above state equations such as exploit likelihood e and vulnerability
occurrence rate o are updated with their new values obtained through HMM or CHMM.
<BR><BR> Some aspects include determining the magnitude of risk associated with any one or collection of vulnerabilities of the network as a whole, optionally assigning a risk score, and optionally displaying a risk score, identified vulnerabilities, or
combinations thereof on a monitor or other display apparatus.  With respect to determining if the risk level is high in decision block 210 of FIG. 2A, the magnitude of the risk is evaluated to determine if the risk is high on a critical asset.  This
consists of the consolidation of multiple risks on a critical asset.  If risk is high, then a further optional step of identifying and evaluating security countermeasures to mitigate risk may be performed.  General security countermeasures are applied to
critical assets with a low risk.
<BR><BR> According to some aspects, a process includes identifying and evaluating strategies, treatments, or security countermeasures to reduce or eliminate the identified risk.  Risks can be managed by one of four distinct methods: risk acceptance, risk
avoidance, risk control, or risk transfer.  Department of Homeland Security, "Risk Management Fundamentals," April 2011.  Risk acceptance is defined as an explicit or implicit decision not to take an action that would affect a particular risk.  Risk
avoidance is defined as a strategy or measure which effectively removes the exposure of an organization to a risk.  Risk control is defined as any of one or more deliberate actions taken to reduce a risk's potential for harm or maintain the risk at an
acceptable level.  Finally, risk transfer is defined as shifting some or all of the risk to another entity, asset, system, network, or geographic area.  Any one or more of these recognized countermeasures may be taken in response to assessment of risk
according to the processes provided herein.  The use of any one or more of the foregoing countermeasures are optionally necessitated or directed by the current assessment of risk in the network at any particular time.  Following a countermeasure, the
process of assessing risk is optionally performed using a new vulnerability identification and mapping and processing according to the vulnerability assessment module and processes as provided to assess risk under the new state of the network.
<BR><BR> The processes herein provide a systematic and comprehensive approach for assessing cyber risk of a system in real-time as long as vulnerability scanners and network defense sensors provide continuously credible observations and measurements of
network and hosts such as vulnerability detections, intrusion alerts, flow and pcap (packet capture) data of network traffic, authentication and file access logs, open ports data, behavioral analysis results of intrusion detection tools, and firewall
rulesets.
<BR><BR> In addition, the processes consider not only atomic attacks or single-stage attacks but also multi-stage attacks that exploit the inter-dependent vulnerabilities between hosts.  This type of analysis is expected to provide better cyber defense
against attacks, and to determine more accurately the operational status of systems and particular hosts.  Determining individual vulnerabilities of nodes is the first necessary step in computing their security levels.  One standard technique for
measuring individual vulnerabilities is called Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).  After vulnerabilities and threats are measured individually, they need to be measured collectively by taking their relationships and combined impact on
compromising resources.  Bayesian network and attack graphs are employed mostly to encode the relationships and dependencies among vulnerabilities, threats, attacks, and/or exploits.  Bayesian network serves as a good belief model tool for data rich
domains like threat detection by providing an efficient evidence propagation mechanism and powerful reasoning capability.
<BR><BR> Various aspects of the present invention are illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.  The examples are for illustrative purposes and are not a limitation on any practice of the present invention.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLES
<BR><BR> A Matlab simulator is developed to implement every step of the method by developing custom programs, along with the open-source Bayesian Network Toolbox.  The objective is to consider vulnerabilities of a real network detected by a vulnerability
scanner, while obtaining observations from real data of network intrusions, firewalls, and other sensor measurements.  While this system and method may be used to parse real vulnerability and netDefense data, the following examples were conducted using
synthetic data.  The coded process assessing risk for an exemplary set of synthetic data representing 14 identified vulnerabilities is illustrated in Appendix A with the Kalman filter process illustrated in Appendix B.
<BR><BR> The first step is to consider all those vulnerabilities detected by one or more vulnerability scanners in a given time interval.  The synthetic data used in this example identified 14 vulnerabilities using the Nessus vulnerability scanner.  The
dependencies and relationship among these vulnerabilities are assessed by calculating their Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) attributes as is achieved using the National Vulnerability Database from the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.  The identified vulnerabilities are depicted in FIG. 9 and CVSS scores of the exemplary data as calculated by the system are illustrated in FIG. 10.
<BR><BR> The vulnerabilities were then classified into multi-stages and Bayesian graph constructed to represent them.  Observation data is obtained in the form of IDS alerts log, firewall log, or pcap data in two time intervals.  A start state, labeled
node 1, is added to the HMM, and this observation data is associated with each of the vulnerabilities and labeled to have more realistic transition matrices during HMM training.
<BR><BR> A (Bayesian) hidden Markov model and a (Dynamic Bayesian) coupled hidden Markov model are constructed whose states represent attack states of vulnerabilities, while the observations of these models correspond to the collected observation data. 
FIG. 12 illustrates the relationships between the vulnerabilities and the observation data where the 14 vulnerabilities are represented by attack state nodes labeled 2-15 (due to the newly added start state labeled as node 1) and the observations are
labeled 16-30.  All attack states and the start state together represent the system state at time t. The HMM models were trained by initializing their transition and emission matrices with the Bayesian posterior distributions and evidences, and then
determining the sequence of "true" attack states to quantify system risk by considering exploit likelihood and impact of all true attack states.
<BR><BR> The transition matrices of HMM and Coupled HMM (based on two-slice dynamic Bayesian network) ware initialized with the estimated conditional probability distributions of the Bayesian network built for the given vulnerabilities, while the
emission matrices of HMM are initialized with the sensors' observations (e.g., IDS alerts, firewall log).  Then, they are "trained" by iterating recursively as new evidences/observations of sensors arrive in. At the end of these iterations (for example,
after 500 or 1000 iterations) of HMM matrices, the attack impact of an HMM state is determined as a factor of its outgoing transition rates, while the exploit likelihood of an HMM state is computed as a factor of its incoming transition rates, where each
HMM state corresponds to the potential exploitation of a distinct vulnerability.  The coupled HMM at time t and t+1 are illustrated in FIG. 13.  In the figure at t=1 the attack states of CHMM are labeled 1 to 14 and the observations are labeled 15 to 28. Slice 2 is obtained at time t+1 where the slice 2 attack states are labeled 29 to 42 and observations are labeled 43 to 56.  All (28) attack states together represent the system state at two time slices (e.g., time t and time t+1); hence, system states
at t and t+1 have 28 attack states, where CHMM has 14 chains, each corresponding to a distinct random variable that represent the attack states of a distinct vulnerability.  Attack state k of slice 1 is connected to slice 1's observation k+14 and slice
2's attack state k+28.  The accumulated risk scores of attack states in HMM+ are shown when the experimental data simulator results in the attack state sequence of the vulnerabilities to be exploited most probably: [6 9 14 1 2 10 14 1 2 10 14 1 4 10],
which is a vector of true attack states as illustrated in FIG. 14.  The accumulated risk scores of attack states in the HMM+ with respect to time are shown in FIG. 15 when experimental data simulator results in the state sequence: [6 9 14 1 2 10 14 1 2
10 14 1 4 10], which is a vector of true attack states.
