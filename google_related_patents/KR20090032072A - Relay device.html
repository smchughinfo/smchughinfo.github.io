    <invention-title lang="EN">Relay device</invention-title>
    <technical-field>
      <p num="1">The present invention relates to a relay apparatus which is very suitable for use in communicating electronicized information by adding an encryption function to, for example, a TCP or UDP protocol located in a transport layer. Specifically, it is intended to prevent &#34;leakage&#34; and &#34;falsifying&#34; or &#34;fake&#34;, &#34;entrance&#34; or &#34;attack&#34; of data on a security system in communication, especially on the Internet.</p>
    </technical-field>
    <background-art>
      <p num="2">The inventor of the present invention decides encryption / decryption logic on the sending side and the receiving side in order to enhance the prevention of data leakage, forgery, forgery, entry, and attack without first changing the program of the upper application. There is provided a novel encryption system TCP 2 (International Publication No. WO 2005/015827 A1 pamphlet: hereinafter referred to as Patent Document 1) which is applied to the payload of a protocol corresponding to TCP or UDP present in the transport layer. .</p>
      <p num="3">In recent years, communication using the Internet is rapidly spreading in society because anyone who can access a computer on the network only needs to connect it to a network as long as there is a Windows PC. In addition, with the spread of Internet communication, hackers and crackers are also invading other computer systems, stealing software and data, and forging or destroying them. .</p>
      <p num="4">As a specific case of tampering, first of all, there is a system disturbance that sends a large amount of messages from the network and prevents the operation of the computer system so that the central system cannot be used. This interruption can also cause the system to crash if the host becomes overloaded.</p>
      <p num="5">In addition, there is an illegal interference of &#34;unauthorized access and forgery&#34;, such as illegally obtaining a host&#39;s password, stealing confidential information, or forging or destroying information. There is also a mean to this disruption, which involves rewriting the information the computer holds and putting people in trouble. In addition, fraudulent acts called spyware that infiltrate certain PCs and exploit personal confidential data such as e-mail addresses and passwords have also occurred. In this way, it is impossible to deny the possibility that so-called eavesdropping is frequently performed, which illegally steals the contents of the database of the computer connected to the network.</p>
      <p num="6">In addition, it is impossible to say that there is no crisis such as cyber terrorism caused by intentionally stealing personal information or stealing in-house as an operator of a site or a server.</p>
      <p num="7">In addition, there has been an increase in the number of fraudulent interferences such as sending &#34;viruses&#34; to other people&#39;s computers. The PC which used e-mail at home is infected by this sent virus, and the whole PC in the company is infected at the moment when it is connected in-house, the virus destroys the file in the computer, or the whole network is brought down, There is also a problem.</p>
      <p num="8">For this reason, IPsec (IP) is a function that prevents &#34;leakage&#34;, &#34;forgery&#34;, and the like of data in communication over the Internet using the conventional Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP / IP) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol). Sec: Cryptographic communication called Security Architecture for Internet Protocol (SSL) or Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is used.</p>
      <p num="9">In general, encryption communication includes a common key (also called a secret key) encryption method and a public key encryption method, but IPsec uses a common key encryption method in many cases. Common key cryptography is characterized by faster encryption and decryption than public key cryptography. The common key cryptography method used for this IPsec is a method in which encryption and decryption are performed with the same key, and a key may be generated on either the sending side or the receiving side. Care must be taken to ensure that the contents do not leak out when exchanging keys.</p>
      <p num="10">The algorithm used for common key cryptography is DES (Data Encryption Standard), a common key (secret key) encryption algorithm developed by IBM IBM. IPsec also employs this DES as an encryption algorithm. IPsec is standardized by the Internet Engineer Task Force (IETF), and this feature is not only encrypting a specific application but also encrypts all communication transmitted from the host at the IP level.</p>
      <p num="11">This allows the user to enable secure communication without being aware of the application. In addition, IPsec makes it possible to change the encryption algorithm to be used without changing its own structure so that it can be used in the future. As a common cryptographic key used in IPsec, a 32-bit correspondence called SPI (Security Pointer Index) is used. As a key exchange protocol, IKE (Internet Key Exchange) is used. IPsec also has a protocol Authentication Header (AH) for integrity authentication.</p>
      <p num="12">In addition, SSL is an HTTP protocol with security functions developed by US Netscape (currently merged with AOL). By using this, clients and servers can authenticate each other on the network. It is possible to encrypt and send high information. This can prevent data eavesdropping, resending attacks (attacks that repeatedly intercept data that flows on the network and send them repeatedly), forgery (communicating as a person), and forgery of data.</p>
      <p num="13">Fig. 6 (a) shows an example of a protocol stack in the case of performing the encrypted communication using conventional IPsec, and Fig. 6 (b) shows an example of the protocol stack in the case of performing the encrypted communication using the conventional SSL.</p>
      <p num="14">In the OSI reference model, the lowest layer (first layer) is the physical layer, the second layer is the data link layer, the third layer is the network layer, the fourth layer is the transport layer, the fifth layer is the session layer, and the sixth layer is the presentation layer. The uppermost layer (seventh layer) is the application layer. In the OSI reference model, the seventh layer is divided into seven levels of communication functions, and standard function modules are determined for each layer. In Fig. 6A, up to the session layer of the fifth layer is shown. The protocol stack is a group of software that selects a protocol for realizing functions in each layer of the network and stacks it in a hierarchical form.</p>
      <p num="15">First, the outline of the OSI reference model will be described. The physical layer of the first layer is a layer defining physical electrical characteristics of a signal line, a modulation method of a code, and the like. However, this layer alone is rarely defined and implemented, and is usually defined as, for example, an Ethernet standard and the like together with the data link layer of the second layer.</p>
      <p num="16">The data link layer of the second layer is a layer defining data packetization, physical node address, packet transmission / reception method, and the like. This layer defines a protocol for exchanging packets between two nodes via a physical communication medium, assigns an address to each node, specifies the destination of the packet based on the address, and specifies the packet. Send on the communication medium.</p>
      <p num="17">As a communication medium, there exist various things, such as copper wiring, wireless, and an optical fiber. In addition, there are many types of connection forms (topologies), such as bus-type, star-type, and ring-type as well as one-to-one opposing connections. The packet transmitted on the communication medium is received by the node when it arrives at the receiving node and passed to the upper protocol layer.</p>
      <p num="18">The NIC (Network Interface Card) driver disposed through the physical layer and the data link layer is an expansion board for connecting a PC or a printer to a local area network (LAN). Often just a network card is on the ethernet.</p>
      <p num="19">This NIC driver allows a node (device) to transmit data to monitor the cable vacancy and to start transmission when the cable is empty. At this time, if a plurality of nodes start transmitting at the same time, data collides and is destroyed in the cable, so that both of them stop transmitting and wait for a random time to resume transmission. This allows a plurality of nodes to share a cable and communicate with each other.</p>
      <p num="20">The network layer of the third layer is a layer that defines a communication method between any two nodes. Speaking of TCP / IP, it corresponds to the IP layer. In the data link layer, although communication can be performed between nodes on the same network medium, it is this network that uses the function to communicate while routing between any two nodes existing on the network. It is the role of the floor.</p>
      <p num="21">Here, routing means selecting and transmitting an optimal path when transmitting a packet to a target host in a TCP / IP network. For example, in Ethernet, only nodes on the same segment can communicate with each other, but in the network layer, communication is performed by routing a packet between two Ethernet segments.</p>
      <p num="22">Also, it is possible to route packets regardless of the physical network medium, such as routing to a dial-up Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) line that connects a computer to a network (Ethernet) through a telephone line, or to a dedicated line using optical fiber. Can be rooted. For this purpose, an address (IP address, in case of TCP / IP) that does not depend on a physical medium is usually assigned to each node, and routing is performed based on this.</p>
      <p num="23">IPsec encrypts all communication transmitted from the host at this network layer, i.e., at the IP level, so that the user can enable secure communication without being aware of the application.</p>
      <p num="24">The transport layer of the fourth layer is a layer that provides a function for communicating between two processes running on each node, and is a protocol layer. Speaking of TCP / IP, TCP is equivalent to this. In addition, although the network layer provides a function for communicating between two nodes, it is the role of TCP to provide a virtual communication path without error between two processes (applications) using this.</p>
      <p num="25">In other words, data can be sent at the network layer, but there is no guarantee that the data will reach the other party. There is also no guarantee that the data will arrive correctly in the order in which they were sent. Thus, to make it easy to use in an application, it is TCP that provides an error free communication path. If necessary, the data is resent and recovered.</p>
      <p num="26">In addition to TCP, UDP is also provided in this transport layer. However, the difference between UDP and TCP is that the protocol is the data-compensated protocol, which is slower than the UDP. Is the point. TCP is mainly used for data transmission, such as communication between computers, and UDP is frequently used for voice and video transmission, such as IP telephones. This communication system is proposed by the inventor of the present invention in Patent Document 1 for the first time.</p>
      <p num="27">The session layer of the fifth layer is a layer that defines the order of sessions (from start to end of communication), and is a layer in which a connection can be established and communicated between applications. A socket disposed in this layer means a network address which combines an IP address corresponding to an address in a network owned by a computer and a port number that is a subaddress of the IP address.</p>
      <p num="28">When connecting computers, a socket (group of IP addresses and port numbers) must be specified. As shown in Fig. 6 (b), SSL, which is a typical representative encryption communication technology, realizes encrypted communication at this session layer.</p>
      <p num="29">The presentation layer of the sixth layer is a layer that defines a method of expressing data, encoding, encryption, and the like exchanged in a session (from start to end of communication). In the TCP / IP protocol, there is no equivalent to this layer, and the application itself usually handles the processing of the stream data.</p>
      <p num="30">In addition, the application layer of the seventh layer is a layer for specifying data exchange between applications, and there is no part corresponding to this layer in the TCP / IP protocol. For example, it is a layer that defines a common data structure and the like required for exchanging data between applications such as an electronic mail format and a document internal structure.</p>
      <p num="31">Fig. 6A is a standard protocol stack equipped with IPsec, but first, a NIC (Network Interface Card) driver is provided in the physical layer (first layer) and data link layer (second layer). This driver is a driver for an interface card for connecting hardware such as a computer to a network, and the contents thereof are data transmission and reception control software. For example, a LAN board or LAN card for connecting to Ethernet corresponds to this.</p>
      <p num="32">In the network layer of the third layer, there is an IP emulator in which part has grown up to the transport layer (fourth layer). The function as a transport is not implemented in the part extended to this transport layer. It merely provides the network layer&#39;s functionality to the session layer. This IP emulator functions to switch between IP protocol-encrypted communication by IPsec and IP which does not perform encrypted communication, depending on the purpose.</p>
      <p num="33">In addition, an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is arranged in the network layer of the third layer. This ARP is a protocol used to obtain a MAC (Media Access Control) address, which is an Ethernet physical address, from an IP address. MAC is a transmission control technique used in a LAN or the like called media access control, and is used as a technique for specifying a method of transmitting / receiving a frame, a format of a frame, correction of errors, or the like, which is a data transmission / reception unit.</p>
      <p num="34">In addition, this network layer includes a group of hosts configured to efficiently deliver or receive the same data to or from a plurality of hosts, such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), which is a protocol for transmitting IP error messages and control messages. IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) is installed. TCP and UDP are arranged in the transport layer, which is the upper layer of the network layer, and a socket interface is arranged in the session layer, which is the upper layer.</p>
      <p num="35">6B is an example of a standard protocol provided with SSL as an encryption processing protocol, and SSL is mounted in a socket (session layer) instead of mounting IPsec in the network layer. Other protocols are as shown in Fig. 6 (a).</p>
      <p num="36">In the typical typical encryption communication technology, IPsec encrypts and receives IP packets, and therefore, application software using higher protocols such as TCP and UDP need not be aware that IPsec is being used.</p>
      <p num="37">In SSL, a digital certificate using RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman: 3 initial developers of public key cryptography) public key cryptography is used at each authentication level, and common key cryptography such as DES is used for data encryption. Is used. Since this SSL is in the session layer of the fifth layer, it depends on the specific application.</p>
      <p num="38">IPsec is realized as a function of preventing &#34;leakage&#34; and &#34;forgery&#34; of data in the third layer (network layer) that is lower than the fourth layer (transport layer) in OSI (R. Atkinson, 1995). See Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol, RFC1825, August.). On the other hand, SSL is an encryption technology in the session layer of the fifth layer, and encrypts data such as WWW (World Wide Web) or FTP (File Transfer Protocol) widely used on the Internet, and is related to privacy. The purpose is to securely send and receive information and corporate secret information.</p>
      <p num="39">Table 1 shown in FIG. 7 compares and describes the function of IPsec and SSL. As far as this table shows, IPsec and SSL have opposite advantages and disadvantages.</p>
      <p num="40">For example, in the communication between the client and the client, in the case of SSL, since the command system and the communication contents are mainly related to each other, that is, the client / server, the communication between the client and the client cannot be performed without going through the server. That is, in the case where the terminal A encrypts and transmits the secret data to the terminal B by SSL, it is necessary to intervene the server in between. On the other hand, since IPsec does not have such a restriction, direct communication is possible.</p>
      <p num="41">In addition, in a Point to Point Protocol (PPP) mobile environment or an Asymmetric Division Subscriber Line (ADSL) environment, IPsec is used to determine encryption method, exchange keys, and mutual authentication before initiating encrypted communication of data. In a communication using the IKE (Internet Key Exchange) protocol, which is a protocol, a connection destination is authenticated.</p>
      <p num="42">Therefore, in the case of PPP mobile environment (remote client) or ADSL environment, the IP address cannot be fixed. Therefore, the IP address of the communication partner at the time of authentication, that is, the main mode of IKE, which is used most frequently, between IPsec gateways. The mode of using information is not available.</p>
      <p num="43">Also, the solution is to use the Aggressive mode to avoid using an IP address for ID information, and to use a user&#39;s password for ID information, for example, to use a user&#39;s password for an existing shared key. Can be. However, in the Aggressive mode, since the ID of the connection destination is transmitted in a message such as key exchange information, the ID is transmitted as plain text without being encrypted.</p>
      <p num="44">In addition, the problem of authentication can be solved by using XAUTH (Extended Authentication within IKE). However, since the IP address is unknown in the firewall setting, access from the remote client requires both IKE and IPsec to be allowed. There is a security problem. SSL can communicate even under this environment.</p>
      <p num="45">In addition, IPsec cannot cope with NAT (Network Address Translation) or IP masquerade. In order to cope with these, for example, it must be used in combination with other functions that are put in the payload of UDP.</p>
      <p num="46">NAT is a technology in which a company connected to the Internet shares one global IP address with a plurality of computers, and a technology for translating IP addresses (local addresses) and addresses on the Internet (global addresses) commonly used only within an organization. to be. The NAT cannot support NAT because the IP header is in the authentication range of AH (Authentication Header), so that the global address cannot be converted from this local address, and the subnet can communicate with other local addresses. Because there is no.</p>
      <p num="47">In addition, IP masquerade is a structure that enables access to the Internet from a plurality of clients having a private address in a LAN, and when this is used, only the terminal on which IP masquerade is operating from the outside (Internet) can be seen. Therefore, it can be said that it is desirable in security. The reason why IPsec cannot cope with IP masquerade is that IPsec&#39;s Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) header is directly behind the IP header.</p>
      <p num="48">A normal router implementing IP masquerade determines that there is a port number for TCP / UDP immediately after the IP header. Therefore, since the port number is changed through the router implementing IP masquerade, IPsec determines that it is a forgery and causes a problem that the host cannot be authenticated. This problem can be avoided by using a product that supports NAT-T for loading in the UDP payload.</p>
      <p num="49">However, if the draft version of NAT-T is different, even NAT-T compatible products cannot connect. SSL can communicate even under this environment.</p>
      <p num="50">On the other hand, SSL is ineffective against various attacks on TCP / IP by so-called hackers or crackers on the network, such as DoS attacks (Denial of Service). When a DoS attack on the TCP / IP protocol stack, for example, a TCP disconnection attack, is performed, the TCP session is disconnected and the SSL service is stopped.</p>
      <p num="51">Since IPsec is mounted on the third layer (IP layer), the IP layer has a security function, so that DoS attacks on TCP / IP (fourth and third layers) can be prevented. However, since SSL is an encryption protocol installed on the upper layer (the fifth layer) than the TCP / IP (the fourth layer and the third layer), the DoS attack on TCP / IP cannot be prevented.</p>
      <p num="52">In addition, SSL is more effective than IPsec for communication in poor communication environments in which communication errors with many physical noises occur frequently. In other words, when an error is detected, IPsec leaves the resend operation to the upper TCP. TCP sends resend data to IPsec, but IPsec does not recognize that the data is resent and re-encrypts it. Since SSL performs error recovery over TCP, there is no need to re-encrypt the same data.</p>
      <p num="53">In addition, IPsec cannot communicate with other LANs. That is, since distribution management of subnet addresses in a LAN is managed by a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server in the LAN, the same subnet address is not assigned in the LAN, but in case of communication between different LANs. Since the DHCP servers in the LANs of each other individually assign subnet addresses, the same addresses may be assigned.</p>
      <p num="54">When the same address is assigned in this way, communication cannot be performed in IPsec. However, if an IPsec-DHCP server is separately set up and managed not to become the same address, communication can be performed. Since the SLL is located on the fifth layer (session layer) of the OSI reference model as described above, the error recovery process can be performed by the TCP of the lower layer, and communication can be performed even in the above poor environment.</p>
      <p num="55">In addition, for communication in another network environment, IPsec manages all the nodes passing through and changes the settings so that IPsec can pass, but management is difficult. However, SSL is also used in this environment. It is possible to communicate without being aware of the environment of the passing nodes.</p>
      <p num="56">In addition, since SSL does not support UDP communication, UDP cannot be encrypted. Since TCP also supports only certain ports, it is not possible to encrypt all TCP ports. On the other hand, IPsec can perform encrypted communication in both UDP and TCP.</p>
      <p num="57">SSL is also problematic in that it is not compatible with the application. The application uses the socket (the fifth layer) as a program interface when performing internet communication. For this reason, if your application uses SSL (the fifth layer), you must change this socket interface to an SSL interface. Therefore, there is no application compatibility with SSL.</p>
      <p num="58">On the other hand, since IPsec is located under the socket (5th layer), an application can use the socket (5th layer) as it is as a program interface, and it is compatible with an application. In addition, while IPsec can be controlled by IP address unit, SSL is controlled by source unit (URL unit, folder unit).</p>
      <p num="59">In addition, IPsec has a problem that the maximum segment size becomes small. That is, in IPsec, in order to use an ESP header and an ESP trailer, since a payload becomes small, fragments (packet division) generate | occur | produce and a throughput falls. In addition, since fragments are prohibited in TCP packets, it is necessary to determine the environment where IPsec passes through and set a maximum segment size at which fragments do not occur at the end end. On the other hand, since SSL does not need to keep track of which environment to pass through, it is not necessary to set the maximum segment size.</p>
      <p num="60">As mentioned above, although the function comparison of IPsec and SSL was demonstrated based on Table 1 (FIG. 7,), as mentioned above, IPsec and SSL have mutually opposing advantages and disadvantages. On the other hand, the present inventor first proposed TCP2, which is an innovative cryptographic communication protocol that includes all the advantages of these IPsec and SSL, and also has many other advantages (see Patent Document 1).</p>
      <p num="61">In other words, in the invention described in Patent Document 1, it is not necessary to implement &#34;encryption function&#34; in each application program to prevent intrusion into a computer terminal, and therefore, there is no need to rewrite the application program itself. In addition, it is possible to communicate with a communication partner who does not support the encryption function by conventional plain text, and can also benefit from encryption or authentication even in an environment where IPsec cannot be used (or a situation where it is not desired to use). .</p>
      <p num="62">FIG. 8 shows a protocol stack used in the embodiment of the encrypted communication system first proposed by the inventor of the present invention in Patent Document 1. As shown in FIG.</p>
      <p num="63">As shown in FIG. 8, the protocol stack used for the invention described in this patent document 1 is a NIC (Network Interface) in the layer corresponded to the physical layer (1st layer) and data link layer (2nd layer) of OS17 layer. Card) The driver 11 is arranged. As mentioned above, this driver is a driver of an interface card for connecting hardware such as a computer to the network, and the contents thereof are data transmission and reception control software. For example, a LAN board or LAN card for connecting to Ethernet corresponds to this.</p>
      <p num="64">In the network layer of the third layer, there is an IP emulator 13, part of which extends to the transport layer (fourth layer). The function as a transport is not implemented in the said extended part. It merely provides the network layer&#39;s functionality to the session layer. The IP emulator 13 switches between [IPsec on CP] 13b and [IP on CP] 13a, which are protocols for performing encrypted communication, according to the purpose. Here, &#34;on CP&#34; means that the cracking protector (CP) is subject to monitoring, destroying, cutting or passing restriction of &#34;entrance&#34; and &#34;attack&#34;, or that can be set. I&#39;m showing up.</p>
      <p num="65">Further, [ARP on CP (Address Resolution Protocol on Cracking Protector)] is arranged at the network layer. [ARP on CP] is a protocol used to obtain a MAC (Media Access Control) address, which is an Ethernet physical address, from an IP address provided with a protection against a cracker. MAC is a transmission control technique used in a LAN or the like called media access control, and is used as a technique for specifying a method of transmitting / receiving a frame as a data transmission / reception unit, a format of a frame, error correction, and the like.</p>
      <p num="66">Here, the IP emulator 13 is software or firmware for matching various security functions according to the present invention to a stack around a conventional IP. That is, to control a group of hosts configured to efficiently deliver or receive the same data to a plurality of hosts, or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) 14a, which is a protocol for transmitting an IP error message or a control message. Software, or firmware, or hardware (electronic circuits, electronic components) for matching to Internet Protocol (IPP) 14b, TCP 15, UDP 16, or Socket interface 17, which is a protocol for to be. By this IP emulator 13, suitable processing can be performed before and after IPsec encryption and decryption, and necessary authentication information addition and authentication.</p>
      <p num="67">In the transport layer (fourth layer) above the IP emulator 13, a TCP emulator 15 and a UDP emulator 16 are arranged. The TCP emulator 15 functions to switch between [TCPsec on CP] 15b, which is a protocol for performing encrypted communication, and [TCP on CP] 15a, which is a normal communication protocol, according to a purpose. Similarly, the UDP emulator 16 functions to switch between [UDPsec on CP] 16b, which is a protocol for performing encrypted communication, and [UDP on CP] 16a, which is a normal communication protocol, according to a use.</p>
      <p num="68">The most important feature of this Patent Document 1 is that the transport layer (fourth layer) is equipped with TCPsec 15b and UDPsec 16b encrypted communication protocol. TCPsec 15b and UDPsec 16b will be described later.</p>
      <p num="69">The session layer (fifth layer) above the transport layer (fourth layer) is provided with a socket interface 17 for exchanging data with protocols such as TCP and UDP. As described above, the socket means a network address that is a combination of an IP address corresponding to an address in a network owned by a computer and a port number that is a subaddress of the IP address. Alternatively, the deletion may be arranged in a row, and may be composed of a single software program module (execution program or the like) or a single hardware module (electronic circuit, electronic component or the like).</p>
      <p num="70">This socket interface 17 also provides a unified access method from higher-level applications, and maintains a conventional interface such as the types and types of arguments.</p>
      <p num="71">In the transport layer, the TCP emulator 15 includes a TCPsec 15b having a function of preventing data leakage and forgery, that is, encryption, integrity, and relative authentication, and such encryption, integrity, and relative authentication. It has a function of distributing packets to either of the ordinary protocol TCP 15a which does not have the function of. In addition, since both of TCPsec 15b and TCP 15a have a cracking protector (CP), even if either of them is selected, a function to defend against &#34;entrance&#34; and &#34;attack&#34; by the cracker is provided. It can be realized. The TCP emulator 15 also plays a role of an interface with the upper layer socket.</p>
      <p num="72">As described above, while TCP has an error compensating function, UDP does not have an error compensating function, but it is characterized by a high transmission speed and a broadcasting function. The UDP emulator 16, like the TCP emulator 15, has a UDPsec 16b having a function of preventing data leakage and forgery, that is, encryption, integrity authentication, and relative authentication, and such encryption, integrity authentication, and counterpart. It has a function of distributing packets to any one of the ordinary protocol UDP 16a which does not have a function such as authentication.</p>
      <p num="73">As shown in Fig. 8, the socket 17, the TCP emulator 15, the UDP emulator 16, the [TCPsec on CP] 15b, the [UDPsec on CP] 16b, and the [TCP on CP] 15a. , [UDP on CP] 16a, [ICMP on CP] 14a, [IGMP on CP] 14b, IP emulator 13, [IP on CP] 13a and [ARP on CP] 12 Is a protocol stack for performing the encryption process of the present invention. Hereinafter, the protocol stack will be collectively referred to as TCP2.</p>
      <p num="74">In addition, although [IPsec on CP] 13b is not included as essential in TCP2, it can also be set as TCP2 including [IP sec on CP] 13b.</p>
      <p num="75">TCP2 disclosed in Patent Document 1 includes standard protocol stacks of TCP, UDP, IP, IPsec, ICMP, IGMP, and ARP in addition to the protocol stack for performing the above-described encryption processing. In addition, CP (cracking protector) is implemented in these standard protocols to protect against attacks from communication and application programs (for Trojan horses, program forgery, illegal use of regular users, etc.) on each protocol stack. I can do it.</p>
      <p num="76">In addition, in TCP2, the TCP emulator 15 is mounted, and the TCP emulator 15 is viewed from the socket 17 at the session layer and the IP emulator 13 at the network layer to maintain compatibility. Thus, in the outward direction, it can look like standard TCP. In practice, as a function of TCP2, TCP and TCPsec are switched. TCPsec is an encryption and authentication function in the transport layer of the present invention.</p>
      <p num="77">Similarly, in TCP2, the UDP emulator 16 is implemented, and the UDP emulator 16 is viewed from the socket 17 as the session layer and the IP emulator 13 as the network layer to maintain compatibility. Therefore, it can be seen as a standard UDP from the outside. In practice, as a function of TCP2, UDP and UDPsec are switched. UDPsec is an encryption and authentication function in the transport layer of the invention described in Patent Document 1.</p>
      <p num="78">Next, TCPsec 15b and UDPsec 16b, which are functions to prevent &#34;data leakage&#34;, which are particularly important functions in TCP2, will be described.</p>
      <p num="79">As a method of encryption / decryption (algorithm, logic (logic)) for TCPsec 15b and UDPsec 16b, a well-known secret key (common key) encryption algorithm is used. For example, DES (Data Encryption Standard), a secret key cryptographic algorithm developed by IBM in the 1960s, or 3DES as an improved version thereof is used.</p>
      <p num="80">As another encryption algorithm, IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm), which was published in 1992 by James L. Massey and Xuejia Lai of the Swiss Institute of Technology, is also used. This encryption algorithm encrypts data by dividing it into 64-bit blocks. The encryption key is 128 bits long. It is also designed to have sufficient strength for linear decryption and differential cracking, which efficiently decrypts secret key ciphers.</p>
      <p num="81">As the encryption method of TCPsec 15b and UDPsec 16b used in the invention described in Patent Document 1, an encryption method such as Fast Data Encipherment Algorithm (FEAL), MISTY, and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is also used. In addition, a secret encryption / decryption algorithm created independently can be used. Here, FEAL is an encryption method developed by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co., Ltd. (at the time), and is a secret key type encryption method using the same key for encryption and decryption. This FEAL has an advantage that encryption and decryption can be performed at a higher speed than DES.</p>
      <p num="82">Next, MISTY, which is an encryption method used in the invention described in Patent Document 1, is a secret key type encryption method developed by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, and encrypts data in 64 bit blocks as in IDEA. The key is 128 bits long. The same program is used for encryption and decryption, just like DES. This scheme is also designed to have sufficient strength for linear decryption or differential cracking, which efficiently decrypts secret key cryptography.</p>
      <p num="83">In addition, AES is the next-generation standard encryption method of the US government, which is being selected by the US Bureau of Standards and Technology, and developed as a next-generation encryption standard instead of DES, which is the current standard encryption method. Of the several cryptosystems collected in the world, in October 2000, a scheme called Rijndael, developed by Belgian crypto developers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, was adopted.</p>
      <p num="84">As described above, as the encryption method of TCPsec 15b and UDPsec 16b to be applied to the invention described in Patent Document 1, various known encryption algorithms of secret keys can be adopted, and the user independently developed them. Secret key (common key) cryptography is also available.</p>
      <p num="85">In addition, as a &#34;relative authentication&#34; and a &#34;completeness authentication&#34; method for preventing so-called &#34;falsification&#34; and &#34;falsification of data&#34;, an algorithm using a public key or pre-shared, for example, MD5 (Message) Authentication algorithms such as Digest 5) and Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1) are used. Instead of such a known authentication algorithm, an algorithm using a unique one-way function may be employed.</p>
      <p num="86">This MD5 is one of the hash functions (one-way summarization function) used for authentication and digital signature. It generates a fixed-length hash value based on the original text, and compares it to both ends of the communication path, thereby forging the original text during communication. It can detect whether it is not done. This hash value takes the same value as a pseudo random number, and based on this, the original text cannot be reproduced. It is also difficult to create another message that produces the same hash value.</p>
      <p num="87">SHA1 is also one of the hash functions used for authentication and digital signature, and forgery of original text on communication diagram is detected by generating 160-bit hash value from original text of 2 or less 64 power bits and comparing it at both ends of communication path. It is. This authentication algorithm is also employed in IPsec, which is typical of conventional encrypted communication on the Internet.</p>
      <p num="88">In addition, such an authentication algorithm is designed to allow secure key exchange using Diffie-Hellman (DH) public key delivery method, IKE (Internet Key Exchange) protocol (500 of UDP), and the like. It is regularly scheduled by the protocol driver program (TCPsec 15b, UDPsec 16b, etc.) so that the encryption / integrity authentication algorithm (logic) itself and the set / domain of keys for it are changed.</p>
      <p num="89">As described above, in the invention described in Patent Document 1, by using the TCP2 proposed by the inventor of the present application, the function of preventing data leakage, forgery, spoofing, entry, and attack can be enhanced without changing the program of the higher-level application. For this purpose, a new encryption system can be realized by mutually determining the encryption / decryption logic between the transmitting side and the receiving side, and applying this to the payload of a protocol corresponding to TCP or UDP present in the transport layer.</p>
      <p num="90">By the way, in the invention described in Patent Document 1, TCP2 proposed by the inventor of the present application is mounted on a personal computer in the form of software or hardware. However, in order to mount such software or hardware on a personal computer, the work for the implementation is required, and the burden on the personal computer itself also increases by the implementation of such software or hardware.</p>
      <p num="91">That is, in order to mount software or hardware on a personal computer, as mentioned above, the work for the mounting is required, and the burden on the personal computer itself also increases. In addition, the encryption system using TCP2 described above is for preventing &#34;leakage&#34; and &#34;forgery&#34;, &#34;fake&#34;, &#34;entrance&#34; or &#34;attack&#34; of data on the Internet, and is used only for communication between the personal computer and the outside. It is used.</p>
      <p num="92">The present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a simple means for communication between a personal computer and the outside without burdening a software or hardware for a personal computer. Is to make the TCP2 function proposed earlier.</p>

      <p num="114">EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION Hereinafter, although this invention is demonstrated with reference to drawings, FIG. 1 is a block diagram which shows the structure of embodiment of the relay apparatus which applied this invention.</p>
      <p num="115">In FIG. 1, the relay device 100 itself has a function equivalent to that of a personal computer. Thus, the relay device 100 is provided with NIC (Network Interface Card) drivers 1a and 1b respectively connected to the networks 200 and 300. In addition, a communication method for communicating while routing between a physical layer including the NIC drivers 1a and 1b and a data link layer between any two nodes existing on the networks 200 and 300 is performed. The network layer and transport layer including the [TCP / IP] 2 specified are installed.</p>
      <p num="116">And between the data link layer and the network layer, it is possible to install the function of [TCP2] 3 proposed by the present inventor first. In other words, the function of [TCP2] 3 can be installed as software or hardware, and the plaintext can be controlled without changing the encryption and decryption logic at regular intervals or performing encryption as necessary. Means for deciding to deal with the problem can be provided as an external function (EXP.) 4.</p>
      <p num="117">Therefore, in this embodiment, the relay device is equipped with the TCP2 function proposed by the inventor of the present invention so that the personal computer is not burdened with software or hardware to be mounted. In communication, it is possible to prevent &#34;leakage&#34; and &#34;falsifying&#34; or &#34;fake&#34;, &#34;entrance&#34; or &#34;attack&#34; of data on the Internet.</p>
      <p num="118">That is, the relay device 100 of the present invention is realized as a security gateway that connects TCP2 on a communication line that performs encryption communication and authentication, for example, as shown in FIG.</p>
      <p num="119">In FIG. 2, since the relay devices 101 and 102 including TCP2 do not depend on the physical interface of communication, they can be connected to various interfaces. Here, various communication interfaces including Ethernet, FDDI, PPP, wireless LAN, and IEEE1394 are referred to as interface A (network 300) and interface B (networks 201 and 202).</p>
      <p num="120">The relay device 101 inputs the existing communication data from the interface A, encrypts it with TCP2, and outputs the encrypted data to the interface B. In addition, the relay device 102 inputs encrypted communication data from the interface B, decrypts it with TCP2, and outputs the existing communication data to the interface A. In addition, the relay apparatuses 101 and 102 have a function of authenticating each other&#39;s TCP2 at the start of communication, and if the authentication is not possible, the communication is forcibly terminated.</p>
      <p num="121">Thus, in such a communication system, existing communication data is exchanged between the existing communication device 401 and the relay device 101, and the existing communication device 402 and the relay device 102, respectively. Encrypted communication data is exchanged between the 101 and the relay device 102, and it is possible to prevent &#34;leakage&#34; and &#34;forgery&#34;, or &#34;disguise&#34;, &#34;entrance&#34; or &#34;attack&#34; of the data in this portion. .</p>
      <p num="122">3 shows an embodiment of a more specific communication network. In Fig. 3, on the host computer A side, a plurality of personal computers 411, 412, 413 are connected by a network 201 such as Ethernet, so-called LAN (Local Area Network) environment is formed. Therefore, in this case, the relay device 101 for connecting with the external network 300 is a router.</p>
      <p num="123">In addition, an independent personal computer 420 is provided on the host computer B side. Therefore, in this case, the relay device 102 for connecting to the external network 300 is a gateway, and the personal computer 420 is connected to, for example, the network 202 by Ethernet. . In this case, the external network 300 is also connected by, for example, Ethernet.</p>
      <p num="124">In such a communication network, the ranges of the networks 201 and 202 are exchanged by the existing communication data, and in the part of the external network 300, the exchange is performed by the encrypted communication data. And it is possible to prevent &#34;leakage&#34; and &#34;false&#34; or &#34;fake&#34;, &#34;entrance&#34; or &#34;attack&#34; of data in the part of the external network 300.</p>
      <p num="125">In this way, according to the relay device of the present invention, it is used for communication of digitalization information by encrypting a protocol located in a transport layer, and determining means for determining encryption and decryption logic corresponding to the counterpart device facing each other. Protocol encryption means for encrypting and transmitting at least the payload of the protocol according to the encryption logic determined by the determining means among the packets as information units to be transmitted and received, and the decryption logic determined by the determining means for the payload of the received encrypted protocol. Therefore, by providing a protocol decryption means for decryption and performing communication based on encryption and decryption logic using a protocol of the transport layer, the personal computer is not burdened with software or hardware, and the like. In communication with the outside, It is possible to prevent &#34;leakage&#34; and &#34;forgery&#34; or &#34;fake&#34;, &#34;entrance&#34; or &#34;attack&#34; of data on the Internet.</p>
      <p num="126">Finally, how TCP2 of the present invention is superior to conventional IPsec or SSL will be described based on Tables 2 and 5 shown in FIG. 4. Table 2 of FIG. 4 shows the function of TCP2 added to the function comparison table of IPsec and SSL of Table 1 of FIG. 7 described above.</p>
      <p num="127">As is apparent from Table 2, it can be seen that various problems (such as those described in the background art) of IPsec and SSL are all solved by adopting TCP2. For example, client-client communication, DoS attack to the TCP / IP protocol, secure communication of all UDP or TCP ports, restrictions on applications that had to change socket programs, etc. Completely corresponds.</p>
      <p num="128">In addition, TCP2 fully supports communication in a poor environment where errors are frequently encountered in IPsec, communication between different LANs, connection via multiple careers, communication in a PPP mobile environment, and an ADSL environment. . In addition, in the mobile environment and the ADSL environment, IPsec and SSL also have problems as shown in Table 1 and Table 2 for the Internet using VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol). According to TCP2 of the present invention, either environment It can be handled under</p>
      <p num="129">In addition, IPsec and SSL are not compatible with Internet telephones using VoIP between different LANs, but TCP2 of the present invention can cope completely.</p>
      <p num="130">FIG. 5 is a diagram for explaining the superiority of TCP2, but the case (b) to which the conventional SSL is applied to the protocol stack (a) without security, the case (c) to which IPsec is applied, and the TCP2 (TCPsec) of the present invention. The case d to which / UDsec is applied is compared and shown.</p>
      <p num="131">As described above, the SSL of FIG. 5 (b) is installed in the socket of the session layer (the fifth layer), and thus is incompatible with higher-level applications. For this reason, SSL itself takes on the problem mentioned above. In addition, since IPsec of FIG. 5C is located in the network layer (third layer) and is incompatible with the IP layer, various restrictions as described above are subject to the network configuration.</p>
      <p num="132">On the other hand, TCP2 (TCPsec / UDPsec) in Fig. 5 (d) is an encryption technique introduced in the transport layer (fourth layer). Therefore, the socket can be used as it is from an application and the IP can be viewed from the network. Since it can be used as it is, there is no restriction in constructing a network.</p>
      <p num="133">As described above, the relay device of the present invention has an extremely high security function against data leakage, forgery, forgery, entry, and attack, in particular, compared to the existing encryption processing system by using the TCP2 proposed by the inventor of the present invention. .</p>
      <p num="134">In addition, this invention is not limited to embodiment described above, Needless to say that it includes more embodiment in the range which does not deviate from the summary of this invention described in the claim.</p>
