so
good afternoon everyone
the ohio mass today was sent to me by
cynthia
symphony cynthia matthias and
we appreciate that very much and people
are just coming up with all kinds of
designs i think this she said this is a
joanne fabrics design the time we're in
today is
is ohio university's heritage college of
osteopathic medicine
so we we thank all the folks who are
there
and all the graduates and professors
who help our health care system in the
state of ohio
let me start by thanking senate
president abhof speaker cup
members of the general assembly for
their leadership and assistance
in the controlling board's recent
approval of 419
000 419 million dollars
in cares act funding to help our fellow
ohioans
this money will be used for small
business grants 160 125 million
rent and utility assistance that's 50
million grants to bars in
restaurants 37.5 million
help for our hospitals 62 million
in our colleges and universities that's
100 million and support for ohio's
world-class art organizations as well as
non-profits
and that's a total of 25 million again i
thank them
all the members the controlling board
for getting this approved
it will do a lot of good one week from
today is
election day and so we have the
secretary of state
ready to talk to us and give us kind of
a report
frank larose mr secretary i can see it
looks like you're in your office with a
view of the
state house there that's a pretty nice
view tell us where we are a week out
well thank you so much governor you're
right it is a week before
election day but of course we're three
weeks into election month in ohio
and we've already seen record-breaking
numbers of ohioans taking advantage of
early
and absentee voting you can see the
countdown clock behind me six days
17 hours 29 minutes and 40 seconds until
the polls open
on the morning of tuesday november 3rd
and there are a couple things i just
wanted to talk about today governor i
really appreciate you giving me the
opportunity
uh to to discuss a few of these things
of course way back in the spring
we faced an unprecedented challenge and
ohio's elections officials
rolled up their sleeves to make sure
that we were ready we launched what we
called the
ready for november task force where we
had a weekly meeting that was shared
here on the ohio channel we set a few
key objectives
of course one thing that we wanted to do
is make sure that we got plenty of
people registered to vote because it's
hard to get
voter registration done in the
traditional ways and i'm happy to report
that we surpassed
eight million registered voters in the
state of ohio that's something that
we're really proud of
we also knew that we needed to launch an
unprecedented effort to recruit plenty
of poll workers
i'm happy to say that over 140 000
ohioans came to our website and signed
up to be poll workers and as we stand
today
well over 50 000 of them have been
trained and are ready to go to open our
polling locations in a safe and
accessible way
on tuesday morning november 3rd one of
the other things that we really focused
on was trying to maximize early and
absentee voting and i'll tell you that
has been a humongous success
we have seen a doubling in the number of
absentee ballots that we've seen in past
years and we've seen it triple as far as
early voting goes
and so by all accounts this has been a
very successful effort and of course
we had to make sure that right health
and safety protocols were put in place
so we worked with the ohio department of
health
and the united states centers for
disease control to put in place a
61-point checklist
so that every voter and every poll
worker can feel safe and comfortable
coming to participate in early in-person
voting as well as an election day voting
now
the bottom line is this there have been
some some folks wondering
uh will election day happen as scheduled
it of course will
election day is unchangeable the first
tuesday after the first monday in
november is set
in both state and federal law it has
been unchanged
since 1843. you can contrast that with
primary elections which routinely do
move over the years and we know
that as a result of the pandemic some
adjustments had to be made to the way
that ohio
conducted the primary back in march and
of course concluding at the end of april
but the general election day is set and
it will not change the polls will open
at 6 30 a.m
on november 3rd and that's important for
people to know they'll be open until 7
30 that night
now just like i said we're all excited
about election day but you don't have to
wait for election day because
in ohio we have election month in fact
voting continues today
voting continues tomorrow voting will be
happening on thursday
friday and as well as saturday and
sunday we're one of very few states in
the nation that offers weekend
early voting ohio has that we have
saturday early voting we've got sunday
early voting we've got convenient
evening hours
this week in fact on monday the day
before the election early voting
continues until two that day and it's
something that ohioans
are taking advantage of in really
massive numbers now i talked about that
health and safety plan that we put
together
we launched this two months ago a
61-point checklist
every board of elections is required to
follow that checklist what that'll make
sure of
is that again if you feel comfortable
going to the grocery store you should
feel comfortable coming to your polling
location
a lot of the same precautions are in
place you're going to see six feet of
social distancing
you're going to see personal protective
equipment being warned by both voters
and of course our poll workers any
elections observers that may be there
as well you're going to see common sense
things like having a door in
separate from a door out where that's
possible you're going to see something
as simple as a door stop
so that people aren't touching the door
handle all day long of course wiping
down of surfaces
we've been able to field massive
quantities of personal protective
equipment because of patriotic ohio
companies
that have stepped up and answered the
call and donated tpe
but we also took uh the vast majority of
our federal dollars and pushed them out
to this to the counties
so that they could spend those dollars
to procure the necessary ppe to make
sure that it's safe
i talked about us wanting to maximize
early and absentee voting that's been a
humongous success governor and i
actually have new numbers to report as
of today
3.2 million voters have already
requested an emsty bound
3.2 million ohioans have already
requested empty ballot now contrast that
to four years ago
the number was 1.6 million so we've
clearly seen a doubling
in absentee voting in ohio the bottom
line is this today
is effectively the last day the law says
you could wait until saturday but that's
a bad idea today is effectively the last
day
to request your absolute balance so if
you want to be one of those millions of
ohioans
who is voting from the safety and
comfort of home today is the day to do
so
you can do it easily by returning the
absolute ballot request form that we
sent to all
8 million ohio registered voters or if
you lost that or don't have it
you can go to voteohio.gov and on that
website you can print
the absentee ballot request form heck if
you don't have a printer you can even
make your own just using a plain
piece of notebook paper and we give you
all the instructions right there at
voteohio.gov
we've also seen 1.5 million ohioans who
have already returned their absentee
ballot but here's a reminder
if you requested an absolute ballot and
it's sitting there on your kitchen table
what are you waiting for go ahead and
fill it out do just like what lauren and
i did fill out your afsd
ballot put the appropriate postage in on
it and mail it in today and once you do
you can go to voteohio.gov and track
your ballot
to make sure that it's received by your
county board of elections now we've seen
over 750
000 ohioans that have taken advantage of
early voting that's
2.5 times the number that we saw in
2016. ohioans are clearly enthusiastic
now you may have seen some lines over
the weekend of course our
elections work to keep those socially
distanced so it may look like a longer
line than it actually is
but those lines move quickly and that's
a sign of enthusiasm
ohioans have 216 hours of early voting
and ohioans are taking advantage of that
enthusiastically and so if you like that
in-person voting experience don't wait
go to voteohio.gov to find
the hours and locations for early voting
in your county the location for early
voting in your county
and make sure to make your voice heard
we've also seen ohioans that have
cast their ballot in huge numbers 2.2
million as i already said
and we also know that 840 000 ballots
are still
out there so again if you're sitting on
that make sure to get it returned right
away
something else i want to address
governor there's been
no share no shortage of disinformation
and misinformation out there now ohioans
won't be fooled
ohioans know that the trustworthy source
for elections information
is your county board of elections
website for the ohio secretary of state
website voteohio.gov but there are folks
out there that want to spread false
information
if you believe that you're seeing false
information
intentional disinformation about
elections report it
we don't tolerate that in ohio we don't
tolerate voter intimidation
we don't tolerate disinformation the way
to report that is on
our email system it's report ohio
sos.gov that's monitored 24 hours a day
report ohio sos.gov and i've got a
success story
because of a thoughtful ohio that
reported to us
an incident of voter intimidation that
was targeted particularly at the
minority community a really
ugly and pernicious act of voter
disinformation
there's a cleveland grand jury today
that actually
just indicted two bad guys who are going
to face justice for it our office played
a role in helping to make sure that
these people face justice because they
were trying to confuse and intimidate
voters
we won't tolerate it anybody that thinks
that they're going to get away with that
kind of thing has another thing coming
we don't tolerate that in ohio ohioans
know it's easy to vote
it's easy to vote in the buckeye state
and now the bottom line is this
make your voice heard there's no excuse
for not voting you've got
a whole month of early voting a whole
month of absentee voting and you've got
in-person election day voting
and when this is all over governor
ohioans will know it was a fair and
honest contest now one last thing about
how we report
election night results we always report
an unofficial result on election night
now what does that mean
that means we report every early vote
every absentee vote
and every in-person election they vote
that's come in so far but it's never the
final story because ohio boards of
elections have
10 days to receive ballots as long as
they were cast
as long as they were mailed by monday
november 2nd
as long as it's a legal ballot it
deserves to be counted and so when we
have that unofficial result on election
night
it's going to be a snapshot in time the
official result a few weeks later
is the one that really counts but here's
something that we're doing that's
getting a lot of attention around the
nation
we're also on election night going to
report the number of outstanding
absolute ballots
that's a number that'll tell us how many
ballots are still out there in the
postal system that are waiting to come
back
and that'll give ohioans a good sense of
whether that's a conclusive result
they're seeing on election night or not
again the bottom line is this if you got
a ballot mail it in
if you want to vote absentee request
that absolute ballot today
whichever method you choose make sure
you vote ohio thanks so much governor
secretary thank you very much and thanks
to all the poll workers who are going to
be there
next tuesday and thanks to everybody at
the board of elections uh today that
are working hard to see that people can
vote today
thank you very much we appreciate it
well sadly the red tide of the virus
continues to spread throughout
ohio into every every corner of this
state there is no there's no escaping it
82 of our counties 82 of our counties
are now classified as high
incident spread counties only six
that are not every ohio needs to have an
understanding of exactly what is going
on
in their own community they need to
understand
what the data is what's happened in the
last two weeks with cases
hospitalizations etc
they need to understand the extent of
the spread in their community that's why
we continue to do these press
conferences that's why uh we post this
information
uh up online every day so with that in
mind let's
look at the numbers uh for today
as we look at these numbers i think
every ohioan needs to be alarmed by what
we are seeing
as you can see over 2500
new cases again
22 new deaths 198
new hospitalizations and 20
new icu admissions it was not that long
ago
it was not that long ago when this
number as you recall
uh three weeks ago three and a half
weeks ago
it was hovering around a thousand and we
thought it was going to drop
and stay below a thousand so this is
dramatically as you can see dramatically
gone up let's look at our 88 counties
now
88 counties in order all the way down
again this is the highest spread to the
lowest spread
and again this week we have colored in
blue all the counties that are high
incident counties
these are counties that have a high
incidence and
again you will see that just a handful
six counties at the bottom
do not have high incidence levels
again evidence that this is just
absolutely
everywhere high incidence
means the county has had more than a
hundred cases per hundred thousand
residents
over the last two weeks this number is
the distinction
that the cdc makes between a county with
a moderately high
level of spread and a high level of
spread
we know that a high level of cases in
the community just makes it
more dangerous um and increases the risk
of catching
this infection from someone else
let's go to the top uh 20 counties slide
again these are the the top 20 all areas
of the state
um continue to see this increase but
if you look at our top counties again
you'll see
that you know the first 10 counties are
you know some of the smaller counties of
of the state
you'll see some of the counties with you
know this is eight
over eight times the high incidence rate
this is you know five times four times
so you can just see that some of the
very very high incident counties are
just
literally literally off off the charts
and that is
certainly very concerning eric let's
look at the hospitalization
map as well and again this tracks the
entire period from back in april
uh to to the present and one of the
things that you will see
you'll see this color the light blue
is total hospitalization
people in the hospital icu with people
in icu
vent that's the yellow and that's people
who are on ventilators so you can see
how those numbers are moving
again this is a snapshot of how many
people are in the in the hospital
so what you're seeing of course is a
much steeper curve
than we saw than we saw in in june
certainly a steeper curve than we saw
before
we have seen peaks in the
hospitalization before once in the
spring
and again this summer the current
increase in utilization is noticeably
sharper steeper than the increase we saw
during the summer peak
based on the trajectory of other
early indicators we've likely not yet
reached the top we have no indication
that we've
plateaued out at all coveted positive
utilization has basically doubled
from i see excuse me positive icu
utilization has doubled
from the beginning of october and that
is very concerning as well again we're
not to the point where any of our
hospitals are overflowing
but the trend lines are not not good
as you can see this virus is spreading
and it is
everywhere in ohio
it is community spread that is driving
this
when you see numbers as high as we just
looked at that indicates
that virtually every county has except
six 82 counties
have this high high spread which means
it's out in the community
the community spread endangers our
schools
our nursing homes and our hospitals
take a look at the slide that we have
right here
is a cause and effect
community spread caused by these things
and other things
lead to problems in nursing homes our
schools
and in our hospitals it is cause and
effect as the virus spreads in the
community from gatherings where people
aren't wearing masks or
aren't social distancing it is directly
impacting our ability to keep our
schools open
directly impacting our ability to
protect
our elderly and those who are ill who
are in our nursing homes
and it directly impacts ultimately our
hospitals
and if it continues and we possibly can
see our hospitals overrun
things that we've seen on tv but have
not yet experienced in ohio
and something that we certainly do not
want to
experience again these are some of the
things that
are causing our community spread no mask
people not
keeping a distance game day watch
parties now
large wedding receptions crowded bars
house parties
extended family uh gathered gathering
gatherings with extended family
um these ultimately
if you worry about your your grandmother
in the nursing home
this community spread is how we can
control it keeping that down when it
goes up
the odds of it getting into a nursing
home goes up when it goes up and it's as
high levels as we're seeing in many
counties today
it threatens our k-12 schools when it
goes up
it threatens ultimately our hospitals
so what do we do about this
in the words of two great ohio state
coaches
um and let me quote from them
we do need to stick to our game plan
because we know it works
ohio when we stick together we always
win they said it very very well
this is a game that we must win and to
do that
we have to get back to basics we have to
get back
to the fundamentals wear a mask when
you're out in public
when you go to a store when you're with
friends
keep your distance wash your hands often
work on the ventilation so you're
bringing in more air from the outside in
your in your home
or in the public building that you're in
charge of
if you're one of the 82 counties you
live in one of the 82 counties
that is now a high incident county
let's be more specific
please reconsider reconsider hosting or
attending gatherings of any size
this includes with friends and extended
family people who don't live
in your in your household two
think about canceling events
certainly don't go to halloween parties
three were masked inside and outside
when you cannot
social distance above the nose over the
mouth
secure under the chin stay home if
you're not well
cooperate with your local public health
officials if you're diagnosed with coven
19
or exposed to somebody who has coven 19
work remotely from home if you can and
we need help from our businesses
uh allow employees to work from home
when possible
a lot of people did that if you can
still do that if that works
it's better two send your employees
communications urging them to take
personal precautions to
prevent the spread of covet 19 not just
during
their time at work but when they're home
when they're out
and about three
for retail establishments require
customers to wear masks
unless there is some specific exemption
our problem is community spread
because 82 of our counties are high
incidence counties
i am today asking leaders
in every single county
to redouble your efforts uh we've seen
a lot of great leadership come out of
mayors county commissioners
business community those in labor we've
seen
people uh in our lot of leadership
around the state
on this issue and so thank you very very
much
now though is the time to reevaluate in
each
single community every county exactly
what
you are doing and so i'm asking you to
pull together
that group of leaders in the community
drawn from all different all different
parts
of the community each community
really needs to reassess right now
what it is doing and what it can do in
the future
we are at a critical stage review
certainly should include county
commissioners mayors
health commissioners school and hospital
leaders college leaders
community other community leaders
including those from the faith-based
community
from business and from the non-profit
sector
one of the great things about our state
is the great communities
and how people pull together whether
it's a large
county or a small county that people
come together to solve
problems we are all in this together
what each person does or does not do
will determine how well we do over the
next few months
before the vaccine arrives
i'm going to start meetings today as
soon as this
press conference is over uh
and we're going to start first with the
three counties that are on
the watch list we'll do two of those
counties today one tomorrow
then i will move to the highest of the
high
incidence counties and again you know
we'll start with these counties
and start working our way down um and
again
we'll do a zoom call we'll bring people
together
and we'll just kind of talk and we'll
exchange ideas
um i'll be there my team will be there
to listen to your concerns listen to
where you need us to help you we'll tell
you where we can
help you but these kind of meetings i
think are
are very very important now it's going
to take me a while to
get down through the list uh but we're
going to do them as fast as we can but
obviously in the meantime we would ask
you to
pull together uh set up a meeting
yourselves
uh get on the phone get on zoom get on
whatever
however you can do it uh and pull people
together
in in the community because it's
communities working together
that's going to make the difference this
is how we're going to beat
this enemy we have a common enemy
we have a common enemy and that is this
virus and it's a virus
that will not the trend lines will not
change
unless we change them if we continue to
do the same things we've been doing
we're going to end up getting the same
results so although
many people are wearing masks many
people are being very very careful
we need just to get that our game up uh
and we need to get more and more people
who are doing that
and this ground game this grassroots
effort
uh i think is really uh the key to
getting
this done so i look forward uh
myself to being on these on these calls
i look forward to
talking with with each and every one of
you
uh but i would ask you again to get get
started on that
right away um
we have the ability working with local
leaders
to offer some state support and a lot of
this we've already
talked about and extended things such as
increased rapid and rapid testing
additional
personal protection equipment help with
contact tracing so people can quarantine
and stop the spread in its tracks
helping guidance with air ventilation
buildings and other things
look we are ohioans we always come
together
uh in a time of flood along the ohio
river or
one of our other uh rivers uh in the
state
uh where there's been bad fires uh
when there has been tornadoes we rally
together our communities just come
together
uh like that so we've got to do that
in regard to this virus we've got to
come together and
go after uh this invader because we
truly have in fact been
invaded
if you're a county eric let's look at
that slide again
if you're a county with a high incidence
if you're up here set a goal let's say
you're
let's say you're mercer at 478 or you're
at homes with 398.
you know set the goal to to knock it
down 100.
set a goal to knock it down 200.
whatever that goal
is work in that community to get
that done because when you take the
cases down
you're going to take the
hospitalizations down and you're going
to ultimately take the deaths down
it's really as simple as simple as that
our goal in the state should be to get
every county every county should have an
ultimate goal
of getting under 100. now that's the
high incidence
we certainly we certainly have the
ability to to do that
and let's each one of us uh recommit
uh let's look at our county and say
here's where we can block this virus
from spreading more
we can take this action we can do that
the ability to do that lies uniquely
with
you as the leaders in each one of our of
our counties
[Music]
let me now turn to the lieutenant
governor
john thank you governor yeah i just want
to reiterate
uh i think that these calls that we're
going to be doing are
are essential uh because we need
to have a local strategy a localized
strategy to get at this is we see the
virus spreading uh dramatically in every
county in the state
as you articulated well this is this
this virus is spreading at the community
level and the things that we do in our
own personal time
we need we need people basically to
take ownership of the prop of the
problem at the local level take action
on the solutions at the local level and
and it's going to take a community
effort to get that done and
i believe that it's going to happen i
believe as you said people are going to
rally to the cause they're going to set
a goal they're going to be determined
and we're going to begin to to move this
trend in the other direction
soon but it's it's not going to change
without that effort
uh i i would as i like to do i always
like to try to give
some component of our economic recovery
uh as we fight the virus and the
economic consequences of the virus i
want to
set a reminder for people look
i know that they're the technology and
the virus are changing the economy
quickly and people need to
to get retrained this is a perfect time
to do it
and through techcred we have the
opportunity for employers of this state
to upskill their employees
uh to upskill somebody perhaps that they
want to hire
into one of these new positions as
technology's changing the role of those
of those jobs we will pay up to 2 000
of a person's industry credentials some
of these industry credentials
credentials come with college credits
associated with them
uh this is a great opportunity for you
to to engage
so if you're an employer and you want to
upskill one of your employees
go to techcred.ohio.gov the deadline for
the latest round of applications is on
friday
we need to get this going we talk about
unemployment statistics at the macro
level
but we know that the impact the economic
and social impact is at the individual
level
about everybody uh being empowered to
better prepare for
their futures and to help your company
and to help themselves
in the economy and this is one way to do
it techcred.ohio.gov
enroll before friday 3 p.m deadline
thanks governor
we're ready for questions thanks
lieutenant governor governor your first
question today is from adrian robbins at
wcmh
in columbus hi governor thank you for
taking questions today
uh earlier today president trump tweeted
fake news media
is going full on covid coveted kobet we
are rounding the turn
now you've been in a pretty grim picture
today who should ohioans be listening
to when the president say we're rounding
a turn and you're asking people to
double down
well i can only speak what i see in ohio
and
what we see in ohio is um we're not
we're not headed the right direction
we're headed the wrong direction uh it
doesn't mean we can't turn
around look i i i give the president a
lot of credit
uh for putting the money in very very
early
uh to develop the vaccine we're going to
have a vaccine
and cavalry is coming to the rescue or
whatever your analogy you want you want
to have so there's hope out there
we're going to get through this uh we're
going to get those vaccines it's going
to take a while to get it all out and
get enough people
um vaccinated but you know
we can do that but we've got to get
through the next few months
and to get through the next few months
and keep businesses open
keep kids in school keep things going
we've got to do the things that i talked
about today
that's that's the we we know the recipe
as our two coaches said we know what
works we've got the game plan
let's just execute on it next question
is from christa frost at wbns in
columbus
yeah so at the beginning of the pandemic
many things were shut down so we could
flatten the curve and we're seeing a
spike
now obviously so what's the difference
from
then to right now should people expect
to see another shutdown
yeah uh here's the here's the difference
uh we already did that once
and we saved a lot of lives and ohio
high ones should be very proud of where
they are
or what they've done in the past twice
they have been able to knock this virus
down
but we know that a complete shutdown
will have other consequences that are
not good
and so you know we had kids who lost
march april lost a few months
they had remote but uh they were
certainly not in class
you know we we had businesses that were
shut down
uh we had other other bad things come
uh mental health problems etc
so we don't want to shut down again
we've done it once
um we just can't do it twice
or we certainly don't want to do it
twice we want to avoid doing it twice
and so the game plan i've outlined today
very short very simple very easy will
get us out of this
and we will not have to shut down but if
we don't do this and if we don't fight
this battle
county by county city by city village
by village if we do not fight in that
way
we will one way or the other be shut
down
and we will be shut down because the
spread will be so bad
so look we we have thanksgiving looming
we have christmas coming up uh it is
getting darker
uh in the sense that we're losing light
and um
you know look people are inside more
just because of the cold and because of
the
uh when it gets dark so people are
inside a lot more and we know it's it it
can be a very dangerous time for the
spread
uh of of this virus so we gotta
make a correction really quick um
that's what we got to do but we know how
to do it we've done it twice before
i'm asking ohioans to do it again
governor if i could if i could add to
that
answer the the place that the the
governor highlighted earlier today
the spread is not coming from businesses
it's coming from what people are doing
on their own personal time
and so a shutdown doesn't affect that
we're trying to target the solutions to
get people to own it
at the personal level because that's
where the solutions lie
is what we do on our own personal time
businesses have shown that they
they can create a safe environment and
and they're doing that across the state
and and we need to we need to focus the
solutions on where the problem is
some of my best friends in the
legislature talk about personal
responsibility i'm a big believer in
personal responsibility too i know they
are
this is about personal responsibility
and what each and every one of us can do
next question is from scott hallas at
the zenith daily gazette
hey scott hey governor how are you
i'm good uh just a question
we've got uh winter sports coming up in
ohio teams are starting to try out
they're picking their teams and i know
um there's limits you know as far as
there was limits for volleyball how many
people can be in a gym or whatever
has there been any thought given yet to
what's going to happen
in the winter when you have wrestling
basketball inside
swimming you know bowling all inside the
same places are there going to be
more stricter limits because of the
community spread because people are
inside more now
i had a superintendent today this
morning email me and say
recommend that we you know postpone
sports winter sports uh
into into january to see where we are i
don't know the answer to scott
but i know what i can tell
you and everyone else is despite we are
seeing this
what we're seeing threatens everything
that we want to do
we've got to get control over it
next question is from alex ebert at
bloomberg
for taking our questions governor billy
this spring dr amy acton
said that projections showed there would
be about 10 000 news cases per day
then later after um steps were taken
we saw that that projection decreased to
about 1 600 cases per day
we've now blown past that sort of
projection on a daily case basis
what are the current projections and
your health experts saying we could see
as far as a peak of new cases per day
goes in ohio
if things continue the way they're
headed thanks for your time yeah we
reviewed a
a a projection yesterday
um it didn't come from ohio uh so i'm
going back to our ohio
folks and take a look at it but it was
it was this projection was stunningly
high
uh it was so high that i said you know
we got to go look at
let's try our ohio folks see what they
say so i don't have an answer today
i'm going back to some of the folks that
do modeling
at our universities here in ohio and
kind of see what they look
what they come up with you know again i
think the caution always
on this is what assumptions are you
are you using you know what
and one of the one of the key
ingredients i will tell everybody as we
talk to modelers
is what percentage of people are wearing
masks
that's that's always one of the key
inputs
into that so we know from them and
and from what we've seen in ohio that
worry mask is fundamentally important
uh it is back and that is as i said at
the beginning back to basics
so there are things that we know will
will change the outcome
next question is from dan derose at wo
in cleveland
good afternoon governor how are you i'm
good thank you
so i know you're not a fan of the uh
phrase herd immunity you prefer
community immunities so my question is
sort of along that line
when you look at 202
when you look at 202 positive 202
000 positive cases in the state of ohio
that represents about
1.6 of the state that's actually tested
positive
granted we know that to be much higher
not everybody got tested early on
that had symptoms and probably had it so
experts are saying
maybe around five percent at least here
in cuyahoga county
are we seeing higher numbers now because
we did such a good job
early on uh and we did close down early
and we did wear masks in july is this
just
sort of the vaccine not going away
and we're not ever going to be able to
avoid
getting above one and a half percent or
five percent people getting infected
well clearly
the more people you have infected um
you know assuming that
this immunity lasts and we've seen some
cases where someone got it again
so i'm not i don't pretend to be the
medical expert
but obviously if you've had more people
get it then
if they do have immunity you would
assume there's fewer people who can get
it in the future
but you know that would be a horrible
horrible strategy
it would be a strategy that basically
said let's everybody get everybody
exposed
and there's no there's no reputable
scientist
that i'm aware in the world who thinks
we could reach
herd immunity in any close proximity of
time
i've heard numbers from 60 to 70 75
percent
you need to get the hurt immunity again
i'm not the scientist
but we're not even beginning down that
pathway
so you know
we are seeing the spread because it's
spreading
and because we're not doing the
interventions that we need
and we know the things today you know we
know a lot more than we knew in march
in february we know these masks are
phenomenally effective
not perfect but they're phenomenally
effective
so you know the idea that we get hurt
immunity community immunity whatever you
want to call it
it's just it's been a discredited theory
uh in regard to the coronavirus because
no one thinks we can get it in a
reasonable period of time
the other thing i would say is that by
saving lives early
um you know in in in
we not only are saving lives but if
someone
i mean i said early on at one of these
press conferences if you had a choice of
getting it in february or getting it in
in november you'd be better off getting
it in november we don't want anybody to
get it
but doctors are no more and they know
how to treat it more
still not curable still losing people
every single day but they certainly
they certainly know more so the idea
that we can herd immunity our way out of
this is is been discredited by everybody
the only way you get the hurt immunity
or community immunity is we're going to
get it is through
vaccine next question
and it will come next question is from
andy chow at ohio public radio and
television
andy hi governor um
back in may there were leaders
in the legislature that wanted you to
start addressing the pandemic county by
county
rather than a statewide perspective now
it sounds like the game plan is going to
more of a county by county level what's
the explanation
for the game plan there and then do you
also expect
possibly counties to be shutting down
businesses on a county level
well let me talk about that for a moment
you know we made the decision uh early
on
uh to treat the state as one unit
a part of that was legal uh we believe
that for example in regard to bars you
have to
treat it late you have to treat it
equally we know that
legally if there's any discrepancy
between one county another
you know the burden's upon you to show
why you're making a distinction but
but that had to do with shutdown um
what we're talking about now is really
taking community work up to a
higher level we've got
a lot of great mayors a lot of great
commissioners a lot of great
health commissioners a lot of great
leaders in the faith-based community who
are doing a bang-up job
all we're saying really today is let's
reconcentrate our efforts
because whatever your county was before
it's higher today
and for those counties in the spring
where it was clearly in the
in the urban areas
if you lived in a rural area you were
not having much impact
now no matter where you are you've got
to go deal with it so what we're simply
saying particularly to the smaller
counties
who had avoided this for a long time
we're simply saying hey
we gotta we need you we need you to come
in we need you to rally
um and and to do that but this is not
the state backing off nor is it nor is
it
am i saying i shirk any responsibility
i'm just i'm just saying we need more
players on the field
we need more troops on the ground uh we
got to all be in and for the counties
that
could get by in the spring and not be in
i understand that
they weren't seeing it today they're
seeing it today their nursing homes are
threatened
so their hospitals are threatened and
their schools are threatened
that's the difference next question is
from jeff
redick at wsyx in columbus
good afternoon governor the
big 10 continues to have its games
obviously
here in columbus local health experts
are worried about the house parties
the um the unofficial tailgating going
on in neighborhoods
they've asked the big ten to reconsider
having night games
or cable games because not everyone has
access they have to crowd together to be
able to watch the game
but they feel they're being ignored by
the big ten
would you reach out on their behalf have
you been approached about doing so
does this worry you
well to answer the second the one
question uh i not thought about that
as far as when the games were scheduled
or where the games were
what they were available on so we
certainly can take it take a look at
that
my concern about big ten football has
always been not what goes on the field
you know they're following very strict
protocols it doesn't mean you can't have
spread they certainly could
but i i do believe that the athletes who
are under that protocol
who have a great great great desire to
play uh
probably are certainly safe and maybe
safer than
it's just an average student um but what
i've always worried about and continue
to worry about i'm
just talking to amir ginther today and
talking to some other mayors
uh is simply what do people do
you know they're watching the game you
know uh and they got and they bring a
bunch of people together and that's why
you know
again this is what i said earlier on you
know
really reconsider those you know i know
it's more fun watching ohio state when
you got
you know a bunch of people and you're
drinking beer or you're eating something
and pizza or
drinking pop whatever but um
let's enjoy the season let's enjoy the
game but let's don't get
the virus because of it
next question is from danny eldridge at
hannah news service
hello governor um so uh i know when
people ask you about the president you
like to say you want to focus on ohio
well
the president came to circleville in
central ohio and you greeted him
at the airport you know tacitly
endorsing
this huge event that he was holding in
ohio during
you know a time that's really bad
what does that send how do you justify
that
i justify it this way i'm the governor
of the state of ohio the president of
the united states
comes here i want to greet him
it's important for the governor of ohio
to have a relationship
with the president of the united states
and i think that is that is important i
was not at the rally
look i've made it very very clear that
whether you're at a rally whether you're
a protest
whether you're at a football watching
party
gathering together without mask with
virus
that has spread as deeply as it has into
every
crevice in the state of ohio is a
mistake
and so you know i again would urge
people
wear masks whatever you whatever you're
doing and those
particularly if you're close to someone
else and you can't you can't do the
social distancing
so don't please understand exactly what
it was
it was the governor of ohio greeting the
president of the united states
and i've also endorsed him and i
continue to endorse him
next question is from laura bischoff at
the dayton daily news
hey laura hey governor um so 82 counties
are this high incidence of red or orange
none are at purple is your
administration not categorizing
counties as purple until after the
election
no no no no oh no this is all on data
or data people tell me what it is on on
wednesday
uh or usually it's late uh late
wednesday
uh sometimes early thursday uh they
confirm it again
right before the the press on the press
event at two o'clock on thursday and i
report whatever they tell me to report
no no this is on data basically on data
we've got three counties
that could go um purple
but remember under the criteria
they have to continue you know they
can't just still be
they've got to see the increase continue
to go for that last week
so they've got to do it two weeks in a
row they've got to have that growth that
significant growth for two straight
weeks
i mean we could have shown that's the
way we set it up it takes two weeks in a
row to do that
so this would be the second week for
those three counties and i don't know
whether they're going to hit that or not
they hit it we'll call it
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
afternoon governor i know you've said
that you would like to avoid
another economic shutdown like we had
earlier this year so with that being
said could we see
more along the lines of uh capacity
limits and things like that at bars
restaurants and stores maybe more so
than just the six
foot distancing that we have in place
now
yeah i'm really
i mean they've they've got to those
those outliers have got to
do what they should be doing and if they
don't there needs to be consequences and
there will be in fact be consequences
but answer your question i'm not i'm not
taking anything off the table please
don't misunderstand
you know as governor of the state i'm
going to do what i have to do
but i know as john houston said and he's
spot on
that where we're seeing the spread the
big spread at least
uh generally is in people's own personal
lives
that's why we ask business to jump in
and tell you talk to your employees
about being safe when they go home
um you know that's that's why uh we're
talking to any community leaders to talk
to people about that because
that is an area that you know we don't
have any any really control over what
people do in their own home
uh you know what they do in their in
their personal time
those things um that's where personal
responsibility has got to come in
and that's what will really make the
difference but no i'm not taking
anything off the table
we'll do what we have to do
next question is from amanda van allen
at wews
in cleveland hey governor
um i know you talked about this a little
bit a couple questions ago but i wanted
to clarify something
um i know that the counties usually
change over color
every thursday i mean you talked about
three counties potentially going purple
i'm most concerned about cuyahoga county
um over here in cleveland is that one of
the three counties
yeah i mean they're you know and this is
not a news today i mean this is
their three counties were on the watch
list last thursday
what that simply means is they hit the
criteria last thursday
but under our way we set this up months
ago
they've got to hit that twice in a row
and so we're going to see
you know thursday what they hit whether
or not they hit they become purple or
they don't become perfect
again i would just caution everyone you
know you got to look at two things look
at
look at how much spread you've had how
many new cases you've had in the last
two weeks
per hundred thousand that's very very
important the other thing is look at the
color
and when you get to purple what that's
indicating is you got potential problems
in your hospitals
that's why purple is so so important
next question is from jesse ballmer at
the cincinnati enquirer
jesse hello governor um
my question is about like the size of
events like the
rally in circle bill this weekend i
guess will you ask presidential
candidates to limit the size of their
events similar to the ask
that you're making to people attending
football parties this weekend
look we're asking people
consistently to wear a mask
you could have a football party if you
wore a mask
uh i mean you have to be careful you'd
have to you know you've got to make that
judgment call
but wearing the mask is what we're
asking people to do
you know i wouldn't suggest they do a
big party for a football game
uh if they can be outside and wearing
masks and watching a screen
that may make some sense i mean every
situation is
is different and so i did ask
last week in anticipation of the rally
in circleville everyone to to wear
a mask and i will
you know continue uh to to do that there
was an event
there was an event uh a an event
uh a trump event in youngstown i picked
up the phone
the morning it was going to occur and
called into the radio station
and talk talked on the dan river show
the reason i called in is i wanted to
say
please we're you know we're a mask if
you're going to this event
so i think you know i think i'm
consistent in that
next question is from josh roltenberg at
spectrum news
hi governor how are you josh you just
said about
20 minutes ago if we don't fight this
county by county village by village we
will one way or another be shut down
because spread will be so bad
so at what point will we be shut down is
it when
counties reach purple what what is that
exactly
josh i i've said this before and let me
let me kind of try to articulate it
maybe better
what will happen is what we're already
starting to see happen in
some communities where the schools have
to go remote
but they don't want to go remote or
where they planned on
coming out a remote and they stay remote
because
they're seeing spread we're seeing
schools that are have been
totally open five days a week that have
had to pull back for a couple weeks
why because they had an outbreak in
their school
you'll see it in in nursing homes
the spread in nursing homes comes from
people generally who are
going in out the door and most of those
people work there or they bring supplies
there
so when you've got broad spread in the
community you're going to see broad
spread in the in
eventually you're going to see spread in
the nursing home no matter how
how much they try same with hospitals i
mean you
will start to see things happen in
hospitals
where they'll say we're not going to do
uh elective surgeries or we're going to
pull back from this or pull back from
that
so look we're watching it we look at the
data every single day
but to this point we still have it
within our control
it's still within the control
we can have it within our control
and that is if the people of county
after county get mad
and say we're not going to put up with
this virus anymore we're going to go
beat it
that's what we need to have happen and
we've got to do it
and we can do it governor next question
is the last question for today and it
belongs to john london
at wlwt in cincinnati hey john
the governor you uh said a moment ago
the heaviest lift is with uh personal
lives and
that you're going to meet with the watch
list counties and start that right after
this briefing
hamilton county being one of course i'm
interested to know who you will meet
with and and what do you want
in place governor besides uh better
messaging
and encouraging mass square yeah i
i think that you know particularly with
smaller counties
i i think there needs to be an
acceptance that we got to go win
uh that this is a battle worth fighting
uh
and we need all the county commissioners
uh frankly
uh or or county executives uh in case of
cuyahoga county for example
summit county uh uh you know we need
all the all the opinion leaders um yeah
we need everybody in
in the game so i'm looking generally for
about 10 people on these calls
and and look it's going to be an
exchange i'm not going to sit there and
tell them what to do it's going to be an
exchange
we're going to make sure they understand
what resources we have that we can bring
in
i've always found talking with people
communication is good
we've had a lot of communication during
this but we're going to make this more
formal
and so we just we'll go go right down
down
down the line i mean i i talked to you
know mira cranley
twice a week at least and i talked to
mayors and commissioners
all over the state but we're going to do
this more formally and just
methodically do it
let me close by saying uh on this date
in 1858 our 26th president theodore
roosevelt was born
and let me say something that from his
1905
inaugural address which i think is
pertinent to what's going on today
and i quote from theodore roosevelt much
has been given us and much will
rightfully be expected from us we have
duties
to others and duties to ourselves
and we can shirk neither it's time for
us
to to go to battle and uh to go defeat
the virus
we'll see y'all in a couple days thank
you
[Music]
[Applause]
