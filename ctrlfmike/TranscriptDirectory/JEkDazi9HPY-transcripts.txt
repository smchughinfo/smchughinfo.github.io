cleveland in the 1950s
like a lot of cities had a numbers game
this is now what we think of as like the
ohio lottery
people playing numbers every day hoping
to
pick the right numbers and get a payout
but it was illegal
the lottery was illegal and so it was
really organized crime figures who were
running
daily policy or numbers games around the
city
local organized crime figures had very
elaborate networks of people who would
collect your numbers
every day and figure out who who won and
do payouts and of course take
a cut of the winning so all of that that
the policy game the numbers racket
is being run by organized crime figures
in cleveland throughout the 1950s
and the police had particular units that
were
trying particularly to catch the guys
running the numbers racket
[Music]
shondor burns had been running the
numbers game and then ended up in prison
for a couple years when he got back out
of prison
he wanted to start getting his cut of
the numbers game again
and he went to don king and the other
guys running the numbers game and
demanded his weekly payments
so don king started paying him but
eventually thought you know i'm sick of
kicking back to shondura burns i think
i'm going to run my own numbers game
and he he quit paying shondor burns not
long after that
in 1957 a bomb goes off on the front
porch of his house
and don king believes that this is
shondura burns sending him a message
carl de lau is a cleveland police
detective
he is charged with enforcing the vice
laws the anti-gambling laws
he is very familiar with shondura burns
and don king and the other
people in the cleveland underworld
ordinarily these kind of organized crime
figures aren't giving a lot of
information to the police
but don king explains what went on and
he said i think it was shondor burns
he's the one who set this bomb on my
house and he gives them a number of
names
including virgil ogletree virgil
ogletree was a boxer in cleveland
possibly connected to shondor burns and
don king says
you want to go find ogletree i think he
was involved in this and the police
develop information that ogletree may be
staying at doll remap's house
the police officers claimed that they
were informed
that there were some paraphernalia for
the numbers game
in the house and they were also informed
that a person wanted for
questioning in a bombing was in the
house
the remap was connected with a lot of
figures in the boxing world and some of
those figures were also connected to
organized crime they were sometimes used
as like the muscle for some of the
organized crime figures
in cleveland and she also owned a home
in shaker heights and she would rent out
some rooms in that house
and sometimes she'd be renting out rooms
to some of these boxers or maybe other
people involved in the numbers racket
the police arrive at doll remaps house
this is a couple days after the bombing
so it's not like an emergency or
something they don't think there
is a bomb in the house they knock on the
door it's early afternoon
and they want to come in and look for
ogletree
but dollerymap says no i don't want you
to come in do you have a warrant
they don't have a warrant so she does
what every defense lawyer today would
dream of which is
she actually calls her lawyers it's
remarkable she's a young
african-american woman in cleveland
owning her own home she has a daughter
she's running her boarding house
and she won't let the police in she's
demanding to see a warrant and they
don't have a warrant it's worth noting
that
it wasn't an emergency situation there
wasn't really any reason for carl de lau
not to go get a search warrant to enter
her house it's really just that
they didn't get search warrants very
often back then eventually later in the
afternoon the police break into the
house and she immediately demands to see
a warrant
so the police hold up a piece of paper
and say here's the warrant
she grabs the piece of paper out of
their hands and
according to the u.s supreme court
opinion she put
this piece of paper into her bosom and
very readily the police officer put his
hands into her bosom
and removed the paper later when we
finally get into court
the police have no warrant to show now
the evidence discloses
that no search warrant existed so
whatever that piece of paper was that
they were waving around
it was not a search warrant to search
her house they did arrest her
they claimed that she was resisting
arrest by trying to basically get the
copy of the warrant
which wasn't really a warrant and then
they searched the house they did not
find
virgil ogletree which is the person they
were there looking for
they did find a number of materials that
were like gambling
policy numbers materials and they also
found some materials that they thought
were obscene
so it starts out where she's charged
with both gambling and obscenity but she
goes to trial first on the gambling
charge and is acquitted by the jury so
that's done
then she's prosecuted on the obscenity
charge and she's found guilty so the
ohio supreme court took the case
and our supreme court four judges of the
seven
found that she was not constitutionally
convicted
but under our particular procedure where
there is an
affirmance
then we need six of the seven
jurists to hold this unconstitutional so
even though map got a majority of the
ohio supreme court to agree with her
on first amendment grounds she didn't
win the case
so her lawyers appeal the case to the
united states supreme court which takes
the case and again
in the mix are both the first amendment
argument that her conviction for
obscenity is unconstitutional
because these materials were protected
by the first amendment and her
conviction was invalid
or on the other hand a fourth amendment
argument that the evidence had to be
suppressed
because it was obtained in violation of
the fourth amendment so there were those
two separate issues in the case
so the u.s supreme court decides to take
the case on fourth amendment grounds
rather than the first amendment issue
mapview ohio was decided in 1961. this
is the warren court that's going to go
on two years later to decide terry v
ohio about stop and frisk it's going to
decide miranda versus arizona
a lot of these decisions setting up
fundamental rights in particular for
criminal defendants
they hold that the police violated the
fourth amendment by entering her home
without a warrant that they had no
justification for
failing to get a warrant and therefore
that the remedy they were going to apply
was the exclusionary rule they were
going to suppress the evidence
because it had been obtained in
violation of the fourth amendment
mafia ohio is definitely one of the
major decisions of the warren court
and it's a huge decision in terms of
taking a constitutional right
and then applying a particular remedy
which the fourth amendment does not say
you exclude the evidence
and applying that remedy to all state
prosecutions there was a big reaction to
mapping ohio especially
among law enforcement they were really
upset about the fact
claiming that this was really going to
impair their ability as law enforcement
to carry out their jobs it was going to
let the criminals
go free mapview ohio did not change the
substance of the fourth amendment
it didn't change any of the rules about
what the police are allowed to do
when they can enter your home and when
they need a warrant so if the police had
been already complying with this
constitutional requirements
map the ohio wouldn't have changed much
of anything the only thing that changed
was the remedy
they're not going to be able to use this
evidence in court anymore and the fact
that law enforcement reacted with such
consternation
was a significant piece of evidence that
they were regularly violating people's
fourth amendment rights
the fact of the matter is that
we are as citizens of ohio deprived
of our constitutional rights against
unlawful search and seizure
when you look at dowry map's case and in
particular the way things happen you see
that
when there was no remedy that the police
cared about
for enforcing the fourth amendment then
the police pretty casually disregarded
it
it was just something written on paper
and didn't have any really bite when you
got into court
the other case that i always tell my
students about is a smaller case that
nobody knows about
state versus keeling decided in 1962
by an ohio court of common pleas and
what's interesting about the case is
it features a lot of the same characters
as matthew ohio
you've got sergeant carl de lau you've
got shondor burns the numbers runner and
you've got the same prosecutors in
matthew ohio they suspect that there's
gambling going on in a particular suite
in cleveland didn't go get a warrant
they go down there they break in they
search sure enough they find a bunch of
gambling things
the raid in that case happens a couple
months after map v
ohio is argued in the u.s supreme court
and one month
before the case is decided by the u.s
supreme court i don't know if carl de
lao knew what was happening in
washington or not
but while the u.s supreme court was
considering that maybe we need to start
excluding evidence if you don't get
warrants carl de lau was up to the exact
same thing back in cleveland
dahl remap is this fantastic example of
a
a woman who insisted that the police try
to follow the constitution to protect
her rights and to take it to the united
states supreme court and ultimately
prevail and make the police do things
the way that the
constitution says that they're supposed
to do them
