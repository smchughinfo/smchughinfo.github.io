[Music]
right
well good afternoon everyone
case you think this looks a little
different it is we are in marion
ohio today uh 100 years ago
at this moment presidential campaign was
going on
between marion native warren g
harding who owned the marian star
and james cox from dayton who owned the
dayton
daily news and it was an all-ohio
all-ohio show so i'm gonna have fran uh
talk a little bit about uh mrs harding
well it's kind of fun to be here today
in her in their home
you know warren harding and florence
harding built this house
the year that they were married in 1891.
um you know florence was a pretty much a
modern woman
she worked with her husband at the
marion star
he was the owner publisher and she
worked with him
and she was also helped her husband on
campaigns and she liked to
campaign and share recipes
um the favorite recipe i think that
the many people associate with mrs
harding was one of warren harding's
favorite recipes
and that was his recipe for waffles
he had this saying that was his favorite
recipe but he had this saying
you eat the first 14 waffles without
syrup but with lots of butter
then you put syrup on the next nine and
the last half dozen you eat swimming
with butter
eaten that way waffles never hurt
anybody
so i think that that's kind of a fun
thing and when the when the school kids
go through this
old home they love reading that quote
from warren harding
the waffle iron uh still sits on the gas
stove
and it's just kind of a cool thing i
have to say i've made this recipe for
mike a couple of times just to try it
out
and the secret to the lightness of it is
that she beat the egg whites separately
and then folded them in
so and many times she served it as a
main dish
um you know not just with syrup but with
a dried beef
gravy over waffles which is which is one
of his favorites
mrs harding was also very active in the
suffrage movement
um and she was you know i have my
suffrage pin on today
and she was the very first first lady to
vote for her husband for president
talking about the waffles makes me
hungry so
ohio has 13 presidential sites
including the harding center so you can
visit ohiohistory.org
and look for presidential trail and
you'll be able to see
all of those locations something that
fran and i have done with our kids and
it's a lot of
a lot a lot of fun um maybe they kind of
set the stage in 1920
again two ohioans uh running world war
one
was over um the country has just
gotten through the what was then called
the spanish flu
the league of nations was still a hot
issue and would turn out again to be a
hot issue during
during that presidential campaign uh
some of the people who dominated the
political scene were
were gone or leaving um former president
theodore roosevelt died in 1919
at actually at a young age
woodrow wilson was still present but he
had suffered a stroke
uh and he was pretty much in seclusion
uh at the white house uh as fran said
um the election of
1920 was uh right after
uh women were granted the right to vote
and uh as fran said it was the first
time
um a spouse had been able to vote for
the other spouse
for for for president um
we're going to hear in a moment a little
bit about
the campaign fran i decided to do it out
here on the porch
because this is where harding campaigned
um
some days he was he was gone uh out
campaigning but many days he was right
here and uh
people chartered trains and other things
to bring people in
uh and there's some pictures that we'll
show you in a minute
uh with this whole area out here really
filled up with
what looks like at least thousands and
thousands of
of people um
let me give you an idea a hundred years
ago october 8 1920.
uh on this date harding was not actually
here
uh he was away from his front porch
campaign giving speeches
in saint joe st joseph missouri and then
he would go on tonight
to kansas city then he was headed from
there to the southwest by rail
james cox the democrat candidate was in
bloomington
indiana today for his third barnstorming
trip
into that state and uh for baseball fans
in those days when the world series was
played in the first week in october
the cleveland indians were battling the
brooklyn dodgers in the world series
this was game five and it was starting
right now
at two o'2 o'clock
let me now turn to sherry hall
who was the site manager for the harding
home and presidential center
uh sheri is the author of warren g
harding and the marian
daily star how newspapering shaped a
present
sheriff thank you very much for for
joining us
thank you governor i'm actually in the
house right behind you i'm in one of the
upstairs rooms there
and i'm in a room that florence harding
used during the campaign
as kind of a home office and she was
very instrumental in that very busy
campaign giving lots of interviews
of course talking to particularly women
voters
who were going to be casting a ballot
for the very first time that year
to give you a little sense about the
campaign and what it was like
it's totally opposite of what we do
today
when the candidate goes out and gives
speeches everywhere
most the time hardeen is going to stay
here and he'll
entertain thousands of people at one
time who are going to come mostly by
train but some also
venture over ohio's rather suspect roads
and drive here to marion they're gonna
gather before that front porch that the
governor standing on
and five to ten thousand people at a
time
twice a week over the course of the
three-month campaign that's all it was
three months more than six hundred
thousand people
came to marion ohio to listen to him and
give a speech from that very porch
that had been good for business too i
imagine
yes marion's economy did really well
that summer and fall
well that that that really um is great
now some of the time
uh we looked this up and apparently
today he was not campaigning here so
some of the time he must have left here
and gone out and campaigned
is that right he did he and a lot of
folks don't know that he did go off the
front porch
kind of intermittently during the
campaign
to visit other states he would go by
rail in three or four day trips
and then come back to the porch he would
increase that a little bit
through october he ended up visiting 13
other states
mostly he's in charge of the midwest and
the southwest
and his running mate calvin coolidge is
going to take care of speaking
engagements
in the northeast he's not going to even
venture into the south because
that's democratic territory and none of
them
are going to be swing states for the
republicans that year
the solid south for the democrats
absolutely
for many many many years uh tell us a
little bit about the house when was it
built who built it
well the hardings were the first and
only owners
of the house until it came into the
hands of
a private group called the hardy
memorial association
in 1925 after mrs harding died
the hardings had the house built in 1891
then during the year they he and
florence were engaged to be married
and they were married actually right
inside the front door there
by the stairs they lived there for the
next 30 years
so it's very much not a presidential
house
it's a newspaper owner's house a small
businessman's house
it's not one of the fanciest houses in
marion it's a pretty ordinary house
which gives us a great insight into how
just
ordinary folks lived at that time in
history
so you're going through restoration now
and uh you've just built a visitor
center here
how was that how was that funded well
we've done a lot here the past two or
three years we have done a complete
restoration of the harding home
so it will look as much as possible as
how it looked during the 1920 campaign
that includes the grounds as well at the
same time
we have constructed a new building the
warren g harding presidential library
museum
which is adjacent to the harding home
a wonderful partnership went into the
building of this
pro the new building and the restoration
it's about half and half state state
capital funds and the rest was private
donations uh so we really depended upon
both of those avenues of revenues
in completing this project so fran and i
had the chance just a moment ago
literally to to look at
um visitor center we looked into a
couple rooms uh
really really well done uh when will
people be able to see this we are
working toward
opening um what we've done here is
basically we're opening a brand new
historic site
uh it's much different than what we just
what we've been
operating for the past 50 years or so
which is just a house museum
so in addition to trying to open up a
new site you've had covid to deal with
us everyone else has so we are working
our way to our opening
can't tell you an opening day yet but as
soon as we
know that we'll let people know
well that's great well thank you for
what you're you've done
you've been here a few years i know you
told me how many years
i've been here 20 thanks for bringing
that up
or you're you're a veteran you're a
better veteran maybe i should have just
said that
yes but uh you know but going back to
when i was uh
in the united states congress and marion
was in my congressional district
i've always been really impressed by the
dedication
uh and the pride that the people in
marion have in this home
uh in this history um and in
warren g harding so it's a it's a really
you know when you talk about a
public-private partnership it's really a
great thing to see
and uh thank you for all that you've
done
you're very welcome we look forward to
the time when this can open up and
everybody can come see it we look
forward to that too thank you governor
we appreciate it thank you very much let
me now turn to dayton
i bring in mary kay mabe who is a
professor
at sinclair community college uh she
teaches ohio history
and teaches about james cox
um mary kay thank you very much for
for being on thank you for inviting me
governor
well tell us tell us a little bit uh you
know the person who loses
in a presidential race you know doesn't
have the prominence
later on and but tell us a little bit
about
james cox founder of what is now
cox enterprises all the cox newspapers
for many many years
and tell us tell us a little bit about
that and then maybe about
uh the campaign from the point of view
of james cox
and uh before we do that he had an
interesting running mate
uh i don't know if you brought the
picture you bring the picture with you
yeah you have it there we'll see i can
show it to you here
yeah yeah running mate of course is
franklin
a young franklin roosevelt uh and
this picture i believe was taken in
dayton right uh
and this was during the time when what
he was officially
notified of course he knew he got the
nomination but
uh right so tell us a little bit about
that about that day
and um about cox okay
um he was born in a really small
community right
outside of middletown called jacksonburg
and it's a
real small town i i believe last time i
looked at its population was
uh 2000 and it was a population of 27
people but the homestead still there
and uh he completed his high school
education
and uh he actually taught for a while
and on weekends then he would work for
his brother-in-law
at a middletown newspaper and he
he grew to enjoy being an um a
journalist
more so than being a teacher and so
uh he had an opportunity one time to
cover a story
and at that time it was i believe it was
a train wreck
and so in order to hold on to the
the telegraph lines he had the
telegraph operator start transmitting
the bible until he could come back
and and recapture the
the the lines and and actually
file his story that's one way to beat
the competition right yes
yeah you hang on on onto the line so so
he ends up with the date and paper
right right right but before he ended up
with the dayton paper he was actually a
special assistant uh
to a congressman to washington d.c um
a gentleman by the name of paul sorg and
he um
he he made some very interesting
acquaintances when he was in washington
dc but he told
paul sword that he always wanted to have
his own newspaper
so paul sorg helped him finance the
purchase of the dayton
evening news and he purchased the
newspaper
and once he purchased it he found out
the subscribership
wasn't quite what was reported but he
made a success of it
and as time went on then he started to
use his newspaper
to kind of combat some local
social issues and he caught the
attention of the local democratic party
and the local democratic party in dayton
then
asked him to be a candidate for the at
that time
it was the third ohio congressional
district it's the district that mike
turner has today and
it actually remained the third district
for a long long long time after that is
yeah yeah as well so
ends up 1920 he's governor of ohio
right um and tell us a little bit about
that picture that we saw
what was going on that day that was a
big big celebration in dayton
as the campaign was really rolling
that's the day that he was notified
officially of his of his nomination of
um
being the democratic candidate he knew
uh from back in july but this was in
august when franklin roosevelt came to
town and
they started if anybody's familiar with
dayton they started down
by the river on monument street and main
street
and they walked
the the distance between that location
down to the fairgrounds and the
event was supposed to start at two
o'clock but by the time they got there
it was four o'clock
because they stopped and said hi to
everyone
and he had a speech all prepared it was
about 8 000 words long
and by the time he was able to give his
speech
the weather started to change and
he had to cut it short because the storm
clouds were moving in
but that was the day that he officially
began uh began his
uh his campaign and that was august
of that year and he would campaign um
mostly on pretty big significant trips
right
yeah he would um he and franklin
roosevelt
would uh pick a coast one started on the
east coast one started on the west coast
and they just kind of crossed back and
forth
their goal was to hit every state they
possibly could
and wright state has a really
interesting map
in their special collections and archive
that shows all the different locations
that they
they visited along that campaign well
well that's great i'll go back to that
picture because um
uh you know it it to me is a very
significant picture
because franklin roosevelt uh not much
over a year i believe after that got
polio
and of course never walked really on his
own completely
um again and so
here you see this youthful uh tall
a good-looking guy and um you know then
a lot a lot was ahead of him in the
future of course in
fortune president but also uh you know
that next year got polio and had to
fight back and fight his way back
back from that so well thank you very
much
we we we appreciate it uh uh
really appreciate that and thank you
both of you coming in
thank you so so very very much um let's
go
uh eric if we can to look at uh the
results of that election
and uh we'll look at um
both ohio and we'll look at the u.s
pull those maps up
a presidential election as you basically
can see
pretty much the solid south want for the
democrat
james cox and then harding uh looks like
carried
pretty much everything everything else
let's take a look at ohio
uh again the red is
harding blue is blue as cox
and you know pretty much it looks like a
landslide in ohio
as as well
before we come back to the present
this book uh journey through my ears by
james cox
written in 1946 i believe
and i just i was looking through it
yesterday and came across this part
this is a cox describing what happened
after he
got the nomination
after cox got the nomination
senator harding gave a
public statement saying and i quote
governor cox's nomination is an added
consideration shown to our great state
of ohio
for which i'm glad and gives reasonable
assurance
that finally a newspaper man is to be
made the nation's
chiefs executive ohio is accorded to
governor cox for unusual distinction and
he deserved his notable victory
at san francisco where the convention
was his nomination will not in any way
change our activities in ohio
is a great party contest before us to be
fought on great principles involved and
neither place of residence
nor personality will have any marked
influence on the result
so that was a that was a comment from
senator harding
and in in the book cox goes on right
after that to say
this was characteristic of warren g
harding
he was a warm-hearted man with most
gracious impulses
he was not one to harbor grievances or
deliberately do injury to any man
he had advanced from state senator to
lieutenant governor and then to the
united states senate
to him that was the ideal public
assignment
now many unkind things have been said
and written to mr harding
harsh criticism is the penalty laid upon
most public men
the scandals of his administration
inspired many an accusing word
against his character that he was
amiable to the point of weakness that he
lacked vigilance that he permitted
himself
unfit associates cannot be denied but he
was an honest man
and while the conduct of many close to
him was reprehensible
his own official record was never
tarnished
with dishonor so
i just found out that interesting 100
years ago
back to today we'll start off
eric with the slides from for today's
data and as you can see
sadly the number of cases
has is continues to go up we're above
1500 for the day
uh the average is now pushing 1100 so
we've seen this
spike go up um and
not something that we certainly want to
see 13 deaths reported since yesterday
there were
109 new hospitalizations 11 new icu
admissions reported in the last
24 hours let's look eric
at the counties by incidents we'll start
with
again with the top the top 20
and then we will look at the
top 88 but if you look at the top 20
again you'll find mostly rural counties
you'll find counties at the top that
have
two and a half times to almost three
times
the number of cases for the last two
weeks above uh
what the cdc says is high incidence so
very frankly these these numbers are
very
uh very alarming um i want to take a
moment to talk about
the positivity um positivity
uh was has been was going down for quite
some time and we were we were just
delighted
again this is if you take the total
number of cases for the day
the tests and then you look at what
percentage actually came back
positive to date our lowest positivity
was in mid to late september
when our single day uh rate dipped to
2.5 percent
several different times our weekly
average was 2.7
and that was really great news it was
2.7
for the week of september 18th today our
daily positivity
was 3.9 percent almost current day
and a seven day rolling average is 3.3
reflects the ongoing increasing trend of
virus spread that we're seeing
uh throughout the state of ohio so these
numbers are
not good uh eric let's go to the public
health alert
system and we'll look at our map as you
look at it on your left
uh is last week to the right is
this week and you can see uh we're
getting a lot
unfortunately we're getting a lot more
red
uh in there eric let's look at the next
slide
so this is uh as of today
um we're announcing 18 red counties
the highest number we've seen since the
week of july 23rd
and now there are 58 orange counties
this week the highest ever
the virus is spreading in more areas of
the state
and impacting a wider swath of
ohio
again as we talk to public health
departments
what they tell us when they try to drill
down on the causes of this spread
lacks social distancing not enough
people wearing masks
not enough people following quarantine
and isolation guidance
um let's look uh eric at our next slide
if we could
what we've done with this slide
is you will see that the
we've only put on the slide the red
which are the red counties
and the other counties that you see
there in
orange i guess those are high incidence
counties
so if you're watching this at home these
would be the counties
that if you live in one of these
counties you would worry about because
they have a high end
either they have a high incidence uh or
they are
a red a red county which meets means
they meet many of the seven
seven indicators so these are the
counties that were particularly
most most concerned about
again talking with local health
departments a lot of the spread we're
seeing is being driven by everyday
activities that
certainly seem benign seem innocent
having neighbors over for a backyard
barbecue
meeting up with friends after a sporting
event or going to a birthday party with
family
these are all some of the leading causes
of
the spread we're seeing there's also
increased spread among families and
households
in churches and at after school
activities and sports
we're seeing these gatherings many times
are turning
into outbreaks in half of our new
red counties there are outbreaks related
to funerals or weddings let me just say
that again and half of our new red
counties are outbreaks related to
funerals
or to weddings uh in one example
we heard about recently uh and this is
just break
that absolutely breaks your heart uh i'm
not saying where it was
but somewhere in ohio uh a wedding took
place
a lot of people and
ended up with two of the grandfathers
uh of the couple uh died as a result of
covert
it just is horrible
uh as of this week 96
of ohioans are living in a red or an
orange county
um that's 26 percent in our 18 red
counties and 70 percent in our orange
counties
only four percent of ohioans are in the
12 yellow
counties the portion of ohioans living
in counties with elevated risk levels
has steadily increased since
august when we saw a law in cases as you
can see
from what's happened with with this
chart
to live with a virus look we need to
adjust
our routines we can live with this virus
but we've got scott to be very careful
that may mean reconsidering attending a
crowded event
reconsidering going to a party and if
you happen to get sick
please help the local health department
do the tracing that is absolutely
crucial and necessary
basic prevention measures hold true
today as they did at the beginning of
the pandemic
uh you know the basic principles are the
same that we've talked about keep a
distance
wear the mask wash your hands
avoid big gatherings uh just it's the
same
same things we're going to look now
specifically
at our new red counties and we'll start
in order
of incidents and the first is central
ohio and
fayette county fayette county now
is almost at three times
in the last two weeks they're almost at
three times the high
incident level of the cdc there are 291
cases per hundred they're read for the
first time this week
they've just they've just jumped up uh
local health department officials
told us yesterday they have outbreaks in
a small school
cases associated with a funeral in a
large
family outbreak as of yesterday there
were eight residents hospitalized in two
sadly in intensive care
right here in marion marion county
marion county is read for the second
time this week
local health department officials said
they're adding 10 to 15 cases per day
10 to 15 new cases per day and that
several are connected to multiple
outbreaks including
churches day cares and a dental office
you're also seeing multiple cases in
families and some cases a few cases in
schools
number three down into lawrence county
southern tip of ohio lawrence county
returns to red this week for the first
time since the week of july 30th
county health officials said they have
had outbreaks associated with a funeral
after-school activities and with church
functions
the community has spread throughout
the local health commissioner said and i
quote
the virus is running through families
like i've never
seen before
let's turn back to central ohio madison
in madison county
again madison county with a a very high
high rate
they're read for the first time this
week local health department officials
said they are seeing high occurrence of
spread in families
they attribute that in part to people
starting just
starting to spend more time indoors
ross county ross county has read for the
first time this week
county health department officials said
they're seeing a few cases
associated with the prison and others
associated with social gatherings such
as backyard barbecues
and overnight sleepovers cases have
increased from seven
to ten a day three weeks ago is what it
was now to 14 to 15 cases
per day let's go up north to portage
county
portage county returns to red this week
local health department officials report
that kent state
is partnering with cvs health to provide
free testing for students staff
and faculty starting october 12th so
again
that's a great opportunity to get tested
each week
450 students will be randomly selected
for testing
the city of kent health department
officials also report that in recent
weeks they're seeing cases start
to creep into an older population not
just the students and again
this is what we've been concerned with
not only concerned about the students
and faculty
but then the spread out in to the
community
county health department officials also
said they're seeing communities spread
over into the mahoning valley mahoning
county has read for the first time this
week
health department officials said they
have had multiple outbreaks including an
out of county wedding with 18
18 associated cases ranging
to other states and counties the wedding
now
also a secondary spread associated with
it
two separate funerals two separate
funerals have also
have cases associated with them there
have been outbreaks tied to a group home
and outbreaks tied to a birthday party
in addition to the large parties there
has been spread inside family units
and not necessarily the households where
people live but in extended families
in other households health department
officials said that school districts
have been doing
an excellent job as i have i think
pretty much throughout the state in
keeping the spread minimal
however as we've said many times our
schools are a reflection of our
communities
and if there is widespread spread in the
community the schools simply
have no way of keeping it out also in
the
mahoning valley staying in the mahoning
valley let's go to trumbull county
trumbull county increased from yellow to
red this week
the county was read last was last read
the week of august 20th
local health department officials report
an outbreak of 22 cases
with a school sports team the outbreak
involves 11 players three coaches and
expanded to four students not on the
team and four parents
one coach had to be hospitalized school
administrators
have been very cooperative the health
department is assigning a nurse to work
with the schools
but they have at least one case in a
third of the school districts
at least one case in a third of the
school districts in the county
there are also continued community
events happening which can lead to
increased
virus transmission
let's talk for a moment about flu shots
and i think we have some
some good news coming out of our
counties mercer county
hosted a record-breaking flu vaccination
clinic at the fairgrounds this week
congratulations local health department
officials report that they had 872
mercer county residents who got their
flu shots at the drive-through clinic
this shatters their old record of 623
doses given
in 2019. athens county
the city of athens congratulations more
than 300 people were vaccinated during
just a few hours at the athens city
county health department's first
drive-thru clinic
i want to thank these health departments
for what they're doing and other health
departments as well
and just encourage everyone right now
to get get your flu shot there are many
opportunities in the community we've got
some drug stores that are doing it
and other places but please this is the
time
the health experts tell us to get the
flu shot just go ahead
and get the flu shot very important
so before fran i came to marion today
after we left cedarville we stopped in
hardin county and
wyandotte county uh we were able to
spend some time
uh with the ohio department of natural
resources
many of the great folks there mary merch
who heads up the department
uh we also were with ducks unlimited
ducks unlimited
has been a great partner of the states
uh
and put some real money in helping
develop our wetlands
um which help us as we
work to clean up lake erie and deal with
the algae bloom in
in lake erie we visited
the site of a future h2 ohio wetland
complex
near the andreas wildlife area
eric is showing some slides now odnr and
dups unlimited
which has expertise in restoring
wetlands are leading the project
and we're grateful for as i said for
this partnership
building and restoring wetlands is an
important piece of our
h-2 ohio water quality initiative
because they naturally
and cost effectively improve
our water by trapping by filtering
and removing excess pollution and
nutrients such as phosphorus that
contribute to harmful
algae blooms on one of our shows in the
future
i'll put up a map that i saw today that
shows where we have
started or planning to start these new
wetlands
and we will be able to continue that
this
particular wetland complex with several
new and restored wetlands will be
developed at the headwaters of the
blanchard river which flows into

i think we're now ready uh ready for
questions
governor first question today is from
marty schlayton at the ohio capitol
journal
good afternoon governor um it's a little
serendipitous that you started with the
1920 election and noted that
both the men running were newsmen um i
wanted to ask you about
the 2020 election um and uh
your uh status in it um
aren't you trying to have it both ways
with donald trump um on the one hand you
say you're supporting him
and you praise him for things you think
are praiseworthy
but you don't want to comment on the
very very controversial things
and does um so isn't that trying to have
it both
ways and would we be doing our jobs as
journalists if we didn't ask you about
this
well marty you have your job and i
respect that job and i respect your
question
um look um
everybody i've ever voted for for
president there are some things that i
might not have agreed with them on
um everyone has to make a choice
um i've spelled out i think very clearly
uh some of the things that i think
donald trump has done
exceedingly well um i've talked about
because i know about this
and it's i personally have knowledge of
this
last night the vice presidential debate
vice president pence has led this effort
we're on the phone
every single week democrat and
republican governors with the vice
president
they do everything they can to get us
whatever
resources uh that they have when we've
asked them well i've asked them for
something
they've done that so that's my personal
experience
big big picture
you know i'm very happy with who donald
trump has put on the courts
you know he made a commitment to the
people of ohio and the country
many people voted for him the first time
because of that commitment he's kept
that commitment
he's put people who believe in the
constitution who know they're not
legislators
very qualified individuals his last
supreme court nominee
judge barrett certainly fits fits that
as well
the economy look we've we've gone down
we all know why we've gone down because
of the virus
but donald trump negotiated and was
tough
in negotiations and it took a lot of
guts to do it because
when you're going in to have a new
negotiations you don't get everything
you want
uh and sometimes there is sacrifice and
sometimes some people are hurt
uh but i think the president had the
attitude that we've got to be tougher in
our negotiations
and i think by and large those
negotiations have
have gone well i've made it clear
that i nobody
in the in the media team um
that's calling in from all over the
state mostly around columbus but from
other parts of the state
should have any doubt where i what i
think about mass should have any doubt
what i think about social distancing
should have any doubt uh about you know
what i think about this virus
twice it every week i'm here answering
questions
uh and i've been adamant about this and
i've gotten a lot of criticism uh about
that um donald trump has not taken those
same positions
obviously he and i don't agree uh on
on some of those things so those things
i think are
are obvious uh but like every every
american
in the end i'm voting for one or two
people
and i'm very happy to be voting uh for
donald trump for the reasons that i said
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
governor governor
just curious within the next week or so
should we be expecting
any changes to the alcohol sales curfew
and secondly wondering if you saw that
the fda issued a warning letter to patel
for its mask
sanitation units uh earlier this week
and wanted to see if you'd care to
comment on yeah
yeah as soon as i saw the patel news uh
yesterday you all reported
uh i got on the phone with the ceo of
patel and uh we had a conversation about
it
um he's going to keep me informed uh
about what is going on
you know their their position uh is that
there's not a problem but
you know that has to play out and uh
you know i know that they have
supplied an awful lot of masks at a
period of time
when we didn't have masks literally
didn't have mass
uh cover we're in a much better position
than than we were today
but they filled in a hole at a very very
crucial time
so you know this is not
excuse me my area of expertise and we'll
let the fda work this out
and we'll see we'll see what happens
in regard to alcohol i have a call
this afternoon with the ohio restaurant
association i'm going to listen to them
uh and what what they have to say um
you know if you look at where we're
seeing
a lot of the spread uh the things that i
mentioned today
uh it's not that we don't have spread uh
you'll come out bars or restaurants
but if you look at the things we talk
about the most
their funerals their weddings they're
big gatherings
um they're all the things that i
mentioned earlier
uh so there's a lot of things that are
causing spread
uh in in ohio in ohio today and so we're
trying to weigh
you know the balance we have small
business men and women
uh we know we're in this we're into the
football season
uh we know this extra time that people
could spend in a bar
is important to businesses but we also
have to balance that out as
and and this really is no different than
any other decision that we've made
uh every decision that we've made has
been a balance
and they're not easy decisions so we're
going to listen to them this afternoon
and
we'll we'll see next question
is from laura bischoff at the dayton
daily news um
governor um so i was curious uh if the
trump campaign has discussed with you or
any of your leaders
um or your team rather any contingency
plans
to um to kind of litigate uh
the election results um you know what
happens if we don't have
clear results uh in the 10 days
following
election night and um
you know how confident are you that we
can count the ballots
and determine the winner by mid december
well i'm pretty confident that we can do
this in ohio uh
you know my knowledge of elections uh
you know is only what i read uh
beyond ohio but uh we've been able to do
this consistently in ohio
uh we're seeing a lot of people vote
absentee
we're seeing a lot of people as you all
reported i think i saw it first in the
day daily news the pictures yesterday uh
excuse me
tuesday uh morning when people were
lined up to vote
and um you know a lot of people are
going to have voted already
by by election day and um my guess is it
will not be as crowded on election day
um ohio allows votes
uh to be you get those when they get
these votes in
they can get them ready they can't run
them but they can run them
after 7 30. and so i think by 8 30
you're going to see a lot of votes
come in from ohio most of them probably
the early absentee ballots but those
absentee ballots i'm sure
are going to be more than we've ever
seen before so i'm not
i'm not concerned about it we have
democrats and republicans from the
precinct level um
you know to the counties that
are doing a good job and we're proud of
the job that we do
here in the state of ohio i've had no
discussion no discussion with anyone
uh from the trump campaign uh about
legal
any any particulars about legal filings
or anything like
that next question
is from dan derose at w-o-i-o in
cleveland
and let me just say let me if i could
just add to that
i've never been involved in any campaign
uh presidential
where each side didn't have lawyers
lined up
so that should not shock any of us if
both sides have lawyers ready
ready to go in in each state um you know
every every
campaign in ohio i've ever seen uh there
are lawyers lined up
uh from each side ready to go just in
case something happens and somebody
needs to go
into court so the fact that lawyers are
getting ready to do something should not
i don't think cause us a lot of in of
itself should not cause us a lot of
alarm
who's next i'm sorry uh good afternoon
governor uh dan derose with cleveland
team cleveland 19 news uh while this is
my first question
i'd like you to know that every day we
bring your live news conferences to
northeast ohio and so i want to thank
you
for your continued public access to give
everybody the latest information
with that said i'd like to get your
reaction on news
that has come out of michigan today uh
six individuals arrested
indicted by the fbi for what appears to
be an attempted
kidnapping of governor whitmer in that
state
it went as far as these individuals
preparing
ied devices testing them out
this appears to be a plot that even
touches ohio there was a meeting
according to the affidavit
a meeting that was held in dublin just
outside of columbus
what is your reaction that the
quote-unquote michigan militia was so
upset at the way governor
whitmer has handled things in michigan
that
this was an attempted kidnapping plot
get your reaction to that and have you
been informed of
any similar type of threats to your own
safety
well it's shocking um this is just this
is horrible
um you know thank heavens
officials took the appropriate action uh
to stop this from taking place
um all i know is what i read
an hour ago i was following the story
but it is a
despicable act it is horrible
and you know everyone has to denounce
this
this is you know if you want to talk
about
you know our political process
this is outside our political process
we we have a great process we have a
great
system we're a nation of laws
and people can disagree with the
governor as many ohioans do with this
governor
and go about it you know the proper way
they can demonstrate and that's fine
they can file actions in court
they can file things in the state
legislature um
but this act is just it's uh it's
frightening
it's frightening and so i'm
yeah this is horrible
next question is from laura hancock at
cleveland.com
good afternoon governor i have a little
bit more of a specific question
about the previous question um they did
these these people who were accused of
plotting to kidnap governor whitmer
did meet in ohio and i was just
wondering
um whether you were aware of that
um and also um do your does your
security staff ever think that you
were in any danger
um laura the one thing i learned a
number of years ago when i was
lieutenant governor with george
vornovich
is that you never talk about security
so i'm not going to talk about security
but i was not aware of anything
absolutely had no knowledge
um about that at all
um no absolutely nothing i mean when i
first i just
i read the story as i said an hour or so
ago and saw a double in the
dublin ohio i said oh my oh yeah
no i don't know i you know and i don't
know where these people are from that
were arrested
it was not reported yet so i know only
what's been reported in the news media
i've not been briefed by anybody
about it it's despicable it's wrong it's
horrible
next question is from kevin landers at
wbns
in columbus hello governor
hey kevin hey uh so franklin county
we've got a problem here with
um voters who have been mailed the
incorrect ballot and franklin county is
trying to figure out
uh how many were sent the incorrect
ballot and it raises
questions uh by many about the safety of
voting by mail
i'd like you to weigh in on what you
what you know about the situation
and what the messages you have to voters
uh who are
probably going to be skeptical about the
ballots that they receive
well i know only what i've read um i've
not received any
specific briefing from the secretary of
state on it
so i don't have anything to add uh to
that
look i i would say that i i believe
uh that your ballot is is secure
um
mailing it in uh we stopped at fran and
i stopped at our uh
daughter one of our daughters and and
son-in-law and they i saw right on the
counter there they had just gotten in
their their absentee ballots and they're
sending them in and i know a lot of
ohioans are going to do that i don't
think ohioans should feel
in any way concerned about that
if someone still feels concerned though
you know they can go today
and go to the board of elections and
vote
if they want to do it on a sunday they
can wait until later and vote on a
sunday before the election
or they can wait till election day and
uh as what fran i usually do at least uh
and and vote on election day and have 13
hours to vote
so i think there's many opportunities
for people to vote uh i mean
and our system works
it doesn't mean that there can't be a
problem
but our system works and it works very
well and i think people should have
confidence in it
next question is from jim province at
the toledo blade
hello governor thanks again hey jim um
you you you discussed the security
concerns uh that might have surrounded
you but i'm curious i mean there was a
lot of discussion about
potential security risks with uh dr
acton
before she resigned um how extensive
were those concerns did anything
was there any rumbling of something
similar like this surrounding her
and did that play a role in her decision
to resign and i'm curious as to whether
or not that played a role in your later
choice
opting not to take the job of health
director
well i don't want to go too far down the
road here because i really do believe
that it's important not to have a public
discussion about security issues
but i don't want there to be a
misunderstanding
there was no case that
was anywhere near this uh
that i'm aware of uh in regard to dr
acton
or myself so i'm not aware of anything
that was even
you know even even closer than that um
look you you know you
you get people sometimes who say things
that they clearly
uh you know go beyond the first
amendment but
nothing like this nothing like this i
don't want anybody to think there has
been
next question is from jeff reddick at
wsyx
in columbus hey jeff
hello governor good afternoon you may
have seen as well i know you're trying
to keep up with a lot of news today as
we are
um the changing nature of the next
presidential debate
um mainly with that it seemed that the
debate
came into question and the date came
into question because president trump
did not want to
quote waste his time with a virtual
debate um and that's kind of thrown
things into doubt about the next debate
uh you've of course embraced this
virtual model i'm
curious your thoughts on not embracing
the virtual model at the federal level
yeah this is a developing story i mean
i'm not sure i know everything about it
um look in my childhood
i think one of the on the nixon kennedy
debates was one was on one coast and one
was on the other
uh i mean so i guess i don't i don't see
a problem with it
um
you know i don't know again i'm not not
sure i've read everything that's
occurred today but if you're asking me
about
a remote debate can you do it i think
certainly you could do it
uh you know it may not be ideal uh but
you certainly you certainly can do it um
but again i haven't really followed it
that closely today
next question is uh from jesse palmer at
the cincinnati enquirer
hello governor so there are about 1500
new coronavirus cases reported since
yesterday and you mentioned the higher
positivity rate i guess why are we
seeing this rise what are the things
that you're most concerned about that
ohioans should be aware of
jesse thank you for the question uh i am
deeply concerned about what i'm seeing
um i know that there's some people who
you know sell
it goes to wine again he's you know he's
talking about this
but go back and look at the maps i would
just ask anybody
who doesn't think this is very serious
to go look at the maps and what we have
seen
is a spread that continues and if you
look at
take a look at the map that shows the
counties that are high
incidents which means over that mark
and some of them are almost three times
over that mark
uh mercer county has been on this list
now red list for 10 weeks so what we're
starting to see
in some of these counties is long long
term
set in of a very very high level
and so if you take the counties that
have a high incidence
and you then add in the red counties
it's a lot of counties that's a big
significant part of the state of ohio
so you know you look at those numbers as
a gut punch
uh it just yeah i'm very very concerned
about this
why is it happening we went through it
today
uh people are not being careful i mean
think about the tragedy i mean i just
i can't fathom this but think about the
tragedy of people getting married and
then
two of the grandfathers are dead i mean
we're not blaming anybody but this is
look this is this has got to stop
this has just got to stop i mean these
lives are valuable
these lives matter
we we can do better than this now we
have done well as ohioans
and you know we don't want to be all
gloom and doom we've done well
and we've taken us to this point but
we're now at a point
where it's getting colder
people are more inside we're now
starting to see what we feared
from some of our colleges and from our
schools and that is
a child you know a young person getting
sick okay it's one thing a 20 year old
gets sick
not anything to something to take
seriously
but then that 20 year old goes and
infects a 50 year old
or 60 year old or a 70 year old or
there's someone in their family
and nobody does this on purpose but so
many of the people who have it
don't really have have any indication
that they've got it
so what you're seeing in ohio is
widespread
spread and we're heading into winter so
yeah i
am very very concerned and i would just
say this
we have got ohio we have gotten this far
we have done well
we've not gone over the edge we've not
seen that fire flare up
um but it's it's
it's starting to come that fire is
starting to come
and it's not coming not not just uh you
know it's now in our
rural areas you know it's it's
everywhere
um so yeah i'm very very concerned it's
coming from the things that we talked
about which is basically
people you know not social distancing
going into large groups and seeing
200 300 people at a wedding funeral
um and look
people might say look mike don't you
have to don't we have to go
about our lives and yeah we do that's
the point
we can go about our lives we can do
almost anything we want
and the biggest threat to not doing we
will do almost everything we want is if
we're careless
and we see this spread get so high and
that's what i'm fearful of
i'm fearful of the spread will get high
look we've allowed
schools and we've said we believe in
local control of our schools
and so the schools have made the
decision the schools and the parents and
the school boards
they have made the decision where that
school is all in person
whether they're all hybrid excuse me all
remote or whether
a combination of the two what's going to
start happening is when you see these
outbreak schools are gonna
you know some some are having to go
remote they don't want to go remote but
they're having to go remote
and as this continues schools are going
to have to start looking at this and
saying okay are we
able to keep our school open or are we
going to have to do something else
we want our schools open we want our
kids playing sports
we we want our kids in drama club we
want them doing plays we want them doing
plain instrument we want to do all these
things
the biggest threat to that is what the
people in the community are doing or not
doing
i don't have i don't know how to say any
more blunt
next question is from carl hunnell at
richlandsource.com
good afternoon governor we are a
in richland county today not to have
become the state's first purple county
on tuesday you said the color-coded
system is meant only to inform
people and is not linked to what the
state may order
but the ohio department of health
website says residents in a purple
county
should quote only leave home for
supplies and services
so governor is this an order from the
state or is it just a suggestion
leaving it up to individual cities and
counties to decide what to do if they
reach level four
thank you uh it is the best advice
that the health experts can give but
it's advice
uh we're not you know we're taught not
tying anything
uh to the colors but they they're there
to inform
uh just as the list that we put up of
the high incident counties they are
there to inform people
and people make their decision
next question is from spencer hickey at
hannah news service
thank you governor negotiations at the
federal level on the next round of aid
packages
broke down earlier in this week and it's
not clear
whether they'll resume before the
election
can ohio sustain the economic and
jobs recovery without any additional
federal
aid well we certainly would like
additional help
you know as we look at the future
you have heard the same things that i've
heard in regard
to when the when the vaccine would be
here
and you know that we will deploy it as
quickly as we can in ohio
but no one thinks that this is going to
be over overnight
uh and so you know we have
we will have continue to have need for
testing uh
and we will continue to have our schools
will continue to have needs
our colleges will continue to have needs
uh and so we would very much
uh you know like a bill to be passed uh
i'm an optimist and uh you know i think
in the lame duck they will pass a bill
we also frankly need guidance so we're
going to be able to
roll some of this money over and try to
plan for the future
which is what we would like to do uh or
is it going to be necessary for all this
money to be spent before
december 31st which would not be frankly
the most prudent thing to do
but we need that language in a bill
uh my understanding from talking to
legislators uh from
talking to members of congress member of
the house the senate uh
is they think if a bill does get passed
that that will contain that uh ability
to to roll that money over but until
it's done
you know we can't be sure that so yeah
we we definitely
uh need need this legislation uh and we
hope that uh
house senate and the president will be
able to reach an agreement
and you know obviously the sooner the
better
next question is from joe ingles at ohio
public radio and television
good afternoon governor um i have a
question
about poll workers and polling places
coming up
um we know that uh from the news out of
michigan today
that there are uh situations up there
and we may have
similar or you know concerning
situations with security in ohio
we also know that we've seen these these
uh
situations where people throw a fit over
wearing a mask and put
employees and businesses and bad
straights and
now with the way that our polling places
uh
with the way things are going to be
conducted there essentially
it relies on the polling places
and the people working in there to be
the police they're the ones who have to
deal with the mask
they're the ones who have to figure out
what constitutes a threat
or violence or or where police should be
called
in light of that wouldn't it make sense
for the state
to get in front of it and make sure that
every polling place
has proper security or do you think that
the security that there
is enough right now
uh this is something that we have talked
about as far as security
uh quite a bit uh we have involved
um the sheriffs we've involved um the
cities
um counties and so there's been a lot of
discussion going on
a lot of exercises being done
um under the law as you know
you know sheriffs play a particular role
uh in in regard to this so
these discussions you know are going to
continue to to go
on and you know we've got a ways to go
before the actual election day itself
but of course
as you know voting is occurring now and
i know that uh you know there are many
counties where
uh you know there's a sheriff's deputy
who is there
uh and i think that's a good idea you
know
again it's it's it is it is
um and uh now when you go to election
day
um you know we'll we'll we'll cross that
bridge when we get to it but uh
i know i know many of the sheriffs are
supplying security at the request of
local
local boards
next question is from scott halas at the
zenia daily gazette
hi governor how are you today scott
the state health department has given
the bengals and the browns
the go-ahead to have around 12 000 fans
or so with their at their home games the
rest of the year
hamilton's red butler's red montgomery
county is red they're all high incidents
all the areas around cleveland are still
orange i mean is this is this a good
idea with the cases
being on the rise especially when you
know alcohol sometimes is involved
people
have a few drinks maybe their judgment
gets cloud clouded
um is this a good idea you know scott no
none of these are none of these are easy
decisions
um what we did with the bengals and the
browns
um we started 6 000 to see how that
would work
as you know you know those those
stadiums hold a lot more than that
it worked seemed to work pretty well
we thought people were safe inside
we looked to see if we it had an uh a
detrimental
impact downtown for people going or
coming
uh i talked to the mayors
talked to the health officials they did
not seem to think that that was
we said okay well let's let's look at
this i decided to go to 12
000 as a
reasonable place uh reasonable in the
sense that
they would still be able to have
tremendous spread out there
and the people would be able to be you
know have a mask on
and would be safe so we think they're
safe inside my frankly my biggest
concern all along has been what happens
going in and going out
that's where my biggest concern has been
what happens downtown
as far as the fans as you know these
fans are drawn
from you know significant areas
um but um you know again keeping the
distance inside
so is there a risk sure there's a risk
in everything that we do i mean but what
we've tried to do
uh and what we believe people can do uh
is live go ahead and live
and um allowing some more people to go
root for the bengals go root for the
browns is something that people
feel very passionately about i think we
think they can do it safely
next question is from sean lanier at
wcmh
in columbus
hey governor just a quick question with
the numbers of covet obviously
still going up and it's widespread
around the state
you talked about meeting with the
restaurant association and talking with
them about
potentially uh just discussing the last
call order is there any concern that
even with what they have to say seeing
what's happening around ohio that
there's just no way
that you'll lift that order and if if
there is a plan
is there any date or any uh data that
you're looking at to indicate when that
should happen
uh no date no plan um
but again all of this is balancing and
as i'm looking at this
um you know we're not going to shut down
this economy again we're not going to
shut everything down
so the question is how do we live with
it in a safest way as we can
and the things that i talked about today
i'm going to say them again you know
people getting together
and not being cautious big groups and
weddings big groups and funerals
people you know doing other activities
where they're not social distancing
where they're not wearing a mask that's
what's causing
the great bulk of this i mean so that's
where
the major part of the problem is
um could it occur at a football game
could it occur at a
high school football game could it occur
at a bar could it
yeah i mean it could occur a lot of
different places
but what we have to do is try to you
know deal with those things
that are the most likely to cause it and
and here again
it's my plea to the people of the state
of ohio you can control this we've done
a great job we're ohioans we're tough
we're strong we can get through this
but we have to social distance and we
have to wear masks
and we have to not go to events with a
lot of people
uh if we do those things our schools can
stay open
if we do those things our kids can play
sports if we do those things
our kids can go to college if we do
those things
people can go uh watch a football game
at a bar
i mean these are all things that we can
do
um and so i again look at
i again look at the mask i can look at
this mask
is our our kind of our uh pathway to
freedom
this enables me to go places this
enables me to see things
this enables me to see a loved one a
grandchild
um you know we want to live
but we're not going the right direction
and if more of us aren't wearing masks
and if more of us
are not being careful
you know we're not going to be able to
do those things because the spread is
just going to be so high
and look there's nobody watching this
today who wants
a family member to get sick let alone
die
uh as a result of this so let's just if
we're all careful
we can live our lives and and we can
have we can we can live
fine and this thing will be over at some
point we'll get through this
but we want everybody at the other end
of it we want them still alive we want
them to make it
and we don't want them to have gotten
sick and have some long
lasting health problem
look i talked to somebody i know the
other day i had not seen this person
for for some time because she had been
sick uh
and i said how you doing i said are you
back to normal 100
i thought she was she said yeah
except i got some long-term damage
so you know that's not everybody but
again
it's something that we all have to think
about so
let's be careful governor next question
is the last question for today and it
belongs to jack windsor at wmfd in
mansfield
jack you get to end it today
lucky you huh governor how about thank
you jack it's my lucky day thank you
thank you for your answer on tuesday
about the high school student forced to
miss her golf tournament
you said that odh was simply following
cdc guidelines however
she would have been outdoors socially
distanced on day
10 of a 14 day quarantine completely
healthy
and the local health department said she
should play
so there's no legal scientific or moral
justification for keeping her from
playing
on tuesday you also announced we're
going to experiment with antigen
tests in schools tests the manufacturer
says it should be used on
only symptomatic people so we're going
to experiment on our kids with tests
that
failed the white house you said the odh
was hesitant to change policy without
data
if kids aren't spreaders or at risk for
severe illness which is what the cdc
said
what other data are we looking for to
stop the unnecessary
unethical masking testing and
quarantining of our kids
and do we owe this young lady an apology
well first of all jack kids are
spreaders
i don't i don't think there's any much
doubt about that as far as what the
evidence is coming out so that's the
problem
uh that's part of the problem uh look am
my
you know this was a a a horrible thing
for her not to be able to play
and it's a horrible thing for other kids
not to be able to do other things
um and there are other stories that i'm
sure that are out there and the other
parents i'm sure who are watching this
we are simply trying to follow the best
medical advice
we could get and so last week
i put our everybody together and i
pulled in people i pulled in people from
the cleveland clinic
from the ohio state university best
people that we could find
and university of cincinnati
and ask them should we change these and
they said we are reluctant to do it
we do not believe we can do this unless
we have some data
and so we are trying to manage a
pandemic
once in a hundred years and
these are tough situations but remember
our goal
throughout this has been to get kids
many kids in school as we could
and we've always felt that the way you
keep kids in school
uh most the kids is you follow these
guidelines
we're going to look at this and as far
as look
no kid is going to the engine test no
they're not dangerous tests they can be
used
uh in this manner and again we're going
to let the experts
ohio state health experts design
you know what kind of model that we're
going to use i will tell you jack we've
already had
a number of schools that have called us
and said we want to be in this we want
to be in this program
so we'll see and we'll we'll report back
on that as we close today i'd like to
play a selection from
the free digital concert that the
cincinnati pops performed
from music hall just this last saturday
the concert was devoted to jazz which is
of course the great american art form
and it was a soundtrack
to the 1920s uh so very appropriate that
we're doing it today
uh the piece we'll hear is by
african-american composer james
reese europe excuse me james reese
europe and it's called
castle house rag i will let cincinnati
pops music director john morris russell
cue this up for us and we'll see you all
next tuesday

those masks
