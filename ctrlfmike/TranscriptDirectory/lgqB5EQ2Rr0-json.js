    "would have been the story i'm sure a lot",
    "of you know it i don't know who the",
    "original author would have been but it",
    "was the story of the girl who wore a",
    "ribbon around her neck",
    "and you re and like you don't know why",
    "she won't take the ribbon off",
    "and that does anyone know this no okay",

    "head falls off",
    "and that just like blew my mind in",
    "kindergarten like i thought that was the",
    "coolest thing and that you could just do",
    "that",
    "in writing so yeah mafia biographies and",
    "then the",
    "i guess they could be related and the uh",
    "the girl with the ribbon excellent great",
    "answers",
    "thank you all for responding so so linda",
    "let's hope you staying frozen here",
    "i know i know and you can you can call",

    "just finished up my mfa at iowa state",
    "university so",
    "um my thesis my body of work that i've",
    "just",
    "i just created for my thesis is i think",
    "the freshest on my mind",
    "um and",
    "um gosh some of the books that i was",
    "reading",
    "um while i was composing that um",
    "that i was trying to emulate um",
    "probably a little bit of ian fraser who",
    "i mentioned before um and his",
    "non-fiction essays just his",
    "inquisitiveness and his um his ability",
    "to just kind of",
    "sit in place and luxuriate in the",

    "um his book um particularly coming to",
    "the country",
    "a lot of nonfiction work um",
    "i think has has been kind of like at the",
    "forefront of my mind um",
    "in the essays that i've been writing",
    "most recently um",
    "yeah i think i don't know",
    "thank you who would like to go next",
    "genie want to try",
    "sure i'll try okay um so i would say",
    "actually the inspiration for my second",
    "book would have been",
    "though it had been around for a while",
    "but the increased attention to the metoo",
    "movement",
    "uh so i was",
    "at the height of the me two movement i",
    "want to say it was like after",
    "the fall it was the month that my first",
    "book came out",
    "and i was getting asked a lot of",
    "questions about this very short scene in",
    "my first book",
    "where sexual assault happens and i just",
    "kind of go past",
    "it and i didn't think anything of it but",
    "so many people at bookstores were asking",
    "me",
    "about it and i got to thinking about why",
    "i hadn't included it in my first book",
    "and that i thought it made",
    "it made things uneven or it was",
    "inconvenient on a craft level",
    "and i'm interested a lot of times in the",
    "stuff that makes writing inconvenient",
    "especially in memoir i like to think of",
    "facts",
    "as formal constraints or facts as well",
    "as i you know know them",
    "and i got to thinking about this sexual",
    "assault and had been",
    "by one of my closest friends growing up",
    "and i thought",
    "i wonder if he still thinks about it so",
    "i reached out to him",
    "and asked him if he would go on the",
    "record and answer my questions",
    "about this um this event that happened",
    "back in",
    "like it would have been 14 years prior",
    "and he agreed because he had felt",
    "guilty all these years and um",
    "and so him saying yes really got me to",
    "investigate larger questions about",
    "like is it possible to be a good person",
    "who commits a terrible act",
    "and what does forgiveness look like and",
    "what does punishment look like and",
    "restorative justice",
    "so i'd say um the increased attention on",
    "the",
    "the metoo movement definitely inspired",
    "me",
    "okay thank you jasmine how about you",
    "yeah so all of my books they tend to",
    "start with a question",
    "that i have about the world or about our",
    "society and",
    "this book in particular started um with",
    "this question of",
    "i was trying to figure out why so many",
    "people",
    "in this country seemed afraid of these",
    "children who are fleeing from a war zone",
    "and then i started to dig deeper into",
    "sort of what it means to be",
    "a muslim american what it means to be an",
    "arab american and this particular",
    "moment um in america and then",
    "kind of branching out from there this",
    "question of how do i write",
    "a book about the universality though of",
    "being 12",
    "about showing um these kids who",
    "probably have very different journey and",
    "lives than",
    "say a child growing up in suburban ohio",
    "at the end of the day",
    "um the interiority of their thoughts and",
    "dreams",
    "um there's a lot of commonalities so i",
    "guess all those questions kind of",
    "um culminated into",
    "wanting to write um other words for home",
    "and sort of wanting to see",
    "a book that i thought was empowering",
    "um in terms of the refugee experience as",
    "opposed to",
    "um being so wrought",
    "um with with trauma which obviously um",
    "there's a lot of difficulties in jude's",
    "journey but there's also",
    "a lot of joy and that was really",
    "important to me",
    "okay who would like to go next i want to",
    "call on you guys so just jump in",
    "um i guess i think",
    "it's kind of interesting being an artist",
    "is that i think a lot of times we joke",
    "about how",
    "we want to kind of sit in the studio in",
    "order to kind of think of our ideas but",
    "all the ideas happen when you turn the",
    "lights off and you",
    "leave the studio and you just go out and",
    "you experience",
    "life you know i'm definitely i mean i",
    "think about",
    "introvert or extra i definitely am on",
    "the extroverted kind of side",
    "and i love talking to people and i love",
    "interacting with people and connecting",
    "with people",
    "and i find more people i connect with",
    "and interact with i",
    "i they'll just be ideas that will come",
    "to mind i'll run into a little girl and",
    "i'll be really fascinated by her",
    "really cool pattern leggings and",
    "suddenly a little girl with patterned",
    "leggings shows up in my books like i'll",
    "have a",
    "conversation with my sister and i'll be",
    "like oh then that should be kind of",
    "added in there",
    "i think what's just really cool about",
    "being an artist is just",
    "staying open to those kind of moments of",
    "inspiration where it hits you every",
    "single day",
    "great thanks next",
    "okay um well it's it's easy for me to",
    "to say because my my latest book was",
    "about the spring migration here in",
    "northwestern ohio and after",
    "living through it year after year um",
    "you get these days in in late april when",
    "it seems like things have been stuck for",
    "a while and",
    "you know the trees aren't really leafing",
    "out and the birds haven't really arrived",
    "and you're waiting and looking at the",
    "weather patterns",
    "day after day and then there's this",
    "glorious day when everything comes",
    "piling in",
    "their south winds overnight and you go",
    "out in the morning and there are all",
    "these little birds all over the trees",
    "these",
    "colorful warblers that just spent the",
    "winter in south america and it's like",
    "you know it's like resurrection it's",
    "like you've been born again and here's",
    "all this variety and abundance of life",
    "and",
    "you know i i didn't really start writing",
    "the book until i reached the point where",
    "there was no way i could stop myself",
    "from writing it it was just",
    "it was something i had to do it seems",
    "like the time because you've helped us",
    "so many times at ohio magazine with",
    "quite wildlife questions we have but",
    "this seemed like a time theater it's",
    "just something a little different",
    "for you isn't it it's more of a personal",
    "journey yeah",
    "it was just sort of the i was trying to",
    "describe the science but",
    "more so describe the magic of it and",
    "just the emotional response",
    "thank you next yeah um",
    "i i sympathize a lot with what jasmine",
    "said about starting with a question",
    "um i had um uh",
    "and also what olga said about about",
    "about the idea coming the moment you",
    "stop writing you know you",
    "you you have the perfect place to work",
    "and then it comes to you",
    "the moment you close the door but um i",
    "was i was in um",
    "i was staying in latvia for a while and",
    "um and then",
    "was visiting um my german publisher in",
    "hamburg on the way back i had um",
    "about six or seven euros left in my",
    "pocket i was going back to latvia",
    "and latvia was not on the euro at the",
    "time i",
    "just hate having money that i can't",
    "spend you know",
    "so i i got in line to get into my flight",
    "and there was a",
    "um i was just gonna ask the guy at",
    "the desk how much it cost to buy martini",
    "on this plane because i thought that",
    "would be the perfect way of",
    "blowing my last euros but it would be so",
    "infuriating if the martini cost eight",
    "euros",
    "and i'd be stuck with this money so um",
    "and i had nothing else to do",
    "so meantime as i was waiting there was a",
    "child in front of me",
    "who uh in two or two he was about four",
    "or five years old",
    "and he was crying in this really",
    "controlled but",
    "clearly really terrified way and the",
    "flight attendant and uh",
    "and his mother were trying were sort of",
    "bent down trying to calm him down",
    "and then the woman i took to be his",
    "mother went and sat in the seats",
    "and talked to somebody else and i",
    "realized she wasn't the mother at all",
    "she was just trying to help",
    "then the woman from the airline took the",
    "kid away",
    "he's crying continually the whole time",
    "10 or 15 minutes it takes about 10 to 15",
    "more minutes for me to get to the front",
    "of the line",
    "and i asked the guy at the desk how much",
    "does it cost by a martini in this plane",
    "and he said i don't know i said",
    "you have no idea he said i don't work",
    "for this airline this is a this is a",
    "latvian airline",
    "they have one flight into this airport i",
    "work for the airport",
    "and i said oh damn what was the matter",
    "with that kid",
    "and just as he said that the woman who",
    "had taken the kid away",
    "brought him back around the corner and",
    "he was crying just the same way",
    "for half an hour he was crying the",
    "entire time",
    "and he said nobody can figure out what",
    "language he's speaking",
    "oh wow he was he it",
    "as it turned out over over time over the",
    "next half hour so",
    "it became pretty obvious that someone",
    "had left him there",
    "on purpose and i i other people did the",
    "best thing that we could we were like",
    "sort of pelting him with different",
    "languages",
    "trying to figure out that someone think",
    "was sure that he was estonian",
    "but whatever language he started",
    "speaking at the beginning was very",
    "obscure nobody understood it and then he",
    "just stopped talking all together",
    "so eventually i followed them down to",
    "the end of the secure area of the",
    "airport",
    "and she took him through the door",
    "the door closed and i never saw him",
    "again",
    "um when i finally got on the plane it",
    "was every everybody was",
    "i mean for an hour on the flight every",
    "everybody had seen this happen",
    "in the whole room the whole airplane",
    "was full of people who were just sick",
    "with",
    "terror like on on behalf of this child",
    "and none of us could ever as far as i",
    "know ever find out",
    "so my book is uh it was about 10 years",
    "of writing the book was",
    "how did that boy get there um and so it",
    "goes back to vietnam",
    "uh my answer is that he's the he's",
    "goes to his father his father's left him",
    "there and his",
    "father is a vietnam veteran who's who",
    "becomes the main character of the book",
    "the volunteer",
    "right so just with you jasmine about",
    "like having a question and if you you",
    "know the writer really wants to know",
    "something that's",
    "that's the fuel that makes the book go",
    "wow",
    "thank you for sharing that anyone else",
    "i think it was all of us on there all of",
    "you okay",
    "okay can you talk about what the is what",
    "the writing process is like for each of",
    "you",
    "you can just jump in",
    "and we'll start with brendan again i",
    "shouldn't do call on you but",
    "why don't you lead us off and then just",
    "jump in no problem",
    "um yeah i'm i'm kind of",
    "in a transitional phase with my writing",
    "um",
    "you know just leaving um school",
    "where i was working really closely with",
    "professors and with",
    "colleagues in the mfa program um you",
    "know where i was i was in kind of this",
    "structured environment where",
    "i was um completing assignments um",
    "that were you know mandated in either",
    "length or topic",
    "or subject and so",
    "i'm kind of wondering that same question",
    "for myself right now",
    "is what does the creative process look",
    "for me now now that i'm",
    "kind of writing independently um and not",
    "in a system anymore um",
    "and i think that um just curiosity is",
    "really fundamental to that",
    "um that's what that's that's kind of the",
    "seed",
    "that every essay and every short story",
    "and every um",
    "piece of writing kind of blooms out of",
    "um",
    "is what what piques your interest and",
    "what um",
    "what kind of ideas are willing to chase",
    "one of my",
    "one of my professors at hiram college",
    "mary quaid who",
    "has been really influential",
    "in my writing career once in class",
    "said the hardest thing for a young",
    "writer is knowing",
    "um is knowing when your wild hair is a",
    "good wild hair and that you should chase",
    "it",
    "and so i think that that's the start of",
    "the creative process for everyone is",
    "is seeing that wild hair so to speak",
    "and deciding to chase it um and",
    "following it down it's rabbit hole",
    "if that's where it leads um",
    "and so that's that's i think probably my",
    "favorite metaphor for the creative",
    "process is that",
    "um you just get into the weeds um",
    "and start searching around until you",
    "find um",
    "you start everything starts to make",
    "sense and coalesce around the project",
    "that you're working on",
    "beyond that like i said it's",
    "being independently accountable to",
    "myself now is i'm still laying the",
    "framework for that",
    "in terms of actually producing producing",
    "work um",
    "but um i think that it's",
    "it's just like a lifelong learning and",
    "growing process",
    "okay anybody want to jump in next uh",
    "maybe i'll jump in",
    "okay um i",
    "i i will be honest um",
    "writing for me is so stressful i like",
    "finishing it rather than the actual",
    "process of doing it",
    "it stresses me out um i wish i could say",
    "more romantic things about that process",
    "but",
    "you're a kindred soul dorothy parker",
    "once said i hate to write i love to have",
    "written",
    "and that's pretty i can understand that",
    "is really well i think the thing that",
    "helps me the most and i do this the same",
    "way whenever i'm",
    "drawing whenever i like i don't really",
    "know what idea i'm trying to do",
    "i just sketch a bunch and i do a lot of",
    "really fast sketches and i just keep",
    "going and going and going and going",
    "and i like just doing producing a lot",
    "because i find when you start to produce",
    "a lot of stories or at least a lot of",
    "drawings",
    "you get less precious about things you",
    "let you overthink less and you just kind",
    "of try to put",
    "ideas down and so a lot of the stuff",
    "that you'll put down",
    "is isn't really much of anything but",
    "then at least you can kind of go back",
    "and look and you're like oh no",
    "something's here",
    "something's there and then you draw some",
    "more and you draw some more and draw",
    "some more",
    "and so usually because i find writing so",
    "stressful that",
    "is my approach to writing and so before",
    "i did",
    "saturday i think i had just i would just",
    "do",
    "multiple children's book stories a week",
    "and just do as many as i could",
    "and then kind of and the interesting",
    "thing that kind of happened",
    "was all the stories that i had written i",
    "kind of just like",
    "threw away but i was glad that i wrote",
    "them because i started to see",
    "things that i was doing like i think the",
    "big things particularly in picture books",
    "when you're writing for children",
    "is not to try to lecture children or",
    "get too involved in whatever message or",
    "thing you have on your heart",
    "but really think about what's going to",
    "make a kid smile what",
    "that's really going to entertain them",
    "and so i think",
    "the more and more you write and you just",
    "kind of produce a lot",
    "you just get freer you get less in your",
    "head",
    "and you kind of enter into more of like",
    "a child-like mindset",
    "and create a story so that's what i hope",
    "always happens thank you it has yes",
    "it makes me that reminds me of a great",
    "moment in the annie dillard book the",
    "writing life i don't know if you've ever",
    "read",
    "that but she has a similar advice",
    "as what is what you were saying that um",
    "you you can't save anything",
    "you have to spend everything all of it",
    "right now",
    "the moment you the moment the idea comes",
    "to you",
    "she's the great line is like the impulse",
    "to save",
    "an interesting thing for later",
    "should be the cue to spend it now",
    "because if everything that you save when",
    "you go back to it",
    "it's it's gone to ash right i have",
    "actually never",
    "written i've never read that book but um",
    "a fellow illustrator of mine sophie",
    "mccall uh",
    "loves that quote and so it's actually on",
    "my wall no no kidding",
    "like oh it's right there",
    "[Laughter]",
    "so i would definitely agree with that",
    "great",
    "that's great how about you ken",
    "yeah well i i still haven't developed an",
    "actual process for writing",
    "um i know i'll have to do that",
    "eventually",
    "the one thing i can say is that i've",
    "never written anything where i started",
    "at the beginning",
    "and wrote through to the end i always",
    "start like somewhere in the middle and",
    "put pieces together",
    "and i i probably should have an outline",
    "but i don't do an outline until i've got",
    "most of it and then i sort of go back",
    "and and do it after the fact",
    "outline what i've got because you know",
    "if you're going to send off a proposal",
    "to an agent or publisher",
    "you need to have like the outline of it",
    "but it it happens later so",
    "um ideas just come to me and i'll",
    "scribble things down on index cards",
    "while i'm out walking around in the",
    "woods or something and gradually all the",
    "pieces come together so",
    "all i can say is that if anyone really",
    "wants to be a writer they shouldn't",
    "follow my example",
    "genie how about you i feel like so much",
    "of the process",
    "when i'm when i'm stuck it's like",
    "looking into the refrigerator",
    "just thinking maybe the answers just",
    "staring right or staring at the wall",
    "um i just think so much of pro the",
    "writing process is thinking",
    "uh and i don't know with like both of my",
    "books the process was very different",
    "where the first one it was very much in",
    "collage",
    "mode and i think that's because it",
    "started as poetry shifted to fiction",
    "went to non-fiction i was trying out",
    "different genres in different forms",
    "and where i would i like to print my",
    "manuscript single-sided well you can see",
    "on my my binders i use those for",
    "different projects",
    "um i like to print things single-sided",
    "and then",
    "you know put them in a binder but cut",
    "them apart and rearrange and sometimes",
    "look for artful juxtapositions",
    "or cut a paragraph up and look for",
    "opportunities to deepen",
    "um but then the second book wasn't very",
    "collaging it was more",
    "um it was more methodical and",
    "moving i thought i was writing slowly",
    "where i was going",
    "sentence by sentence which was very",
    "unusual for me but it actually",
    "not to say we should value speed it",
    "seems like such an american thing of",
    "like productivity",
    "but it it did go a lot more quickly for",
    "me because i was",
    "i wrote a sentence and i would think",
    "okay looking back like what comes next",
    "and sounds so basic",
    "but it really helped me see it through",
    "and but i think like the pr it changes",
    "project to project it depends what the",
    "demands are what the questions are",
    "and i i think um it's at the start of",
    "the project and the very",
    "end of one when i need the most",
    "discipline you know and it's like okay",
    "get up at 4am or 5am and",
    "don't check the news don't you know just",
    "just start writing",
    "uh but when i'm in the middle of a",
    "project that's the best part",
    "because you're forming connections",
    "constantly suddenly everything",
    "becomes potential material uh",
    "or potential answers to a problem that",
    "you're facing so",
    "um so yeah i think it just it just",
    "depends on",
    "i feel like each time like now i'm back",
    "in that period that's why the award is",
    "so nice it gives you a renewed sense of",
    "confidence",
    "but like after each time i finish",
    "something i'm like i'll never write",
    "again i forget how to write",
    "how did i do that um and it's just",
    "it's also a lot of patience i think",
    "that's another huge part of the process",
    "is being patient with yourself",
    "okay and jasmine",
    "yeah i agree with what everyone has",
    "already said i think it's very similar",
    "for me i'm sort of a",
    "i guess every book i would say has a",
    "different process",
    "because i have to learn how to write",
    "that particular book",
    "but on the fundamentals that i think",
    "kind of",
    "glued together for me or that i'm a",
    "fumbler and a collector and that i never",
    "quite know what the book is that i'm",
    "setting out to write and so i sort of",
    "fumble through it",
    "um but sort of like um okay you",
    "mentioned that there's",
    "a quality of fun to that and i try um to",
    "keep that sort of quality of play and",
    "fun because that's one of the things",
    "that i love about writing is the",
    "messiness of it and that i don't know",
    "even though it's also the part that",
    "makes me",
    "feel um very frustrated often so i think",
    "that",
    "so much of my writing process is letting",
    "ideas marinate so",
    "the characters and the voice and the",
    "storyline live with me for a long time",
    "and i'm",
    "thinking about them when i'm driving",
    "around or when i'm going to the grocery",
    "store and then",
    "slowly um i start to build those",
    "connections but it's definitely",
    "um like a messy long process that i",
    "think is easy to romanticize",
    "uh once i finished a book to look back",
    "and see all the",
    "moments that i enjoyed when things",
    "clicked and sort of",
    "uh forget about all the moments that i",
    "wanted to give up on the book and um so",
    "i think that that's what i have to",
    "remind myself",
    "of every time that i start again that um",
    "that it wasn't always like just fun and",
    "joy with",
    "the book that uh was completed it would",
    "be painful yes if anyone wants to ask",
    "questions you know please type them in",
    "the chat",
    "room there hit chat and do it and we'll",
    "answer them",
    "what did you learn about what did you",
    "learn while writing",
    "this book talk about that process did",
    "you learn anything anybody i'm not going",
    "to call it this time i'm not going gonna",
    "call it because that's kind of a tough",
    "question",
    "anyway jump in",
    "nobody's gonna jump in i'm gonna have to",
    "call on people brandon",
    "a lot of german adoption law um",
    "very strange and the wonders will",
    "translate",
    "you could take happily i mean i had to",
    "figure out",
    "what exactly if a child is going into an",
    "orphanage",
    "what what what are the rules that govern",
    "how the child gets out of the orphanage",
    "and it being germany of course",
    "there are rules and they're written down",
    "and",
    "i couldn't read german but but google",
    "translate could like turn",
    "an entire book into something",
    "approximating",
    "english and that and a hundred thousand",
    "other things i learned a lot about",
    "how what was there where did the",
    "research take you because that must have",
    "been tough",
    "your research where did that take you to",
    "write this how did you did you do a lot",
    "of research on the book",
    "oh absolutely yeah i mean i i",
    "in a hundred thousand places i mean i",
    "talked to my dad a lot about um",
    "the part a good part of the book takes",
    "place at the siege of caisson",
    "and um uh and uh this amazing moment",
    "when um uh for him that he you know he",
    "thought",
    "he he just figured he was going to die",
    "there because",
    "he was um he was a marine",
    "um uh basically hiding out um",
    "for most of the time and didn't have any",
    "idea the larger significance of",
    "anything that was going on and they came",
    "home and had a second tour of duty",
    "then came home to stay and then seven or",
    "eight years later he was",
    "watching a video he was watching a",
    "documentary on tv",
    "and found out that it had been the",
    "largest caisson had been",
    "the largest aerial bombardment in the",
    "history of warfare",
    "i mean he was he was in the middle of",
    "history",
    "and only knew the tiniest little part",
    "that was",
    "immediately surrounding him he was an",
    "enlisted man which was",
    "why he was like i mean he was a just",
    "selfishly as a fiction writer",
    "exactly the kind of source that you want",
    "for a novel because",
    "everything that he remembered he",
    "remembered because it was real",
    "not because it conformed with the larger",
    "history that we would",
    "you know not because historians would",
    "later say that it was important",
    "and it's those things that like i forget",
    "who who coined this term but",
    "while often what you're looking for is a",
    "significant irrelevance",
    "you know something that's something that",
    "that it it",
    "details chekhov is very good at this",
    "like it's so",
    "irresponsible to everything else that's",
    "going on in the story that you believe",
    "it absolutely and it becomes",
    "the source of reality",
    "thank you ken how about you",
    "um yeah most of the books i've written",
    "have been reference books",
    "but the i mean the the latest one the",
    "season on the wind has got",
    "there is a lot of information and every",
    "time i start in to write a book like",
    "that",
    "i sort of assume that i know the subject",
    "really thoroughly but once you get into",
    "it",
    "you have to put it down in black and",
    "white i started thinking well",
    "you know so even though i'd read",
    "you know dozens of books and thousands",
    "of scientific papers about bird",
    "migration before",
    "i had to go in and reread or read all",
    "the latest information because",
    "you know there's new research being done",
    "and new stuff coming out",
    "and i had to learn a lot more about the",
    "local geography in northwestern ohio",
    "because i didn't know it as well as i",
    "thought i did so",
    "it's it's always a learning project and",
    "you know i feel like i know the subject",
    "completely",
    "until i start to write it down",
    "ms moore how about you",
    "what any things you learned while",
    "writing the book",
    "did i pronounce your name wrong",
    "yeah you're mute you're on mute oh",
    "you're talking you said maura so i was",
    "like",
    "how do you pronounce your name i should",
    "i should have paid attention well my",
    "name's ogay",
    "okay okay and your last name your last",
    "name",
    "okay okay how about you what did you",
    "learn about when writing this book what",
    "did you learn about",
    "um well i don't know if i've learned",
    "much when writing it",
    "but i think the really cool thing about",
    "um",
    "making artwork is you know part of the",
    "the need to make artwork or make",
    "collages is that you",
    "you don't actually have the words for",
    "what you're trying to convey",
    "and you just kind of know you don't know",
    "you don't know how to express it",
    "like uh to someone but you you know how",
    "it feels and so you",
    "that's what you kind of like weave into",
    "all of your work",
    "and so it's kind of nice particularly",
    "when i think about my artwork is",
    "looking back at it and looking back at",
    "it over time",
    "and discovering new things within my",
    "work and understanding more and",
    "learning to kind of find the language",
    "for what when i made it i didn't really",
    "have the language for it yet",
    "that's going to be challenging to find",
    "the language to take words and really",
    "translate them into pictures",
    "is that a challenge um i think i",
    "i guess i don't really think of it as",
    "like translating",
    "um words into pictures it's kind of",
    "it's it's like like they're both like",
    "you're you're kind of going back and",
    "forth okay you know",
    "um like i know a lot of author and",
    "illustrators who actually like",
    "make illustrations before they like",
    "write everything or some people kind of",
    "go back and forth",
    "the most part i like write before i",
    "illustrate",
    "but there's like a lot of like the",
    "illustrations or things that you'll see",
    "in my sketchbook",
    "i was already kind of playing around",
    "with particular things that were just",
    "kind of stuck",
    "particularly in my mind something that",
    "was kind of interesting about book",
    "like saturday is so much of saturday has",
    "a musicality to",
    "it and a lot of the characters positions",
    "it kind of looks like they're dancing",
    "from page to page",
    "and i didn't plan this from",
    "the beginning but that's the fun of",
    "making artwork is",
    "finding the surprises later on um",
    "but i use a lot of old song books in the",
    "collages",
    "okay it was kind of interesting kind of",
    "looking back",
    "and seeing all the different ways that",
    "i'm kind of creating a language within",
    "the book",
    "how did you use different materials for",
    "your collages uh yeah so yeah tell me",
    "how you choose the materials and and",
    "what you use you saw song books or one",
    "what are some of the other favorite song",
    "books newspapers",
    "uh birthday cards paper i make myself",
    "things i paint over",
    "sometimes i'll like cut out pieces of",
    "paper",
    "and i'll start kind of layering them on",
    "top of each other and paint some more on",
    "it and just use different kind of tools",
    "and things like that",
    "one of the things i love particularly",
    "about collage is that it's just anything",
    "goes",
    "um i think uh i was hilarious i was",
    "talking to my",
    "agent i think some weeks back and he",
    "always kind of sends out cookies and",
    "things like that and they come with like",
    "this like little craft note",
    "um and i just love this craft paper that",
    "it comes with because most craft paper",
    "this is like a weird artist thing but",
    "like",
    "most craft paper has a very warm tone",
    "most craft papers you see",
    "but this craft paper has a slightly",
    "cooler tone than most craft papers",
    "and so like i really appreciated the",
    "cookies and like the nice kind of",
    "heartfelt note",
    "but that definitely went into my paper",
    "drawers and ended up flying into one of",
    "my books and so",
    "from like my my family and the people i",
    "know know me very well where",
    "i might be like oh thank you and unwrap",
    "my gift and then like",
    "keep the wrapping paper you know",
    "it sounds like many times that's great",
    "when i was still going to schools like",
    "kids will like hear about like my paper",
    "process and so sometimes",
    "my gifts are um someone gave me like",
    "some green paper from some cake shop",
    "that like",
    "had a little frosting on it but i ended",
    "up using the paper but",
    "i get lots of paper on i used to get",
    "lots of paper on my travels as well",
    "which is great that's great when people",
    "see",
    "somebody sending you paper that's great",
    "people have it's kind of great",
    "genie how about you what did you learn",
    "while writing this book",
    "gosh so much so much because i think it",
    "um it goes back to jasmine had mentioned",
    "you know starting with a question i",
    "think so many questions were informing",
    "my exploration um certainly it was",
    "fascinating to me that",
    "the changing definitions of sexual",
    "assault",
    "and rape and how that really",
    "shapes one's understanding of what",
    "happened to oneself that was really",
    "interesting and to see how it differs",
    "state by state and then after the book",
    "came out certainly talking",
    "with readers about that and for them to",
    "like",
    "read a definition and realize oh what i",
    "experienced",
    "was rape you know like not having",
    "necessarily the language for it um and",
    "it seems like such an obviously",
    "neanderthal thing like of course",
    "language shapes our thinking but it was",
    "really interesting to read about",
    "um to read about the history of the law",
    "and like what",
    "shaped these motivations behind certain",
    "definitions but then something else was",
    "um i never quote like i understood it",
    "conceptually but this idea of gender",
    "performance or the performance of gender",
    "and i you know when i started my project",
    "and i was going to reach out i",
    "reached out to this former friend i",
    "thought okay i'm going to be very tough",
    "on him i'm going to ask him",
    "you know really hard questions and i i",
    "have a list in the book of questions i",
    "thought i was going to ask him and then",
    "as soon as i heard his voice i recorded",
    "all of these",
    "um conversations as soon as i heard his",
    "voice i slipped",
    "back into like our friendship i mean we",
    "had been friends for almost five years",
    "and so",
    "i i immediately became accommodating and",
    "wanting to make him comfortable",
    "and saying oh no no no i'm okay like",
    "enough time has passed",
    "uh and like listening back to it was a",
    "little more defined because i knew to an",
    "extent certainly i",
    "that i did this but i just didn't",
    "realize to what extent so that was",
    "something interesting that i",
    "learned about myself um but uh so much",
    "of the book became about female",
    "friendships like a lot of my",
    "friends read the transcripts of the",
    "conversations my interviews with him and",
    "you know they were um they found it so",
    "obnoxious like his",
    "uh his answers and then i would make",
    "excuses",
    "for him uh and so that it was just",
    "the self-awareness that came through in",
    "writing the project i think",
    "was really meaningful not that i write",
    "for catharsis or",
    "and it's not that but um",
    "but i think the history of rape law and",
    "then just listening to those interviews",
    "and transcribing them and really",
    "witnessing myself",
    "performing like doing gender performance",
    "where it doesn't feel like a performance",
    "right it feels very genuine",
    "but these are learned behaviors so say",
    "those were two of the big things i",
    "learned",
    "okay and jasmine how about you what did",
    "you learn while writing this",
    "yearbook i guess maybe on like a",
    "philosophical level which i can only",
    "now see after having written the book",
    "but",
    "this idea of writing into what you're",
    "afraid of",
    "in some ways and things that make you",
    "uncomfortable and",
    "in doing that you can find this like",
    "patch of light to work within and i",
    "think that",
    "um when i first started this book i was",
    "um coming up against a lot of walls",
    "because i didn't want to go to these",
    "places that",
    "made me uncomfortable or made me upset",
    "and realizing that",
    "through writing into that i would be",
    "able to kind of get to the light",
    "on the other side and then uh the main",
    "character",
    "jude is confident in a way that i wasn't",
    "as a young person",
    "and i think that in writing her",
    "confidence",
    "and this sort of",
    "bravery it sort of made me braver to be",
    "able to",
    "go out and talk about this book um",
    "in ways that used to make me really",
    "uncomfortable to talk",
    "um about and so i think that i kind of",
    "learned",
    "um through writing that um",
    "yeah so i don't know and just a",
    "a big part of writing for kids is",
    "getting to see",
    "how children react to the book and",
    "absorb the book",
    "and before the world shut down i was",
    "getting to do a lot of school visits and",
    "i think that",
    "through writing this book i've learned",
    "again it's reconfirmed so much for what",
    "i thought about the young reader but",
    "that you can trust them and they make",
    "these connections and",
    "they've taught me things about the book",
    "that i didn't realize so i guess i",
    "learned",
    "um from that from writing but that's",
    "been like an incredible gift to see",
    "the book again um kind of through uh the",
    "way that they experienced it",
    "okay one one final question i have and",
    "anybody can jump in if if you know",
    "what's next for you what will your next",
    "project be",
    "anybody want to share that well",
    "i have a new book coming out in may um",
    "it's another middle grade novel",
    "it's called the shape of thunder um and",
    "it is about two young girls who",
    "um it takes place um",
    "a year after a school shooting has",
    "happened at the high school in their",
    "small ohio town they're both middle",
    "schoolers",
    "um but the book explores the way um",
    "they've both been affected by this",
    "tragedy they're kind of on opposite",
    "sides of the tragedy and their",
    "friendship has uh",
    "been fractured by it so i talked a",
    "little bit",
    "i guess at the beginning when we were",
    "asked about like favorite books when we",
    "were young",
    "about the bridge to terabitha and this",
    "book in some ways is like my homage to",
    "that book it's a book about",
    "two um kids who are",
    "kind of finding a place where they can",
    "feel safe",
    "and kind of feels like magic when the",
    "rest of the world",
    "feels unseen anybody else want to",
    "mention what's next",
    "in their world with books um i've",
    "had success in projects in the past of",
    "um",
    "not necessarily knowing what the end",
    "project or product was going to look",
    "like or the connections that i was going",
    "to find once i started exploring a topic",
    "but",
    "um i",
    "i went up to alberta a few years ago to",
    "work",
    "with some ecologists who were studying",
    "this short grass fescue prairie",
    "in southern alberta and at the time i",
    "was really",
    "obsessed with this idea of",
    "points of inaccessibility which are the",
    "points on a body of the point on a body",
    "of land",
    "which is um the furthest point you can",
    "get from any",
    "shoreline um and the",
    "point of inaccessibility in north",
    "america is in south dakota and my plan",
    "was to",
    "visit this this i tried to find this",
    "spot",
    "on my way up to alberta or my way back",
    "um and i was just",
    "kind of consumed with this idea of",
    "standing",
    "on the heart of the continent um",
    "but the more time i spent up in alberta",
    "with these ecologists and these",
    "scientists who are studying",
    "this really complex ecosystem the more i",
    "realize that the identity and the heart",
    "of a of a geographic place is",
    "much more abstract and takes into",
    "consideration a lot more things than",
    "just",
    "um the physical location um and so that",
    "was an example of a project that really",
    "like just kind of unfolded around me as",
    "i was within it",
    "um and right now i'm",
    "really interested in um",
    "barn owls which are an endangered",
    "species in iowa um",
    "and i'm not really sure",
    "where the barn owls are going to take me",
    "but um i think",
    "just kind of jumping with both feet has",
    "worked out well in the past and so",
    "i've i've got these kinds of ideas of",
    "knocking together some nesting boxes and",
    "um just seeing what happens once the",
    "barn owls come to visit",
    "okay anybody else want to share what's",
    "next",
    "no um yeah sure okay as",
    "as we speak as like i turn around like",
    "i'm here in my studio in rhode island",
    "but i'm working on my",
    "my next book it's not a book i wrote but",
    "it's a book i'm illustrating called",
    "everybody in the red brick building",
    "we're supposed to come in 2021",
    "and it's this really fabulous little",
    "bedtime story",
    "about this red brick building that's all",
    "quiet and everything's wonderful",
    "and then the baby wakes up the baby",
