so
good afternoon everyone
well today is constitution day i've got
a
flag high on here instead of the usual
university college tie that i were
you may see also the the two helmets
uh tonight's gonna be a fun game and
bengals will be playing at the browns
and
national tv thursday night football
so we're excited about that
i want to introduce my wife fran who
really has i think some exciting
news about a new partnership friend
earlier this week the ohio governor's
imagination library
and cosi announced a partnership that
will help kids in need
connect reading with hands-on science
cosi is traveling the state to provide
learning lunch boxes to children
these lunch these learning lunch boxes
include lunch
a stem kit with fun experiments
in an enrollment form forum for the ohio
governor's imagination library
i want to show you one of these great
kits
this is actually one that they did with
uh that they partnered with the
department of agriculture to make this
and it's about
water quality and there's a lot of
experiments in here to do
and it's just lots of fun things
so they've partnered with the columbus
library
and they do lunch the lunch is actually
furnished
by the hunger alliance and the kids can
check out books as well
yesterday kosai was actually in athens
ohio
and it was the local food bank that was
sponsoring a
food giveaway and so the kids also got
the uh
little stem boxes so um
i think they're finding lots of fun ways
to to do this
and getting food to the kids as well and
next week they'll actually be in cantons
so they'll be giving away
some boxes there too but it's important
for children to continue learning during
these challenging
times and partnerships like these help
to bring creative
solutions to ohio families so
we're really excited cosi also recently
launched a digital story time
on their co-side connects platform and
to celebrate the launch of the
partnership
i got to read one of the ohio
imagination library books
as an oak tree grows
so this is kind of a cool book that some
of the kids are getting this year
and after i read the book dr burtley
from coaside did a fun experiment to
learn about how trees grow
so cosi
if you want to find out more about this
visit the cosi
dot www.cosig.org connects to see this
video and a lot of the fun experiments
that you can do
right at home thanks
good friend well today is constitution
day
on september 17 1787
uh country's founders signed the new
united states
constitution um it really was a miracle
there's a book i read a number of years
ago
it's called miracle at philadelphia
and what they gave us has endured
and thrived throughout throughout the
years it's really provided a roadmap for
roadmap for americans and freedom-loving
people really
all over the world
the words of preamble we the people of
the united states in order to form a
more perfect union
establish justice ensure domestic
tranquility
provide for the economic for the common
defense promote the general welfare and
secure the blessings of liberty to
ourselves and our
posterity to ordain establish this
constitution
of the united states of america and that
is the the preamble
and i i wanted to uh give a shout out
to all the social studies teachers out
there uh
in high school and uh grade school and
uh
and junior high thank you for what
you're doing uh when
fran i got married uh i thought i was
going to be a social studies teacher it
didn't work out but uh my admiration for
all of you and what you do every day is
a
is is very great uh because teaching the
next generation about our constitution
next generation about our country uh is
so very
very very important when i was a member
of the united states senate in 2003
and this is real participatory democracy
a group of students from lynchburg clay
high school in highland county wrote to
ask why we didn't have a holiday to mark
constitution day
so i introduced drafted a resolution
ultimately senator byrd from west
virginia was able to get this passed
and to mark september 7th officially as
constitution day and provided that
all schools should teach about our
constitution
some good news from the ohio department
of natural resources
uh director mary mertz this morning the
ohio department of natural resources
division of wildlife shared their
preliminary results from surveys in the
western basin of lake erie measuring
walleye
and yellow perch hatches a survey found
that both walleye and yellow perch
hatches are
above average continuing an exceptional
era
of fish production in lake erie
this year's survey sample was
outstanding for this part of lake erie
and is following the trend of
the projected historic high for walleye
population in the western basin
in 2021 good news for those who love to
fish
and on a personal note i think fran and
i
finished up maybe the last of our
lake lake erie uh walleye and perch
uh not too long ago eric let's go to the
data
take a look data slides
we continue as you can see to kind of
hover around a thousand it goes down on
the weekends but continues to go back up
we just can't seem to get the number of
new cases down
significantly fairly flat in regard to
that tragically
25 deaths have been reported to us in
the last
24 hours hospitalizations which is very
similar to the
uh 21 day average
icu admissions is up over the over the
over that average
uh okay eric let's take a look at the
next one
this is last week's
uh alert this is this week's
and uh we'll talk a little bit about
this uh
69 counties stayed the same i mean
really what you're seeing is just kind
of the spread of the virus over
over the state 69 counties stayed at the
same level two counties prevalent summit
dropped from
red to orange so congratulations to
preble and summit
we are seeing a shift throughout the
state
though 11 counties moved from yellow to
orange
this week and the number of counties
seeing significant increases in cases
and exceeding the cdc's
threshold for high incidence remember
that that is
based upon a two-week period of time per
100 per hundred thousand
that number of high incident counties
has grown from 17 to 21.
70 percent of ohioans are now living in
an orange county
we have five red counties this week the
lowest number of red counties we've
reported since starting the alert
system so good news
in regard to that lowering of the red
counties but the high incident counties
we're seeing a number of those as i said
red counties this week are butler mercer
montgomery portage and
putnam let's talk about what we're
seeing in our red counties we'll talk at
will go in the order of or they are the
highest uh
number of cases per 100 000 uh putnam
county
uh it would be number one uh 256 cases
per hundred thousand
uh in the past two weeks they continue
red for the
third week because the county meets that
cdc's
threshold for high incidence which is a
hundred so they're well over that
they're two and a half times that
your average daily emergency department
visits grew from one
on august 26 to
an average of three and a half on
september 4. in august more than 40
of their cases were with people between
50 and 69 local health department
officials attribute high case numbers to
several larger
social gatherings including multiple
many weddings
they also said there's spread in
households from one family
to another one member excuse me one
member to another
mercer county would be the second one of
the red counties
there are 240 cases per hundred thousand
that's the seventh consecutive week for
mercer county
they've had 99 new cases actual cases
during the past
two weeks in a press release yesterday
from the mercer county public health
department they said that the county had
19
new cases reported during the preceding
day
so that is very very concerning mercer
county health department reports that
the growth in cases
is not attributable really to nursing
home but rather it
the spread continues throughout the
county
uh butler county they are at 182 cases
per hundred thousand
um they remain red because they meet the
high
incidence threshold uh which we said was
is a hundred
miami university continues to impact
case numbers even though the cases on
campus are dropping
i talked this morning uh to randy thomas
uh
at miami uh randy went through the
figures with me and what we're seeing is
frankly a real
decrease uh in in some of these numbers
uh so we're happy about that
but what we're seeing at miami is what
we're seeing at other universities
off-campus activities
off-campus activities not what's going
on
so much on campus but off campus
continue to impact the county's number
of cases
[Music]
montgomery county they they are at 139
cases per hundred thousand uh they've
been declining during the past few weeks
which is good with cases per capita
declining from 178 to 139.
montgomery county is the only county to
trigger the covet hospitalization
indicator
their hospitalizations went from an
average of four per day on august 31st
to an average of seven per day
on september 13th uh
cases with the university of dayton have
also stabilized as they have at
miami so we're happy to hear that
let's go to portage county home of kent
state university
is new to the red level this week the
county's average daily cases have
increased from
five and a half an average of five and a
half on august 26
to almost 11 on september 4th
portage county also seen an increase in
average daily outpatient visits from
an average of six on september 10th to
an average of nine on september 15th
the majority of cases are being driven
by activities in off-campus housing
uh and to a lesser degree greek housing
so far in september
51 of portage county's cases are in
people who are younger than 29.
eric let's go and look at the high
incidence counties
as i said earlier the number of counties
with cases that exceed the cdc's
threshold for high
incidence is now at 21.
new counties added to this list or
athens delaware
green harrison and pickaway counties
a reminder that this number is important
because it means that cases are rising
steadily in a county even if the county
doesn't meet one of our
other indicators they still have a
significant number of the cases
having high case numbers increases the
chances of the virus spreading
throughout the community of steps are
not taking to slow
this down so let's talk about a few of
those counties and
again this is the list of the top 20
counties
putnam these are in order putnam mercer
athens harrison shelby butler henry
franklin
miami montgomery all glaze delaware
warren lawrence
dark clark and green pick away meigs and
wood so those are the
top counties based on
number of cases in the last two weeks
let's talk a little bit let's go to
athens county
our university students are certainly
impacting the county
outbreaks in athens have been associated
again with off-campus activities
harrison county harrison county
in the past two weeks as 29
actual new cases they've had a total of
60 since the beginning the pandemic so
you can see that that
you know was a county that didn't have a
lot of spread and now it's just
bam moved right up in the last two weeks
health department officials in harrison
county tell us about half the recent
cases or from a long-term care
facility outbreak delaware county
they have had 366 new cases during the
past two weeks
half of those are people who are younger
than 30.
greene county had a hundred and
the past two weeks 180 cases during the
past two weeks
of those cases uh 48
about half or younger than 30. um
as you know uh greene county has five
colleges universities here pickaway
county
uh has had 85 new cases during the past
two weeks eric let's look at this slide
so this is kind of this is a summary and
we'll
let me just get to that in a moment let
me let me talk about
some stories uh here we try to do this
every week and again not to
not to shame anybody but really it's
just to try to
understand about how this spreads
and how easily it does
this is spread associated with a funeral
in jefferson county
seven people are sick at least 22 have
had to be quarantined
the people who are quarantined are in
two different counties
and the people who are sick or in ohio
and in west virginia
uh in kaha county eight high school
volleyball players tested positive for
coven
a few of the players attended a large
graduation party
a couple of weeks before they started
feeling sick so again
i know people are asking about sports
and they're asking about what's going on
in schools but by and large
from what we can see it is
other events it is not the sports
competition at least so far
uh that we're not seeing much in but it
is students having parties and doing
doing other other things um
we have a couple new dashboards uh that
we want to share with you
um and uh
you know our kids obviously only have
one opportunity to grow up
and it's up to us the adults to ensure
that they have every opportunity of a
bright future so um let me let me look
at uh
let's look at look at some of these and
um
eric you know i i forgot to give go
through the
map you want to go back to the map uh
this is a map we haven't shown for a
while this one over here
um and these what you'll see is the red
these are the red counties that are that
are outlined in red
and we believe although we may be behind
in some of the data
but the color
fully remote is is the dark
blue hybrid is the light blue
and for those schools that are fully
back
uh five days a week uh it is in this
more white or uh
more whitish color um and so what we've
done is just circle these so you can see
in some counties
they're almost mostly remote you can see
other counties that
you know they are totally open and again
the only reason to show these is just
encourage people in those counties you
know
try to keep do everything you can to
keep the covet out of the school keep
your kids playing sports keep your kids
in school
uh that's where we're seeing uh you know
the red counties so
um let's go to the next one eric um
so this is our first school dashboard
on september 3rd the health director
signed an order
establishing a reporting process for
schools when they have covered cases
in addition to notifying parents schools
are required to report covered cases to
the local health department
who then reports them weekly to the
department
of health uh and so this is how it is
how it looks and you'll be able you can
go i believe it's up now
uh or we'll be up sometime today uh
you'll be able to go to the county and
you'll simply be able to see how many
how many cases in the last week
how many cases that are cumulative
so those numbers will change i believe
the only schools that are up are the
schools that have had
incidents of cova and again i want to
just
say this because i think it's so very
very important um
because there's a student who's
associated with a school
who has tested positive is no reflection
on the teachers the principal
superintendent or anybody else school
could be doing absolutely everything
right
the school is going to reflect what is
going on in the community
the fact that they have
figured it out the parents have the
school has that this student has at
covid
and they've taken the appropriate action
working with the health department is a
positive thing
um and so we should look at that as a
positive thing and again
schools from what i can see and talking
to superintendents
uh and reports i'm getting back from
parents i think are doing a very very
good job
but this is just one more effort to
share
information uh about what's going on uh
in
in regard to covet most important thing
is that parents in that classroom
where that child was or parents
who have children who have been close in
contact with that child
certainly will that they're the first
ones to get notified and that's the most
important thing
let's go to the children's dashboard
this is a separate
dashboard the next new dashboard is
focused on children in covet
it was created in consultation with the
ohio children's
hospital association we are blessed in
ohio with some amazing children's
hospitals sometimes we take them for
granted
until we have to take a child there or
grandchild goes there and then we're
we realize how lucky we are to live in
ohio with so many great children's
hospitals
the dashboard includes information about
cases hospitalizations and deaths
one more troubling statistic and a lot
of statistics and i'm going to ask dr
manning in a moment to kind of
i've asked her to take a look at this
and you've heard from her before in
these press conferences
but but she will kind of ask her to take
a look at the
statistics and kind of report what she's
seeing
on there but these these will be
available to the public today
one of the more troubling statistics
when you look at this data is that black
children make up
45 percent of all hospitalized children
out of those children who in ohio who've
gotten coveted
but only 18 percent of the total
population
under 18 is black children
african-american children so that is
again a disturbing uh figure
uh dr manning thank you for joining us
are you
on there thank you for coming back and
we appreciate it
very much here yes thank you very much
for having me governor
matt i'm really excited about this
dashboard and the ability for families
and pediatricians to see this
kid's specific data um you know and
you've been a great steward of the fact
that data
really builds trust through transparency
it helps people feel informed
it lets us know how we're doing as a
region as a community as a school
district and
the data that's on the dashboard
currently really reflects the experience
that we've had across the state
as we come together as children's
hospitals through the ohio children's
hospital association
you've heard me share before that we're
incredibly fortunate that
children do not seem to get very ill
with covet but they do get coveted
and the data really reflects that we
have fairly consistent numbers of
children
positive with covid but fairly also
consistently low numbers of children who
are hospitalized or who are severely ill
with covid
you know and finally the the last thing
that this data really helps us do is it
helps us track
trends over time we want to know if this
is going to change
again we've been fortunate over time
that the trends have stayed very low for
children but if that changes the only
way for us to know if that's changing is
if we track
that data over time well doctor
talking about that we've been out there
six months
and i know you've been watching this
very closely
not only watching it but but dealing
with with patients
what have we learned and you talked
about a little bit but what else have we
learned about children during this
period of time or maybe
what don't we know well we do know that
children who are older and more mobile
and more social tend to be more likely
to get coveted
we do know that children as they get
older and have other health conditions
make
could be more seriously ill um we also
know that children
can be asymptomatic with covid and that
you know that specifically strikes a lot
of fear uh for people i think that kids
might be that there might be lots of
children
walking around carrying covet but you
know on the on the reverse we also know
through testing thousands and thousands
of children in ohio
before they go into surgery or have
other procedures children who are
asymptomatic we know that the percentage
of those children is
that have covet is exceptionally low
it's about one percent
uh and so even though we know that
children can be asymptomatic with coven
you know the overwhelming majority of
children who are walking around without
symptoms do not have covet
which is very reassuring and finally
we're learning and experiencing right
now as kids go back to school that the
practices that we've discussed before
the
safe practices of wearing a mask keeping
some distance
using hand hygiene and cleaning surfaces
we know that those things keep kids safe
and if kids are safe
the adults in school are safe and if
kids are safe the adults at home are
safe
so it's all connected that's great
doctor thank you and
and so for a parent a parent who's not a
doctor let's say
and who wants to look at this what
what do you look at and how can you how
can you use this how can this inform
anybody who's watching today so i would
tell parents of
different age children look at the data
as it's broken down by age groups that's
incredibly helpful and again you'll see
that in certain age groups the rates
tend to be a little higher
i would tell parents to look at the
region in which they live
um so that they understand what disease
is like in their community
as you've said that what's happening in
the community really impacts what
happens in the schools
and then if and when we have data that's
school specific i know that families are
really really hungry for that kind of
data it reminds me of the data that we
shared within our health systems early
on
um that we were all hungry for we wanted
to know how many patients were positive
how many
staff members might be positive because
that informed how we move forward
and finally i would really emphasize
that this data is so critically
important for primary care providers and
pediatricians
pediatricians always have their finger
on the pulse of what's going on in the
community they're always aware of what's
what's going around whether it's strep
or flu or things like that
and now this really enriches their
knowledge even more so that if somebody
were to go to their pediatrician
and that pediatrician knew that that
coveted was
occurring at different rates in that age
group or in that region
that would really impact how they would
practice with that family and that child
um
so lots of richness in this data great
let me just close with one
last question we had reported yesterday
a case of flu
it was an adult was not a child in
putnam county
so we're getting into the flu season and
i wonder
what is the protocol what's the
recommendation
in regard to children as far as flu
shots
so thank you so much for referencing
that governor because it's so important
this season more than ever that children
six months and older can get a flu shot
starting now
starting today this is the time to do it
before the season's really busy before
so that you have a chance to develop
your response you really don't want to
be
the parent of the child who experiences
what it's like to have a child who has
flu and covet we don't want to learn
what that is we may have to learn that
but we shouldn't have to learn that
because a flu vaccine
is so helpful and so preventative so go
today start today contact your
pediatrician
and get your flu shot doctor
thanks for joining us again and we hope
to
bring you back if you're willing to in
the in the future we appreciate it
absolutely
very much um to continue on
what dr manning said last week friend i
got our flu shots john got his flu shot
as dr manning said it's critically
important to get a flu vaccine this year
we are now in into the into the season
even though the flu obviously cannot
protect you from covet
as dr manning said it's this is not
something that we
any of us adults or children want to
learn about how kovad
and the flu together work uh not
something we want to see
it really the flu shot's another layer
of protection uh to keep yourself your
family those who
you love and who are around you healthy
uh getting the shot helps reduce
your risk of spreading that flu prevents
strain on our healthcare system
and our healthcare providers keeps our
workforce
healthy it also can keep you from
getting really sick
and one of the things that the doctors
tell us
that if it may not even if it doesn't
totally prevent the flu
it may decrease the severity of
of that illness which is so very
important and particularly important
this year when the covet is out there
as well flu shots are available at your
doctor's office retail pharmacies
federally qualified health
centers that we have throughout the
state also have the flu shot available
so one things that i've enjoyed doing i
hope you have as well is hearing from
some of our superintendents
out there who are doing something that
superintendents have
not had to do for a hundred years and
that is deal with
with a real pandemic and i think they're
doing a very very good job
first up is justin jennings uh chief
executive officer of youngstown city
school district
uh
jennings you on there yes yes sir
well thank you for joining us we we we
appreciate it uh very very much i see a
couple football helmets back there
it is football season uh tell us tell us
how you're
approaching uh what's going on in
youngstown schools or
are you all remote are you in person
what are you
yeah we decided to go remote about three
months ago so we are
we are working through the remote system
we have all of our devices
and and we've started and we've also
allowed
uh we have allowance for all of our
scholars to have a hotspot or to have
hardware
wired from internet access
so that's very i think that's very very
important uh
you told me when we were talking the
other day that you all made that
decision early
then you started i mean one of one of
the challenges we always have and
certainly we had in the spring
uh was students in rural areas but
sometimes also in urban areas
might not have
the connections uh they might not be
able to uh you know have a laptop or
some way to pull that down so you're
you've taken care of basically 100 of
your students out there you think uh who
now has
have the ability to connect in yes yep
if they um if they have hot spots we try
to provide one for each scholar at the
house because we know sometimes if you
have four or five people
on the internet at the same time it
doesn't run as fast and if they
didn't have anything we we provided a
home from spectrum
we provided a home internet access for
them so
tell me a little bit about uh
how your teachers are doing and you know
how how this learning
uh is going well because because we
started so
so early we it afforded us the
opportunity to
train our teachers in the summer so it's
still a learning curve zoom is new for
everybody i mean
i don't think any anybody who said you
wanted to be an educator early i don't
think they had a class on remote
learning so this is something that's
kind of a learning curve for all of us
and the teachers have been very positive
more for their health and safety
it has been something that's been really
positive we're still allowing our
teachers to work from home
or they have the choice with social
distancing to work from their classroom
tell me a little bit about wellness
dollars
one of the things that the legislature
provided
and you know we came up with this
proposal sent to the legislature they
embraced it was the wellness dollars and
you and i were talking the other day a
little bit about that you want to tell
us how what you've done
with those and because i thought that
was kind of it was unique what you're
doing really
right absolutely i mean we know we know
that health and wellness is really
something that's positive that comes out
from
this culvert virus is really looking at
the disparities in in our health care
system and
one of those things for youngstown city
schools is we don't have any
pediatricians within our city limits to
service our scholars
so what we decided to do with our
wellness dollars is we we've teamed up
with quick meds and dr
ishmael and we we're going to have a
clinic in each of our of our high
schools that is going to be open
from 10 to 6 every every day during the
week and on saturdays as well to service
our scholars and our community as well
and as of yesterday after our press
release come came out we also have
uh we're also going to have vision there
as well so dr siegel from uh
um site for all will be be there as well
and that's the opportunity for us to do
this and our plan in the future is to be
able
to expand and have a clinic at each
school to service not only our scholars
and teachers but our community as well
wow that's a that has to be have a huge
impact uh when that's all
online a huge impact not only with the
students but with their families and
people other people in the community
absolutely absolutely we
we have a large uh percentage of our
scholars who have family members who
have been incarcerated so when they come
out
they don't have the opportunity for that
health care as well so we're going to
provide it for them as well
well i think that's really that's really
exciting what's the timeline on that how
soon does that
kick in we'll be we'll be open and ready
for business in
late october early november so we're
just getting the space together and then
we'll be good to go maybe a little
earlier than that
so with the students remotely though
you'll still you're still going to open
this
up for students to come in and for
community members yes by appointment we
will be prepared we'll follow all those
guidelines that we
we have normally with the social
distancing but with temperatures and
different things like that so
we've actually been using quick med to
do our testing for all of our scholar
athletes our clothing testing so that's
kind of how we started the relationship
well that's great thank you very much i
i was really excited about that when i
you and i talked the other day and i
wanted you to share it with uh
with everybody in the state so thank you
very much
good luck thanks to your students and
your teachers we thank them
for all they're doing uh next
i've invited uh greg enninger
uh the superintendent of vanguard
sentinel career and technology centers
they have campuses in tiffen uh in
fremont
uh thank you very very much for for
joining us we
we we appreciate it uh you've got uh
most kids most your students back on
campus now do you
we do thank you for having me uh sir uh
governor dewine
uh we do we we have about a thousand
fifty-one kids on campus
um we did start our start the school
year on a hybrid system
i mean our goal from the from the start
of the
end really of last school year was to do
whatever we needed to do
to open school with students on our
campuses
we really believe that careertech
education is instrumental in our
community and providing a trained
workforce
and we think that really became you know
really apparent during the pandemic
pandemic when you saw the workforce that
were deemed essential
there's just about every career field
that we have students training for
and to properly train them eventually
they have to get into the lab they got
to practice they got to demonstrate
they got to do that hands-on portion
which is paramount to their overall
skill development of their
of their career and to have that ability
to pass
on that specific industry credential so
we really did put in a lot of safety
requirements we followed the state
requirements we followed
industry sector specific requirements if
they were above and beyond what the
state had put out
we really felt that was important to
stay in line with business and industry
because that students would be seen in
their early placement opportunities or
full-time
job opportunities so then we decided we
basically created three schedules
that tried to hit every scenario that we
might
might face we did do it all students
back
a flexible hybrid that reduced kids to
50
capacity and a full distance remote
learning if we if we had to
but as i said there's only so much
online related work you can do with with
the hands-on and the career tech
but we did start in a hybrid um system
to give us the ability to
kind of start slow uh it was new for
for staff making sure all the social
distancing was taking place
the face covering the hygiene
pieces were all being followed and then
what we did look at
governor was we didn't look at every lab
the same
i mean every lab is a different size
every enrollment might be
might be different so we kind of took
the approach of
if we can continue to maintain the the
safety requirements
our goal was to get students back fully
and we were able to do that
actually started this week four days a
week we have all students except for
in three labs that that we didn't feel
like we could maintain that safety
requirement so we kept them on
on the hybrid everybody else is back and
we left the wednesdays
as a distance learning day um
for staff for additional planning and
for us to be able to do an
additional deep clean above and beyond
what we
are already doing so you've had to
really approach this
as a school but also as a business or a
manufacturing company or whatever
the the skill set is so you've had to
pull
best practices from industry plus best
practices from
from schools so that's been a
interesting challenge i'm sure
absolutely if you would walk in a few of
the labs such as
our cosmetology or health lab you would
see a double barrier system because
that's what's happening out in
in industry they have their face mask
and a face shield on
um so they are found and then staff is
doing an outstanding job
even when they came back they came back
with even more ideas
of how they could create a a more safe
environment to get
the students back on a full-time basis
versus a hybrid so
it's been a great start thus far
so i know this has been a difficult time
your instructors um how are they doing
your teachers how are they doing how
how are the students doing yeah the
students i'll tell you everybody um
really bought into to the safety we
haven't had any
major issues with that staff like i said
it has just been
outstanding with with getting their
their labs and classrooms ready
and prepared for students they all
wanted to see the students get back on
campus as well
and without that that proactive approach
i think from our
staff and knowing what they need to do
inside lab
portrayed to getting the students back
full time on on those four days so i
think everybody's doing really well
the kids are are working hard um and and
getting those skills that that that the
employers need to
to meet the uh job outlook
well that's great well thank you so much
for joining us and uh
best wishes to all your all your team
thank them for their
their hard work and uh thank the
students for their hard work
appreciate you thanks for having us
appreciate it thank you
since the start of the pandemic we've
worked hard to make sure we're
protecting ohio's
critical infrastructure workers who
keep food on our tables keep us healthy
keep us safe indeed in our critical
emphasis
indeed uh critical infrastructure
is part of that and some of the most
important people are migrant workers
our seasonal workers we've been working
with local health departments across the
state to monitor
and assist when outbreaks occur on the
farms where they work
in ohio there are currently around 5 600
known migrant and seasonal workers who
work at camps licensed
by the state of ohio many owners and
operators of these camps also provide
housing for workers and their families
this creates kind of a unique situation
for these communities where individuals
are working
traveling living together often and
often in very close proximity to each
other now these unique circumstances
have created a situation where workers
and their families
are are many times impacted uh by this
covid virus
since the beginning of the pandemic
we've been reaching out to these
communities
to help with testing and translation
services outreach
uh providing materials in english and
spanish to help workers stay safe from
cover 19 at work at home
and in the community we know that when
covet 19 outbreak
occurs when one of them occurs a swift
coordinated response can significantly
reduce spread and help those that are
sick
get the care that they urgently need uh
we're going to today
release our rapid response guide for
migrant and seasonal
farm workers to support local health
districts in developing a culturally
appropriate plan
to respond to an outbreak the department
of health has an interesting
kind of diagram or chart which i did not
bring
nor do i have in front of me but it
shows that how seasonal workers come in
at different periods of time basically
starting in march and so it's a it's an
on it's an ongoing process
and so you know it's it's not going to
be too many more months until that
process is starting again so we're glad
to get this
document out as part of what we've what
we have been doing
it will be available on our website at
coronavirus.ohio.gov
as part of our continued efforts from
the minority health
strike force in addition to help meet
the needs of the farm
working community ohio department of
health is awarding 2.6 million dollars
and cares at
funding to agriculture camp operators to
improve the health and safety of their
work sites
and camps to reduce kova 19 transmission
those improvements will primarily focus
on reducing housing density
installing touchless equipment
partitions and hand washing stations
now the department of health is also
partnering with the department of jobs
and family services
to distribute face masks hand sanitizers
disinfectant cleaner digital forehead
thermometers to workers and operators by
helping provide
really to provide these prevention tools
and providing information
we know that this will help slow the
spread
a quick waste wastewater update
since mid-july ohio's coronavirus
wastewater surveillance network has been
monitoring
incoming waste at wastewater treatment
plants around the state to test
for gene fragments of cova 19.
our team along with university
researchers
has seen a recent steady increase in the
number of viral gene copies
at two wastewater treatment plants one
is in dayton
the other is a columbus plant referred
to as the jackson
pike plant these findings
are information that we very quickly
pass on to the local health department
many times the health department is
directly involved in the gathering
of this data but the point is to get it
to the people who can use it
right on the ground the ohio department
of health
notified in one case the dayton
montgomery public health and
the columbus public health systems to
allow them to take appropriate action
again one more piece of information uh
and we think as this
continues to evolve uh it's going to
provide more
and more better information
testing of wastewater for cover 19 gene
frac fragments
can also be done on a smaller scale to
focus on targeted locations within a
treatment plant service area for example
the ohio state university has started
monitoring six
separate locations on campus samples
collected are being used by ohio state
alongside rapid student testing that
they're doing to better track cobit 19
on campus
the goal is to use these two data sets
to identify possible
infection spots that's what ohio state's
doing with the
with the uh with those two uh
rapid student testing as well as the
samples that we're talking about
we are currently testing in more than 30
cities across the state we'll expand
testing to more than 50 locations
uh in the next month all right we've got
a lot of questions
about halloween and we will be putting
out some
guidance tomorrow and so you can look
for that actual guidance tomorrow
now halloween historically in this state
has been a very community event
beggar's night has been a community
event and communities set the time
themselves uh they make the
determination about that so that will
not change
the local community will make the
determination if there's a beggar's
night
when that beggar's night is they will do
that i'm sure
in consultation with with their local
local health
departments parents in turn will do what
parents do and that is make a decision
uh about whether a child goes out on and
trick-or-treating
obviously celebrations this year will
not look like those in the years past
again face coverings and of course that
may not be a problem with
trick-or-treaters who are wearing a mask
and something else but
it's important to have that some mask on
hay rides haunted houses are much more
problematic
again we kind of come back as you look
at these things and
look at how close you are or your
children are going to be
to others many times hear strangers
how close they're going to be do they
have a mask on
do the other people have a mask on and
how long in proximity does that
last so when you look at for example
the haunted houses
you know probably a much higher risk
than the normal uh trick-or-treating
just because of the close proximity
uh inside those haunted houses so we'll
we'll continue we've got a while to go
uh until halloween we're gonna put the
initial guidance out
uh for everyone because we're getting a
lot of requests about that
as the virus evolves
again we will continue to update that if
that is in fact appropriate
and again in making all these decisions
as parents um
you know you make those decisions based
upon all the information that you can
get
uh with our color coding and all the all
the other things that we're providing
you know one one of the factors
obviously is how much spread is there in
in your community and so that's again
something that you can you can
consider um so we'll be having more
information
uh about that uh as i said we'll try
we're gonna put our release out tomorrow
um and just kind of outline
recommendations from the state health
department
today i'm pleased to announce that the
ohio department of jobs and family
services has now begun
distributing the 300 per week and lost
wages assistance to eligible unemployed
insurance
recipients so you should be starting to
get those checks those checks will
go back in time for whatever you are
eligible for
this assistance is available to ohioans
who receive traditional unemployment
benefits
pandemic unemployment assistance trade
readjustment assistance
shared work ohio or extended benefits
for weeks
ending august 1 through september
5. pua claimants
are receiving these payments first in a
staggered manner with individual
payments for each week they qualified
for the program
for those receiving other types of
unemployment benefits the necessary
system program update is
underway when it's complete individuals
will need to log into their accounts to
certify that they are unemployed
or working reduced hours because of coba
during eligible weeks
these individuals receive one
retroactive
retroactive payment for all weeks that
they qualify for
jobs and family services staff are
working to complete this program
as quickly as possible and they're
posting frequent updates on their
website
at jfs.ohio.gov
lwa so
that's will be coming if anyone has
questions they certainly can contact
jobs and family services but i wanted to
tell everyone that these checks are
starting now
out today
we want to remind everyone about the
census and so we have asked lydia
mahalik the development services agency
uh who is in charge of the census in
ohio to talk with us lydia
thank you for joining us i know you're
working very hard on the census
uh tell us how we're doing in ohio
good afternoon uh governor yeah actually
uh the state of ohio is doing well
uh as of this morning our self-response
rate is 69.9
which is the responses from ohioans
either over the phone
online or by mail and this actually
happens to be above
the national self-response rate our
total response rate which includes the
census door-to-door efforts
that are happening right now is actually
95 percent
which is above our response rate 10
years ago
but i got to tell you uh in our in our
self-response rate governor
we're still behind the state up north
we don't like that
they're within striking distance though
i believe that's absolutely correct
you're within striking distance so
that's right so what do people
need to know uh if you've not filled out
a form if you've not gone online if no
one's knocked on your door what do they
need to do
right well right now you can actually
complete your census today
by either going to 2020census.gov
or by calling one eight four four three
three zero
twenty twenty uh really easy to do the
census is safe
it's easy and it's so important
director thank you very much we
appreciate it like i like the flag in
the in the background there
only the best from flag city governor
black city
all right we appreciate it thank you
very much
we're ready for questions
governor our first question today is
from kevin landers at wbns in columbus
hello governor hey kevin uh several
weeks ago i asked you
if you would be returning money that you
received from first energy
have you been able to identify how much
money you received from first energy and
so well where did you return that money
to you said you were going to donate it
to charity
uh i will check with that as i recall
we gave that money to the food banks in
ohio but i'll
confirm that with laurel and
my team and make sure that we get you
that
exact information
next question is from jeff redick at
wsyx
in columbus afternoon governor
a newly released report that was
obtained by abc news
coming right from the white house showed
that franklin county is still a county
that is of
at least some concern if not major
concern for the federal government
uh franklin county of course on the
state's
kind of color-coded heat map has gone
down and remained in orange
but i'm wondering if you still have
great concern for franklin county as it
leads the state or if
that orange level is in any way
if you think dissuading people from
taking the necessary precautions
well we ask people to look at two things
and i don't know eric you have the
ability to put the
top 20 back up again
we look at two things and we ask them to
look at two things because
you can't get a picture by just one set
of statistics like
it's like a baseball player you know you
know what they batting average but if
you don't know
runs bad at in and et cetera then you
don't have the full picture
and so we try to give them as much
information as we can
uh if you if you look um
look on here franklin county has can't
remember what franklin county number was
uh but i have i have those i have those
numbers
of incidents but their their
incident numbers have stayed it's
continued to stay high so we
you know we are concerned about that um
and we remain concerned about it
so um you know you look at you look at
two
things you look at the list you look at
the look at the
at the color code so i mean
one thing the federal government has you
know
they go by positivity
which is an interesting number per
county
we hope to have positivity numbers up
for every county
shortly we think candidly
that the federal government's positivity
numbers are not
always as precise as they could be
because it's our my understanding is
they are using the hospitals
so my understanding is that if someone
comes out of circleville
they're in in a franklin county hospital
that that would be attributed uh to
franklin county so
we're we don't think those numbers are
exactly right but we do agree with the
federal government
uh that there is a certainly a concern
with franklin franklin county
and look a lot of this is is we're
looking at a lot of what's going on with
thousands and thousands of students who
are back in school
uh you know what we continue to see
uh i think our schools are doing a good
job uh ohio state who's the biggest one
obviously in franklin county i think
it's doing a good job
uh the testing tracing but what we
continue to see from
at all universities is off-campus and
off-campus activity
and so we you know we worry we worry
about that as well but
the mayor and i talk a lot we talked
earlier today and
we continue to stay in very close touch
as we do with the two health departments
next question is from joe ingles at ohio
public radio and television
good afternoon governor hi joe hi
um candidates are starting to come to
ohio
we saw vice president pence here
recently
uh president trump is coming um and then
the democrats you know we're probably
going to start seeing
more of their um you know events in ohio
these typically draw large gatherings
and if you look at the crowds on some of
these gatherings they're not masked
they're not wearing masks there's a mask
mandate
in effect in ohio my question is are you
going to enforce that mask
mandate at those kind of events well joe
let me kind of go through this
throughout this pandemic
we have not put orders on
uh we've not closed churches
other states have closed churches we
have a great respect
i have a great respect for the first
amendment great respect for freedom of
religion
uh while we have urged churches to have
uh you know people be very very careful
uh we've never closed them the only
thing we've done with churches is to
require
mask by the person who's not the
celebrant or
person who's not talking but so we've
done that
in regard to demonstrations and i know
some people
were irritated with me about this but we
said look
this is an exercise of first amendment
now at the same time
we said please please please wear a mask
uh keep us distance and and every time
we continue to talk about that
political campaigns whether it's joe
biden
former vice president biden or whether
it's the president trump
or whether it's a local candidate if
they're having a political rally
we do not we exclude them
from that order but
we really urge anyone who's conducting a
rally
anyone who's attending a rally
while we don't require you to do it uh
the order does not say you have to
but please wear a mask please
do social distancing what you don't want
to see
is is a in any event whether it's a
wedding a funeral whatever it is
it become an incident where someone gets
sick
uh and so you know again any candidate
who comes into ohio any candidate who
campaigns in ohio
please do everything you can uh have
everybody wear a mask
and for the people who show up and uh
you know we would just ask them please
wear a mask um
you think that is just you know just
absolutely vitally
vitally important next question is from
ben
schwartz at wcpo in cincinnati
hi governor hi ben i have a question
here sent
in from a wcpo viewer um this viewer
says her father
is in a nursing facility and that she's
sent countless emails to your office and
other state agencies asking to see some
change in how
nursing facilities are handling covet
19.
in this viewer's words she asks quote
what is
what is visitation going to look like
going forward
within a month it's going to be too cold
outside to have outside visitation
end quote this is just a number of
one of a number of concerns raised by
our viewers so
i guess the overall question is moving
forward how will we see rules and
guidelines regarding nursing home
visitations evolve
and could we expect to see any more
lenience
on visitations in any way well
we get these calls and my heart goes out
to anybody who's
not being able to visit their loved one
uh for
a number of months uh we have opened up
nursing homes as far as
the state's orders the health orders
we've said they can provide visitation
we suggest uh and say that it should be
outside
uh we know that winter will come
eventually uh
much as we don't want to come and so
we're now working on how visitation can
take place inside
if you have a loved one and you cannot
get into a nursing home
that is the nursing home that is
stopping you from going in
it is not the health department
so again they may have a reason they may
have a good reason
but it is it is not the health
department we have
for a number of months said people
should be able to visit
loved ones in a nursing home now look we
don't want anybody going in there
you know visiting who's sick you know we
want them doing it outside we want to
wear a mask
so you know those are normal precautions
that we
you know know should take place and
expect to take place
but i continued also to get calls i
continue also to get texts and emails
from people who say i can't go visit my
loved one
and you know again that that is
something that we are not stopping
uh that is that is the nursing home that
is not letting you in
and now as i said they may have a good
reason uh
but that's you should contact that
nursing home and find out what that is
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
hey governor max just looking through
the
school database put out today it looks
like most of the data is on the district
level
and considering the fact that some of
these school districts have dozens of
different
schools and buildings wouldn't it be
more helpful to uh
list it via building as opposed to
district-wide
well we get into the question um and
we've discussed this before uh
i don't know whether you and i have
discussed it but the issue
uh about the law saying that you cannot
put out
information that would identify someone
as having covet or identifying anything
about health
issues around one individual we've
always felt that the most important
thing was that
parents parents of children in that
school will be notified
so they are being notified
first of all the parents of any child
who came in contact with that child
who was sitting with that child anything
else that's those are the first people
that should be contacted
and to my knowledge are being contacted
by our school second
you have a child in that building and
there's some coveted in that building or
a child has built
as coveted you're supposed to be
notified so those are the people who
have the most it seems to me
important that they they in fact be
notified we've encouraged schools
to put dashboards up so that anybody in
the community
can can look up and and find that out
but we can't micromanage this and we
can't micromanage it down to the point
where in a small school system they
might
be giving out information that would
identify someone as having coveted which
is illegal
we cannot no they cannot do that we
cannot do that i cannot require them and
should not require them
to do that so what we said at the
beginning and we had people
with people in schools who said you know
this is too burdensome uh we had other
people uh
you know in the press who said you're
not giving us enough
we're gonna let this run for a few weeks
we're gonna kind of see how it works out
we're going to see how the information
is flowing out and then
you know if it's appropriate to to
adjust it further
we will certainly do that but you know
again
our goal throughout this has been put
out a lot of information
we've been focused most particularly
though on actual information
something you can take and do something
with that with that piece of information
but we're trying to get as much
information as we legally can
can get out
next question is from laura hancock at
cleveland.com
thanks governor two quick questions um
convention centers
are still not allowed to operate in ohio
as like their normal intended way
any update on when gatherings more than
10 people might be allowed in convention
centers
and then the second has to do with the
school dashboard
is the data helpful when it contradicts
what individual school dashboards are
saying
cases on the state dashboard seem to be
far fewer than what schools have
previously
reported for instance in cuyahoga county
health officials announced 51 cases
in individual districts up from 23 the
previous week
the state's dashboard is only showing
three
i'll check on it look this thing went
live today
there's bound to be problems um we're
going to fix the problems
you know keep in mind that this goes
through sunday
uh and so the data would be relevant as
of sunday if somebody makes an
announcement something happened monday
tuesday or wednesday then it would be
different
i don't know if that's the situation
here or not but we certainly
will run everything down we have no
incentive not to have accurate
information
and we're going to try to make make it
accurate but
again a lot of schools 600 some school
districts
a lot of reporting coming in we'll check
on it if there's discrepancies there
we'll try to run those down
next question is from spencer hickey at
hannah news services
thank you this is for the governor and
director mahalik
if you'd be able to answer this you
talked about the census rates
statewide would he be able to comment on
rates for regional areas particularly
appellation in southeastern ohio
and if there's continued state efforts
towards those areas
yeah is is director mahalik still on the
line eric
yeah i'm here governor okay could you
hear that did you hear the question
i could yeah and i don't have those
rates specifically with me right now but
we'd be happy to get you that
information
we'll get we'll get is there
state efforts specifically to promote
the census in those areas
director you're muted if you were saying
something yeah absolutely spencer we're
we're doing everything to promote the
census uh statewide we've actually
worked with our partners in the
appalachian region
um to do some some media awareness and
those types of things so
um you know the the state has its entire
uh complete count commission
uh but there are complete count
commissions uh all across
the state as well in different counties
and cities and
there's certainly been an effort to
ensure that we get those hard to count
populations
uh that you're referencing uh aware of
the census
and uh uh in terms of what that
percentage looks like uh we'll have to
get back to you on that
yeah and lydia i wonder if you could
directly if you could
talk about the door-to-door
uh because door-to-door is one way that
you know you try to reach those folks
who you haven't reached any other way
how is that how does that work in ohio
what are we doing yeah well right now uh
the census actually has
uh census takers out amongst uh the
different communities uh
and they're stopping by doors of
individuals who are households
who have not yet uh responded to the
postcards that have been sent
uh reminders that have been sent uh over
the last
six or eight months uh and really that
they're going door-to-door right now
they're wearing masks they have
you know government ids that identify
them as official census takers
they're all following the proper health
guidelines and i would say if no one's
home
they will put the information at your
door so that you can go ahead and go
online
or call the phone number to respond to
the census
and if someone has let's say you've got
a
a family member who maybe just moved
they moved in from another state
how does that person get contacted so
the best thing uh for that individual to
do is to either go online to
2020census.gov
or to call the phone number which is
1-844-330-2020
director thank you very much you're
welcome governor
next question is from jim province at
the toledo blade
hi governor hi jim um last night vice
president mike pence urged the crowd in
zanesville to applaud you for your
performance as governor but many in the
crowd responded with booze
why do you think you're getting that
kind of a reaction to many within your
own party
and do you plan to attend the
president's rally monday night
in toledo yeah he may be another
location in ohio um i hope to be with
him
um i don't think they've announced the
second location yet
uh i tend to be with him at the second
location so i won't
scoop the white house but i think
there's going to be another announcement
unless things have changed in the last
several hours and so i would intend to
be with him then
um look as far as
why some people in the crowd reacted the
way they did
um look it's uh we're making tough
decisions
or we're making decisions um and
we understand that this is a this is a
tough time uh
we have some people who are unemployed
uh we have people who
you know don't want to wear a mask and
you know a lot of different things so
i'm going to continue to focus on what
i need to do i think that's my job i
think that's what people elected me to
do
and we'll keep doing that
next question is from adrian robbins at
wcmh
in columbus hi governor thank you for
being here
um obviously president trump will be
here on monday which
many are talking about and many in ohio
are concerned with
a large crowd getting together that he
normally draws
no matter the candidate that could be
coming to ohio over the next several
weeks before the election are you
concerned what these kind of rallies
could do with our numbers
especially considering ohio is already
dealing with
schools going back college is going back
possible flu coming up and
and the spread that we're seeing in our
rural areas
well no matter who is putting on an
event um
you know our answer is the same yeah and
and that is if it's protected by the
first amendment
it's protected by the first amendment
but uh
we urge everyone to wear a mask we urge
everyone to keep
their social distance we know that
gatherings
by their very nature can
lead to spread we just we know that
that's that's a fact and so the basics
have not
changed we also know that outside
or a place that's well ventilated is
obviously better than
inside and there's not the ventilation
so you know they're all the variables
that we talk about and we just
you know no matter who's going to have
an event whatever that event is
you know we would just whether it is
related to
a campaign or not we would ask people
just to be very careful
this is a time when we have as you saw
by the map you know we have spread
all over uh this this state and we're
seeing more and more of these counties
you know go from yellow to orange and uh
that's that's not a
not a good thing we're hovering in about
the same number of cases a little over a
thousand cases a day
our positivity number is pretty good
it's been going down
we're very happy about that but we also
know that winter's coming
and things you know
some of the scientists predict things
get rougher in the winter as far as
the virus so we we carry on we just ask
everyone
you know keep the essentials in mind
distance
mask outside better than inside
so next question is from jack windsor
at wmfd in mansfield hi chad
hi governor on tuesday i cited the
federal case in pennsylvania
pennsylvania and asked you if ohioans
needed to earn their freedoms
uh you said our rights are god given and
government powers are not unfettered in
halting them yesterday representative
grindel announced a bill that seeks to
lift the state of emergency in ohio
and existing health care orders grendel
mentioned the violation of the
separation of powers
in the continued state of emergency and
said quote government cannot protect us
from every single one of life's risks
and later said 99 of us we now know will
be safe from this virus
yesterday your office said you would not
support grendel's legislation
considering your answer on tuesday the
federal decision from judge
stickman in pennsylvania and given the
latest science showing
that exposure to the common cold
provides covet t cell immunity
in 40 to 60 percent of the population
meaning a vaccine
may not even be needed for most people
why not follow the science and support
the legislation
to end the state of emergency and then
how are we doing with the antibody test
results
thank you well i i wish it was as simple
as passing a law to
get us away from the emergency that
we're in i mean factually we are
in an emergency whether it's declared or
not
we've declared it as an emergency but
passing a law saying it's not an
emergency is not going to make it not an
emergency
and i say that with all with all due
respect to her she and i were
talking the other day on a bill signing
that she had sponsored
uh so i have great deal of respect for
her but look passing a bill just doesn't
make it not an emergency we have an
emergency
we have significant spread um we have
people dying
and we can do this and
you know we can do two things at once we
can keep our economy going
um we can go to our kids sporting events
we can do a lot of different things but
we still have to do
some careful things in wearing a mask
and keeping the social distance
are very very necessary so
no i certainly do not support that we
have an emergency and
when we're done with the emergency we'll
we'll be done with emergency
and i can't wait next question
is from jackie borchardt at the
cincinnati enquirer
good afternoon governor as you mentioned
earlier there is a
a game tonight and many cincinnati
bengals fans might be heading across the
river to kentucky
to watch the games since uh governor
beshear pushed back its liquor curfew to
11 p.m
an extra hour compared to ohio ohio bar
owners want to know will you follow suit
and push back the curfew here
i don't know yet i mean look we're going
to consult
people in different communities across
the state of ohio
as you know as i've reported before
mayor cranley would like to see us
do that but we have other mayors in
major cities in the state who do not
want us to do that
feel that this has been a very helpful
and slowing the spread down
you know cincinnati is in a unique
position because people can go across
certainly can go across the river i just
let me use this occasion also to say
since we're talking about football and i
plan on watching
watching the game tonight
should be a lot of fun but
you know our concern really is as
the nfl starts back up and now we'll
have ohio state
in the not too distant future you know a
lot of us are going to be watching
tv watching these games a lot of us like
to do with friends and that's great a
lot of us
like to go into bars and watch it and
that's fine too
we just asked people you know when we
talk about football the big question was
is it safe
you know i have a concern frankly about
what this
what results if a lot of people are
getting together in bars
and we saw some pictures the other day
um
you know the first weekend of football
nfl and
you know people were not distancing and
so those are just by their nature
dangerous and so we can enjoy the nfl
uh the bengals and the browns and we can
enjoy ohio state and we can enjoy
uc and other other teams that are
playing but
we can do it we ought to try to do it in
a safe way and that would be my
my request if people could could do
could do that
next question is from justin dennis at
mahoningmatters.com
good afternoon governor i'd like to get
back to nursing homes for
a moment we heard from a group of
ohioans who are pushing for
some way to offer additional care or
face time with their loved ones in
nursing homes
possibly by designating them as
essential caregivers
other states have enacted legislation to
that effect which would allow those
relatives inside nursing homes
and to visit with their loved ones for
for longer is there anything
that you can share about the state's
upcoming guidelines
uh that might align with that and when
can we expect to learn more about that
plan
yeah again i want to emphasize though
the nursing homes
for months uh have been permitted
uh and we've given them guidance about
allowing visitation
and i know it's very frustrating that
there are nursing homes they're not
letting people visit or they're letting
them visit for 15 minutes
i mean unless they're really really busy
seems to me more than 15 minutes should
be allowed
we want them to do it safely we don't
want the virus coming in but they're
doing it outside now they're doing
people have face masks so i i just would
say
that unless the nursing home has coveted
in there or some real reason not to
have that the nursing home should be
allowing people to visit
they need to be careful we're now coming
up with protocol
uh which director mcelroy will be
announcing shortly
uh about how that will happen as it gets
colder
and you know visitation outside is
obviously going to be difficult or
impossible
and how we'll be able to we hope
carefully move that in
in the long run in the long run the more
testing we can get into nursing homes
um the more we're going to be able to
have visitation
and the more we're going to have life
that will be more normal
for the people who the residents of the
nursing homes and so we're working on
that
very very hard working on that this
morning uh and we'll continue to
to work on that so you know we're seeing
more and more testing coming out we're
seeing the cost go down
you know and and the more testing that
we can do
uh inside nursing homes the safer it's
it's going to be but we still
as you know are losing a lot of people
in nursing homes
and it's just it's just you know breaks
my heart
and so we'd still have to be careful we
can't just say
we're not going to be careful so when
people go into a nursing home to visit
when we get to the point where they're
physically going inside
you know again it's going to even be
more careful more important that they
not
have temperature that they not
be positive at some point we're going to
be able to get
to the place where we in addition to the
normal screenings that we have in
in effect uh wearing masks and those
other things
that a test will be available at a
reasonable cost and that person will
take that test wait 15 minutes and if
they pass that test
they would be able to go into that into
that nursing home
now it's not 100 not perfect but that
would be one more screening device
added to the devices the things the mask
and the other things that we already
have so that's kind of
where we're going in the future next
question is from marty schlayton at the
ohio capitol journal
good afternoon governor marty
um do you agree with former governors
taft and celeste
that ohio should pre-pay uh postage on
absentee ballots
and if you do agree what do you make of
the controlling board's decision
not to do so yeah i think i said last
time um
or at least i thought about maybe i
didn't say it um
that i'm in favor of that but i also say
that we still have a good system in ohio
without paying for that
we do have a situation where you know
everyone got
the application that was mailed to them
uh
so you know ohio is aggressive secretary
of state is aggressive uh
i think you know we're doing a good job
in ohio in letting people vote and
trying to make it as broad as we can and
giving them every opportunity but no i i
would have
i'm on the other side of that but it was
it was clear to me
some time ago that there simply was not
an appetite in the general assembly to
do that
uh and in fact that they were members of
the general assembly who did not favor
doing that
next question is from john reed at
gongword news service
good afternoon governor john um
uh treasurer sprague suggested today
spending 100 million dollars from the
coronavirus relief fund on
grants for small businesses to help them
through that is that something
you would support um and do you have any
other ideas of
how the rest of that money might be used
yes i do uh we're working on that i
intend to work further on this weekend
i'm glad to get his recommendation i
know that
you know he was putting that out
and we've received recommendations from
other people
talking with members of the legislature
about this we should have
recommendations to come out next week
so we'll stay tuned we'll have more
governor next question is the last
question for today and it belongs to jim
otte of whio in dayton
governor let's return to football uh to
what degree are you
satisfied with the protocols to keep
players coaches
coaches and staff on the field safe
and if you feel safe about that would
you support
returning fans to the stands let's say
for example 6 000 fans at ohio stadium
as will be at the game tonight
jimmy talking about um we got three we
got high school we got college we got
uh nfl we're talking about all three
what specific to college the big ten
returning
yeah are the protocols in in place
yeah look i i think the protocols are in
place at ohio state
um i can only talk about ohio state but
i i'm convinced the protocols
are in place uh dr borchers
uh who's advising the big ten uh is from
ohio state
i've talked to him on numerous occasions
about you know
how things are going at ohio state and
testing the athletes not just the
athletes for
football but all the athletes i think
they have a very very good protocol
you know look as far as putting people
in the stands
that first is the decision of the big
ten then a decision of ohio state
there is no reason that we could not do
something similar at ohio state to what
we're doing with the bengals and the
browns they both came forward with
very good plans we basically divided the
stadium up in four
areas 1500 people per area which is what
our maximum is for high school
and so uh i'm you know convinced that
that will work out
very well i think it's going to work out
very well tonight we'll turn on tv and
watch
but i think it's going to work out well
with the browns and
the bengals um again you know the real
the real concern uh is now what happens
inside that stadium with 6 000 people
the concern is getting in
getting out uh and what the what the
congregating together i mean that's just
what you
you worry about from a purely from a
health point of view
uh is people you know congregating
together in close proximity to each
other
uh i think what you're going to see
tonight with the with the browns uh
they're gonna have people spread out
people are going to be wearing masks
people are going to be safe they're
going to be safe inside
inside inside the stadium and so
certainly we could expand that
if ohio state wanted to we could expand
something similar to that
to to ohio state uh you know cleveland
has done
uh the right thing uh and the city has
done the right thing
you know doing everything they could to
discourage tailgating everything they
could
discourage the congregation um you know
we
all love tailgating i love tailgating uh
but
you know this again this is a time when
we're
we're kind of shifting things off we're
making some sacrifice here so we can do
something else and
being able to have the game be able to
attend the game for some people
uh and for the rest of us to watch it on
tv and the players to be able to play
uh you know that's those are all all all
good things but
um you know the congregating together is
just something that's uh
not not healthy
jim thank you very much uh we look
forward to seeing everyone
uh on tuesday we hope you have a good
weekend
thank you very much
