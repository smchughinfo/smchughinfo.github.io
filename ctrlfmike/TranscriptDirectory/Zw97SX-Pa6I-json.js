    "doing that's a good chart to look at",
    "the other one of course is is our one",
    "that we unveil every thursday",
    "which is the color",
    "coded uh by county",
    "let me go to another chart uh we update",
    "this daily",
    "at two o'clock we'll go to the next one",
    "eric",
    "yeah and what this shows is",
    "number of cases run every day",
    "and then uh it also shows on the chart",
    "uh the positivity",
    "and so this",
    "positivity is displayed for that day",
    "and a seven day running positivity is a",
    "number that one of the numbers many",
    "numbers we look at it's a significant",
    "number",
    "what we're seeing is um the good news is",
    "that our seven-day moving average of",
    "test is over 32 000 tests per day again",
    "not where we want to be but it",
    "continues to to go upward we are seeing",
    "uh very good news a decline in",
    "positivity we are today at a seven day",
    "average of 2.9",
    "2.9 and",
    "a lot of what we're going to talk about",
    "today is how we get ready",
    "for winter a beautiful day outside in",
    "ohio",
    "and it's hard to think about winter but",
    "it will be coming and the concern of",
    "course",
    "is as people move inside more we're in",
    "more confined spaces",
    "we see the spread of the virus so we",
    "want to get our positivity number",
    "obviously down as low as we can we're",
    "certainly headed in the in the right",
    "direction we hope to see it",
    "get get even lower we're unveiling a new",
    "um dashboard today uh",
    "we've continued throughout this six",
    "month period to try to",
    "give you as much information as we can",
    "so people can look at this",
    "and policymakers whether in the",
    "department of health or local health",
    "departments",
    "or the legislature governor's office can",
    "make decisions",
    "let me talk about this one there's a",
    "coven 19 data dashboard called",
    "case demographics and you're seeing one",
    "page",
    "displayed up there now by selecting this",
    "specific tool",
    "under demographics menu you can access",
    "coven 19 case",
    "data by race and break it down by age",
    "and by county",
    "and compare it to the overall ohio",
    "population",
    "improving data collection and reporting",
    "as well as creating a",
    "publicly available dashboard were",
    "recommendations from our covet",
    "19 minority health strike force so we're",
    "glad to",
    "comply with their request and it's good",
    "it's a good thing to have",
    "this dashboard helps better track health",
    "inequities",
    "and disparities and this data can help",
    "put critical decisions into context",
    "for policy makers again this data will",
    "be available today on the covet",
    "19 data dashboard at",
    "coronavirus.ohio.gov",
    "with the election coming up i want to uh",
    "brief you on a voter registration issue",
    "which arose recently",
    "and has since been remedied but i want",
    "to",
    "talk a little bit about it our ohio",
    "benefits",
    "system provides online services",

    "where they can",
    "my understanding a place where they can",
    "actually click that if they want that",
    "the department of administrative",
    "services recently became aware",
    "that due to a system error some ohioans",
    "who asked to receive a voter",
    "registration form",
    "at that particular time did not",
    "get sent a form approximately 59",
    "000 ohioans were affected by the error a",
    "review of affected individuals",
    "determined",
    "that of this group approximately 18 900",
    "were already registered to vote and an",
    "additional",
    "7 500 received voter registration forms",
    "from ohio benefits to other",
    "separate transactions that left 32",
    "400 who had not received a form at the",
    "time",
    "of this review um a week ago monday",
    "das sent voter registration forms to all",
    "59 000 individuals so i want to thank",
    "des for identifying this issue and",
    "getting it fixed so that went out uh",
    "eight days ago",
    "seven or eight days ago to those 59",
    "000 individuals who had clicked",
    "something on a benefits",
    "that they indicated that they wanted an",
    "application",
    "we've been uh bringing in",
    "superintendents um",
    "they're doing a phenomenal job and i",
    "again want to thank all our",
    "superintendents our",
    "teachers our school staff educational",
    "service centers",
    "for working so very very hard to keep",
    "our kids safe",
    "and to continue to teach our children",
    "this certainly is",
    "no ordinary time and",
    "i just want to thank each and every one",
    "of you for going that extra mile and",
    "doing those things to",
    "educate our children as we have",
    "been doing since the start of the year",
    "we're inviting superintendents and",
    "joining us today",
    "is jeffrey ramnet's superintendent with",
    "barberton",

    "for",
    "joining us thank you very much for",
    "having me governor i really appreciate",
    "it",
    "well is it is it a is it a pretty day in",
    "barberton today",
    "oh the sun's always shining in barbecue",
    "especially when the magics take the",
    "field so we're excited about that",
    "well that that's good i missed the",
    "parade this year the parade's always fun",
    "i know we do miss that and the pancake",
    "breakfast as well so yeah",
    "well next year hopefully we won't have",
    "masks on when we see you there",
    "we we hope to be there we hope you'll be",
    "there",
    "well let me tell you a little bit about",
    "your school district and um",
    "for people who don't know barberton tell",
    "me about the district",
    "and then kind of tell us how you you're",
    "breaking this out you've got some kids",
    "online you've got other kids",
    "who are in the classroom you prepared",
    "for it this summer",
    "just kind of bring us up to date what's",
    "going on in barberton",
    "uh barbara city school district we serve",
    "about 3 800 students",
    "we are a very hard-working blue-collar",
    "town",
    "our parents work hard the city the city",
    "people work hard",
    "our teachers work extremely hard we do",
    "have challenges",
    "we're on about 72 percent free and",
    "reduced",
    "uh we have about 20 percent students who",
    "are on special needs",
    "um but we we love it we love taking care",
    "of our students and uh our motto is",
    "we meet each child where they're at and",
    "we work with them to grow them",
    "uh year to year till they we get them on",
    "one of the three e's which is enrolled",
    "enlisted or employed",
    "so we're very very proud of the things",
    "in the programming that we have here in",
    "barberton",
    "our plan was very important to us for",
    "many reasons",
    "i know in the spring everybody had a",
    "pretty tough time",
    "uh parents uh they developed a greater",
    "appreciation for what teachers do",
    "um so we listened to our tea we listened",
    "to our parents we met with parent groups",
    "we did surveys and really i would say",
    "three-fourths of our parents",
    "wanted our students to come back into",
    "school and",
    "we also had we heard from parents that",
    "uh felt that they",
    "didn't feel comfortable letting their",
    "parent their students go back into",
    "school",
    "so we looked at our resources uh luckily",
    "we had uh passed a few",
    "renewal levies uh just recently and we",
    "looked at our resources we looked at our",
    "staffing",
    "and initially we were talking about",
    "maybe bringing in the younger students",
    "but as we looked at that we we felt we",
    "need our students in front of us",
    "it's been about 22 weeks that they had",
    "been gone uh",
    "from spring even though we were working",
    "in the spring it's still not",
    "uh being in front of our teachers and",
    "face-to-face instruction",
    "so we felt that we with our resources",
    "with our teachers",
    "and our buildings and our in the space",
    "and our abilities that we could bring",
    "uh our students in so we did put out and",
    "we gave our parents a choice which they",
    "wanted",
    "and i was very proud that we were able",
    "to give them a choice",
    "um about 1200 students chose remote",
    "and we have about 2 600 students that",
    "chose in-school",
    "instruction which actually made it a",
    "little bit nicer we have about",
    "15 or less in each classroom our",
    "students are doing a great job i just i",
    "have to say what a great job and how",
    "proud i am",
    "of not only our students our staff our",
    "parents",
    "and our community our students are doing",
    "an amazing job one of the big things was",
    "they they were worried a lot of the",
    "parents were worried that they couldn't",
    "wear masks",
    "all day long um i will tell you we have",
    "a we started barbington preschool here",
    "about two or three years ago",
    "and our three wearing those masks every",
    "day and they know",
    "they know the six foot distance as well",
    "uh but our",
    "our preschool all the way up to seniors",
    "are doing a great job wearing those",
    "masks",
    "they're doing what is necessary for us",
    "to stay open and we're very proud about",
    "that",
    "the process was amazing we did we did a",
    "lot of uh",
    "planning and preparation in the summer",
    "because we didn't realize or know",
    "which pathway we would take and have to",
    "deliver instruction",
    "so there was a lot of professional",
    "development on the remote part",
    "but luckily we have those people trained",
    "and our remote is going very well too",
    "it's a lot more structured",
    "it's it's the same as a school day they",
    "have periods they check in with their",
    "teachers",
    "and we we actually had meetings with our",
    "teachers and our parents that went",
    "remote",
    "because we felt it was important to get",
    "that personal connection",
    "uh before they start uh because it's",
    "very important barbed and",
    "and i would say most school systems that",
    "personal connection",
    "is extremely important but we understand",
    "that we have to move our students",
    "forward",
    "no matter if they're remote or if",
    "they're in school",
    "and our staff is doing an amazing job",
    "with that",
    "that is great uh one of the things you",
    "and i talked about uh",
    "the other day um in regard to",
    "uh what students do when they're not in",
    "in school",
    "uh one things that we we have seen one",
    "of the",
    "challenges for college students and for",
    "adults and all of us is",
    "you know when we're not into that",
    "routine then",
    "you know what do we do",
    "how's that working out for you and your",
    "messaging to the",
    "students it's it's so far so good we've",
    "had a few bumps in the roads but i have",
    "to say",
    "summer county health department and",
    "tanya burford who i have on speed dial",
    "she's been amazing she's been amazing",
    "and",
    "anytime that there isn't any type of",
    "issues we call her up she helps us",
    "through the process",
    "she's been great and probably most",
    "superintendents with summit county would",
    "say that",
    "but we've really encouraged our parents",
    "they've asked us for the choice",
    "they've asked us to start sports up",
    "this is a big sports town they we're",
    "extremely happy that our magics are out",
    "there",
    "competing so we're asking them to",
    "to stay focused and stick with the plan",
    "and listen to",
    "what the governor's saying and don't go",
    "in large groups",
    "and and be smart because we really truly",
    "want we need to stay open",
    "our students need to be in front of our",
    "teachers again whether it's in school or",
    "remote",
    "and and how about your remote students",
    "uh are you doing this with your own",
    "teachers is that how you're",
    "you're doing that absolutely uh again",
    "our teachers",
    "we didn't know which pathway we would be",
    "taking",
    "come fall so all of our teachers were",
    "training in the summer",
    "but really truly what was nice is we",
    "were actually able to use our teachers",
    "that had concerns about coming back as",
    "well",
    "as our instructors and yes it is barbara",
    "and teachers",
    "marvin and curriculum um and they're",
    "doing a great job",
    "uh we had a little little bump in the",
    "road at the beginning but it's getting",
    "better every day",
    "the communication is amazing we're and",
    "we're really we're trying to",
    "we're also and we appreciate the social",
    "emotional support that the state has",
    "given us",
    "we're trying to incorporate those things",
    "as well remotely",
    "and in person because those wrap around",
    "services",
    "was one of the big things that we were",
    "worried about with our students being",
    "gone from us",
    "for so long for about 22 weeks",
    "well that that's great one last question",
    "for your remote students who",
    "are in let's say lower elementary school",
    "how did how does that",
    "how does that work are these kids able",
    "to",
    "do it does it work oh absolutely yes",
    "they're doing an amazing job",
    "um our teacher but we're a one-to-one",
    "district or we have chromebooks",
    "and we had this beforehand again because",
    "of the great support of our community",
    "so those students have taken those",
    "chromebooks home even our in-school",
    "students take those chromebooks home but",
    "yes our young ones are doing a great job",
    "we're checking in frequently",
    "sometimes if we have to go knock on a",
    "door and see what's going on there or",
    "making sure that they're logging in",
    "we're doing those things as well",
    "but we are actually trying to start",
    "remote tutoring",
    "uh because sometimes there may not be a",
    "parent or a guardian there",
    "while they're working but in the evening",
    "when that parent or guardian comes home",
    "we'll have that remote tutor",
    "available for those students who need",
    "that as well",
    "oh that's that's interesting yeah that's",
    "exciting",
    "yes it is great well good luck to you",
    "and your students and your faculty and",
    "everybody at barberton and",
    "we wish you a great year thank you very",
    "much governor",
    "we appreciate it thank you very much",
    "since we began reopening ohio after the",
    "initial state home order we've listened",
    "to experts",
    "who've told us that being outside is",
    "better when you can be outside",
    "that combined with mask wearing social",
    "distancing",
    "proper hygiene certainly helps us slow",
    "down",
    "covet 19. we've seen ohioans following",
    "the expert advice but we also know that",
    "colder months are coming and so",
    "we thought we'd bring an expert in",
    "joining us today is ohio state",
    "university environmental engineer dr",
    "mark",
    "weir he is the co-director of the",
    "ecology",
    "epidemiology and population health",
    "program at osu infectious disease",
    "institute doctor thank you very very",
    "much for joining us",
    "thanks for having me we we appreciate it",
    "very much",
    "you know we've heard a lot over the last",
    "few days",
    "about aerosolized particles and droplets",
    "and how coca-19 spreads uh on the news",
    "this morning about that and i wonder if",
    "you could maybe just give us a",
    "a one-on-one class that about how that",
    "works",
    "of course um so aerosols in general at",
    "first sound kind of scary",
    "um especially when somebody's talking",
    "about airborne",
    "if somebody says the word airborne",
    "people start to react to that so",
    "um one thing i did i put together a",
    "couple slides that might be able to help",
    "okay we'll look at those sure yeah so if",
    "you go to the first one after the title",
    "um every time that you cough um if",
    "you're",
    "coughing or if you're sneezing you're",
    "obviously expiring out",
    "or expelling out uh droplets and other",
    "particles and those finer smaller",
    "particles that don't drop",
    "out within the the three to six feet",
    "range that we've heard about so much",
    "are the aerosols and so the top image of",
    "those three bars",
    "is the very small particles and they're",
    "going farther afield",
    "and it all depends on the shape of your",
    "mouth when you're talking",
    "how forcefully you're talking how",
    "quietly you're talking",
    "how much you're coughing type of",
    "coughing that you're doing things like",
    "that there's a lot that goes into it but",
    "this happens all the time",
    "and so it's something that we deal with",
    "on the consistent basis so if you look",
    "at the next slide",
    "we have models that we've been putting",
    "together that have been trying to look",
    "at well what are the overall",
    "building and room risks associated with",
    "people",
    "speaking singing talking coughing",
    "sneezing",
    "when they have stars cove 2 or kova 19",
    "or",
    "something else so we built these kind of",
    "models for influenza",
    "mers cove stars so the first sars that",
    "came around",
    "um to be able to try and understand",
    "these every virus is a little different",
    "and",
    "how it forms itself as a or how many",
    "viruses are in those aerosols because",
    "just because it's an aerosol doesn't",
    "mean it's a virus and just because it",
    "has aerosolized a particle that came out",
    "from your mouth",
    "doesn't mean that there's viruses in",
    "those aerosols and so",
    "what you're looking at is a simulation",
    "that we put together with a",
    "great colleague down in south carolina",
    "and dr hope put these together as a way",
    "of being able to say well as we are",
    "increasing our control",
    "such as air exchange rates filtration of",
    "the room",
    "um mixture of air from the outside so",
    "make up air is what we call that what is",
    "actually going to be doing by way of",
    "removing the particles and",
    "it depends on what you can run and how",
    "you can operate it but you can have a",
    "fairly good margin of safety",
    "being able to control the air assault so",
    "you go on last slide",
    "this is really similar to what we've",
    "been talking about this entire time",
    "with regards to the different barriers",
    "and the different levels of control",
    "and so it's basically between the virus",
    "and you are a series of walls that you",
    "can put in place or a series of barriers",
    "that you can put in place",
    "we already know about face masks hand",
    "washing and social distancing",
    "now we're talking about when we're",
    "talking about aerosols",
    "there's engineering options for us at",
    "this point to be able to work through so",
    "while aerosols are a new thing for",
    "for uh for us to be talking about with",
    "regards to source cove too",
    "it is a known quantity from",
    "with regards to ideas of how to control",
    "it",
    "knowledge and technology that we have to",
    "be able to try and control it",
    "now it's at this stage here of",
    "optimizing or or",
    "finessing those controls so that they",
    "can be as effective as possible for this",
    "particular pathogen",
    "and and doctor so so we can understand",
    "uh eric if you go back to the last",
    "actually back two slides",
    "you've got before cough and three",
    "minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes",
    "just make sure i understand this and our",
    "viewers can understand it you've got",
    "something on here that is red you've got",
    "something that's blue what's the",
    "difference and how big a room is it",
    "so that is an average size shared office",
    "space the way we built that one out so",
    "um we didn't put in the cubicle walls",
    "just yet we were just putting in the the",
    "air flows the stocks and flows and",
    "everything",
    "the red is somebody who has a soros cove",
    "to infection",
    "so what you'll end up seeing is that how",
    "that kind of mixes in the environment",
    "but it doesn't end up contaminating the",
    "entire room how",
    "the air flows through the room dictates",
    "where it's going to be able to deposit",
    "on surfaces",
    "who's going to be able to inhale it",
    "later on and where it's going to go into",
    "the",
    "the ventilation system itself okay",
    "we know outside is generally better than",
    "inside",
    "uh and you want to just tell us why that",
    "is maybe it's obvious but",
    "uh just tell us anyway there's i mean",
    "there's a couple pieces to it",
    "um one is that you'll get",
    "much more dynamic air flows when you're",
    "outside so",
    "um deposition and fallout from the",
    "aerosol so that how the aerosols fall",
    "out of the air",
    "typically can occur quite quicker it'll",
    "disperse out into a wider area there's",
    "just",
    "more space for it to be able to go",
    "somewhere there's a",
    "an old wrong saying when you're talking",
    "about pollution which is the solution to",
    "pollution is dilution",
    "while that's not correct for how you",
    "handle environmental pollution",
    "in this case the solution is dilution",
    "where dilution means you take",
    "the same amount of something but put",
    "into a bigger volume and now",
    "you have less ability for you to be able",
    "to inhale it",
    "so that is that is one of the solutions",
    "then it is",
    "and and outdoors is is where you're",
    "going to be able to get the absolute",
    "largest volume",
    "plus you have all the other dynamics of",
    "things like uv exposure",
    "um you just being able to move around in",
    "a in a",
    "larger more basic more random kind of",
    "pattern as well",
    "and and what we tried to do we're",
    "talking about on the indoor side of",
    "things",
    "we've tried to mimic that where we can't",
    "bringing in as much fresh air from the",
    "outdoors removing as much air from",
    "indoors",
    "as possible and so on uh just just so",
    "i'm following here you want to tell me",
    "about",
    "droplets as opposed to the air sliced",
    "particles",
    "what's what's what's what's the",
    "difference if there is a difference",
    "yep so the difference is size",
    "so anything that is within droplet size",
    "range so",
    "about um four microns and up so very",
    "very small particles yeah we're still",
    "talking about very small particles",
    "but they're heavy enough and large",
    "enough that within about",
    "three feet to six feet range is where",
    "they really start to slope down you can",
    "actually see the trajectory going",
    "out and sloping down and they just end",
    "up hitting people's pants or the floor",
    "or somewhere else okay so i'm speaking",
    "right now what would i expect to happen",
    "so you might expect predominantly you",
    "would end up seeing mostly droplets",
    "coming out and then they would fall down",
    "so if you had",
    "a special type of camera that could",
    "actually track the particles coming out",
    "you'd see a bulk of them being droplets",
    "and then you would have a mist of",
    "aerosols that would be able to come out",
    "and",
    "if you are up and projecting your voice",
    "they'll come up a little bit more of an",
    "angle and have a specific cone of",
    "expansion from there okay now",
    "we've read or we've heard this kind of",
    "controversy cdc put",
    "something up on then they take it down",
    "let's put that aside for a moment but",
    "but",
    "what is it that we actually do know what",
    "let's start with what",
    "we know at this point i mean you know",
    "we've continued",
    "to learn scientists have continued to",
    "learn throughout this",
    "let's start with what we what we what we",
    "do know and then what we may think",
    "however you want to explain it",
    "so what we do know is that the virus has",
    "to be able to get to",
    "essentially the back of your throat into",
    "what we call the nasopharyngeal region",
    "so that's where it has to start to",
    "deposit it has to be able to deposit in",
    "the upper respiratory tract",
    "up in that upper portion of your",
    "respiratory system so not your mouth but",
    "back back",
    "where the wind is starting to go in it",
    "goes down into your lungs",
    "that's where it needs to deposit so it",
    "needs to land on that surface",
    "and then it needs to be able to infect",
    "cells that are that make up that portion",
    "of your respiratory system",
    "so we know that now how that gets",
    "delivered",
    "is where the question ends up residing",
    "where",
    "when we were talking about surfaces so",
    "at first surfaces were a",
    "massively dominant component of",
    "transmission so when we say transmission",
    "we mean that the virus has to go from",
    "somewhere in the environment that's",
    "somewhere into you",
    "and the surfaces where",
    "you would touch the surface and then you",
    "would touch your nose or touch your eye",
    "and then you'll be able to get into the",
    "mucous system",
    "and make its way to where it needs to be",
    "that ended up being downgraded in a",
    "level of importance the more we learned",
    "about the droplet spread",
    "the droplet spread is where that three",
    "to six foot range comes in",
    "predominantly three feet and that's",
    "where you're more likely to be able to",
    "get those larger particles actually hit",
    "your face",
    "you can respire those particles um",
    "or they'll be a much more contaminated",
    "area in front of you to drive",
    "surface risks now aerosols are",
    "you're beyond six feet you're beyond",
    "into about 10 feet or so out",
    "and you can still inhale those particles",
    "now what we're talking about is if the",
    "majority of them that come out are",
    "droplets that means that a smaller",
    "amount are going to be aerosols",
    "and it still takes a fairly good amount",
    "of virus for you to be able to inhale",
    "and actually become",
    "sick so we're now we're in that range of",
    "how much is enough to make you sick",
    "when we're talking about aerosols so",
    "that's where a lot of the the back and",
    "forth",
    "and the discussion and research has been",
    "on is how",
    "important are aerosols in exposure we",
    "we've known for a little while that",
    "aerosols are a component but",
    "how important those aerosols are is the",
    "question and that's where cdc",
    "had put something up and then took it",
    "back down for",
    "you'd have to have cdc reasons but um",
    "you know having having worked at epa",
    "you know you want to make sure",
    "everything is right",
    "down to the you know exact thoughts on",
    "eyes and everything else so that could",
    "be what it is as well",
    "so as we look at this",
    "as we head towards the winter and we",
    "look at",
    "public buildings we look at schools we",
    "look at businesses we look at houses",
    "you know what should we be thinking",
    "about",
    "and what are some of the things that we",
    "can do",
    "to deal with it i mean if you talk about",
    "you talked about the droplets",
    "that would seem from what you said to be",
    "basically a function of distance",
    "uh would that be right yes the the",
    "aerosized particles",
    "that's different uh it would seem to be",
    "would that be a matter of circulation uh",
    "based on what would be the variables",
    "there exactly",
    "circulation is one of the key ones and",
    "the first and foremost is to find out",
    "what kind of control you have",
    "over a ventilation system in your home",
    "business",
    "or elsewhere one key very important",
    "thing is that air conditioning and",
    "heating",
    "are not the same as ventilation",
    "ventilation is just focused on moving",
    "the air around",
    "what energy you put in to either heat it",
    "or remove",
    "nor to cool it is the air conditioning",
    "or the heating component",
    "so you may have an ac system it doesn't",
    "mean that you have a ventilation system",
    "so that's one key thing to think about",
    "first",
    "circulation is a great way to think of",
    "it you're moving the air",
    "and it's it's a component of of three",
    "big pieces there's",
    "the air exchange rates how often can you",
    "take all the air in the room and remove",
    "it and replace it with fresh",
    "the makeup air that we call that makeup",
    "bear in",
    "engineering and industrial hygiene is",
    "how much of the outdoor air can i bring",
    "in",
    "that's absolutely fresh doesn't have",
    "source code 2 in it",
    "and then the other one is filtration and",
    "they all work together",
    "and so it is not really so much a",
    "component of",
    "getting as much air out as possible as",
    "often as possible that will have",
    "a beneficial effect but you really need",
    "to look at all three of those",
    "pieces working together for you to be",
    "able to find uh",
    "okay okay i wrote down two i missed one",
    "so you've got",
    "you've got filtration you've got air",
    "exchange ratio",
    "what's the third one um makeup air",
    "so that amount of outdoor air to bring",
    "in okay",
    "you want to go through those quickly for",
    "me sure so the",
    "the makeup bear is where you're talking",
    "about where you don't have the virus",
    "it's outdoor air um so even if there is",
    "a",
    "small amount of virus that's in the",
    "outdoor air is",
    "much much smaller than what would be in",
    "the indoor air and it's typically zero",
    "or at least lower than we can detect it",
    "so that air being brought in is fresh",
    "it's clean you can filter it so be so it",
    "becomes cleaner so you remove allergens",
    "and any other kind of chemicals that are",
    "in it",
    "before it comes into the building and",
    "then you circulate that through the",
    "building then you have to you typically",
    "have to recirculate some of the air for",
    "energy efficiency",
    "reasons as well as humidity controls and",
    "things like that",
    "and that's where air exchange rates come",
    "in as well as filtration they kind of",
    "work hand in hand and that",
    "you can remove a lot of the air and",
    "replace it back into the room",
    "but if you're not filtering it you're",
    "you're just circulating",
    "air from from within the room to another",
    "room or within the same room",
    "and so you know the air exchange rates",
    "is where",
    "think of it where you have the volume of",
    "room that you are in so height",
    "by high times area is your volume take",
    "all of that volume remove it within an",
    "hour",
    "how many times can you do that is your",
    "air changes per hour or your air",
    "exchange rate",
    "and then the filtration is just",
    "filtration so if you've ever seen an",
    "hvac filter",
    "what you're basically doing is just",
    "pushing air through very very small",
    "holes",
    "and it's going to remove the bioaerosols",
    "some of them are small enough to be able",
    "to remove viruses but the majority of",
    "places can remove the bio-aerosols",
    "predominantly that are harboring the",
    "virus",
    "so for our viewers out there let's say",
    "they own a house",
    "let's say it's a 20 year old house",
    "what is from a practical point of view",
    "let's see",
    "let's say that uh you know people are in",
    "and out or let's",
    "even say it's a business let's assume",
    "it's a business and",
    "it's a retail business so they have",
    "people coming in and out",
    "every every single day",
    "what should they do how do they get on",
    "top of this if they want to try to do",
    "something to",
    "improve the situation so",
    "if their business they have a great",
    "opportunity to be able to control the",
    "air in their building",
    "if they have that if they have the",
    "technology bill to do that and",
    "can you know have a very impactful uh",
    "benefit on limiting spread by by",
    "improving the air inside their buildings",
    "um what they want to do is they want to",
    "talk to",
    "whomever it is that they work with as",
    "their licensed",
    "hvac technician or engineer so whoever",
    "they have that comes out that's licensed",
    "that is able to do the maintenance and",
    "operation",
    "updates and preventative maintenance on",
    "their system",
    "have them come out and survey it make",
    "sure they know",
    "what they can actually operate and then",
    "what they can do is work with them and",
    "say well how high of an air change rate",
    "can i have",
    "through what size filter and how much",
    "outdoor air can i bring in",
    "and still be able to operate within a",
    "profitable scheme because you don't want",
    "to go out of business",
    "operating something that's just too",
    "costly so sit down with them make sure",
    "that you have a good plan of how you're",
    "going to be able to go forward with that",
    "the cdc has a great table for clinical",
    "settings but it still works for",
    "other indoor spaces on a number",
    "on different air change rates to be able",
    "to use",
    "so you can always refer to that if you",
    "want",
    "and i'd have to sit down with them make",
    "sure that they are",
    "appropriately licensed and able to be",
    "able to help you with that",
    "and they recommend to talk to a",
    "ventilation engineer see if that works",
    "within your budget and then talk with",
    "them",
    "doctor we're gonna with your help we",
    "hope uh put something up",
    "uh on our web page uh in a short while",
    "uh maybe to give people some better",
    "information but until we get that up",
    "again",
    "what's the best place for them to look",
    "let's say they",
    "they've got a shop or they've got a",
    "house and they want to",
    "go look up what they really need to do",
    "so that they can",
    "intelligently talk to their heating",
    "expert or their",
    "and their air conditioning expert so",
    "great way to start um by taking a dive",
    "into",
    "indoor air is to go to the epa's website",
    "and look for indoor air quality",
    "and that's going to give you a bit of a",
    "crash course into indoor air quality",
    "it's going to be",
    "focused around carbon dioxide build up",
    "for how many you know by respirat was",
    "perspiring how are you contaminating the",
    "room as well as",
    "anything that's volatilizing or um",
    "you know chemicals are coming off of the",
    "desk surfaces and things like that",
    "that's what that page is mostly focused",
    "on",
    "there's a great crash course into what",
    "indoor air quality is",
    "precise definitions of error change air",
    "exchange rate so if",
    "i'm not being clear then you can go",
    "there and they have a great resource",
    "there",
    "from there what you can do is you can",
    "refer to cdc websites now",
    "some of those are clinically oriented",
    "and i think that's one of the things",
    "that we'll be working with you on",
    "making sure that we have a translate you",
    "know translation make sure we understand",
    "how things are moving forward",
    "let's start with the epa and then from",
    "the epa website",
    "contact your hvac license technician",
    "doctor thank you very much we will be uh",
    "we'll be back in touch with you but we",
    "appreciate you coming on today and",
    "giving us a introductory course",
    "thank you thank you",
    "let's move now to learn a little bit",
    "more about",
    "contact tracing we have a contact",
    "tracer who we're going to bring in here",
    "in a moment um",
    "let's let's let's actually go to mitch",
    "mitch you on there",
    "yes hi governor happy to be here mitch",
    "uh",
    "dan duran is the epidemiologist at",
    "lorraine county health department",
    "has been working there for four years i",
    "believe",
    "and uh you're getting a workout in the",
    "last",
    "six months or so it's a little different",
    "world but",
    "can you just for somebody who's watching",
    "this today who has no idea what you do",
    "can you kind of take them through the",
    "process",
    "uh from the beginning you know and then",
    "just kind of",
    "information comes in from the time it",
    "maybe comes into the health department",
    "you take it and you go from there",
    "absolutely",
    "absolutely um yeah certainly did not",
    "expect a pandemic within my first couple",
    "years of",
    "working in a local health department but",
    "you know kent state",
    "got my mindset right and i'm ready for",
    "anything coming out of there so",
    "i can attribute that to them as for",
    "contact tracing",
    "it's pretty straightforward process we",
    "get a notification of a confirmed lab",
    "and our first course of action is to",
    "identify",
    "how we can reach that person a lot of",
    "times that's reported by the lab",
    "and that's a simple phone call and first",
    "and foremost when they do answer the",
    "phone",
    "you want to make sure that they're",
    "medically fit to complete an interview",
    "you don't want to exacerbate",
    "somebody that's already extremely sick",
    "so",
    "some cases have mild symptoms other have",
    "very severe symptoms so we kind of use",
    "our best judgment",
    "to see if that person is medically fit",
    "to to give up the information that we",
    "need",
    "and then from there once they say you",
    "know i'm good we can do this",
    "we are very straightforward with how",
    "what we intend to do with this interview",
    "what we intend to do with the",
    "information that they give us that way",
    "they have it",
    "in their head throughout the interview",
    "of this is why i need to answer these",
    "questions in",
    "a forthcoming manner so once that's all",
    "established",
    "we go right into establishing a time",
    "frame",
    "for this individual in which they were",
    "infectious so",
    "how we do that is we asked when they",
    "first started to feel ill",
    "and what those symptoms were and once we",
    "get that",
    "that date of symptom onset we can",
    "establish",
    "that infectious period and once we have",
    "that time frame we",
    "reiterate to them so okay so we're going",
    "since",
    "september 2nd keep that that that date",
    "in your mind",
    "and as we move forward with this",
    "interview we're going to try to identify",
    "anyone you",
    "exposed and then we go over the",
    "definition of exposure that's very",
    "important",
    "to know what we're looking for them to",
    "know what we're looking for",
    "so once that time frame is established",
    "once that definition is clear in their",
    "head",
    "we move right into it on trying to",
    "figure out",
    "who they may have exposed we start with",
    "the household contacts that's pretty",
    "straightforward",
    "workplace contacts you know when was",
    "your last day at work what did that last",
    "day work look like",
    "is your employer aware do you have any",
    "other cases at work",
    "and then we move on to the community",
    "exposures",
    "those that they may have exposed in a",
    "more casual setting",
    "whether it be through a lunch a family",
    "gathering",
    "churches anything like that so we got",
    "those",
    "three levels of which they could have",
    "exposed anybody um",
    "and then we kind of follow follow up",
    "that interview with a two-week history",
    "this is the more complicated part but um",
    "you know this helps us establish links",
    "with any outbreaks that may be going on",
    "establish a link with a known case that",
    "we have on file",
    "really helps the health department learn",
    "how this is being transmitted throughout",
    "the community",
    "but basically what we tell them when you",
    "say you know when you're going to give",
    "us some information here's exactly what",
    "we're going to do with that information",
    "so those people that come up as",
    "exposures are actually forwarded",
    "down to a different team of ours we have",
    "the interview team that gets that",
    "information and then we have another",
    "team that",
    "reaches out to those that were exposed",
    "and informs of",
    "of their exposure remaining",
    "confidentiality",
    "very important for the case but also it",
    "gives these people a time frame of what",
    "they should be looking at",
    "and the people making these calls to",
    "those that expose",
    "have been are tried and true",
    "professionals they have been",
    "on the front lines of kovitz since march",
    "so",
    "they're experienced with this pandemic",
    "as anybody else in ohio at this point",
    "so we have a really great professional",
    "reaching out to you and letting you know",
    "of all these steps that you should be",
    "taking",
    "for how long and this is what you should",
    "do to protect your family your community",
    "in your workplace",
    "if they want to sign up for a system",
    "where they report",
    "symptoms to us that's easily done",
    "through a text messaging system",
    "developed by the state health department",
    "if",
    "you know that really helps with data",
    "collection it helps us determine on when",
    "it's safe for them to return to work",
    "whether or not they should be tested",
    "so it helps get some information on on",
    "that individual and we can just",
    "consult and guide from there so that's",
    "kind of how the process",
    "works yeah yeah so when you're talking",
    "let's go back to you when you're talking",
    "to the person that",
    "uh has tested positive um and you're now",
    "trying to determine",
    "you know who might they have infected",
    "what's what are some of the variables",
    "the criteria i i mean",
    "um length and time",
    "they're with somebody and i mean how do",
    "you just maybe give us a couple of",
    "examples of",
    "maybe an example of where you you assume",
    "it's not an",
    "infection or and then maybe where you",
    "would assume it was and pass that name",
    "then on",
    "to the next person on your team",
    "absolutely our interviewers are very",
    "experienced",
    "we try to say you know you got to get",
    "the details the details the details on",
    "all of these exposure settings",
    "so that's exactly right the length of",
    "time whether or not there's a mask worn",
    "any direct contact so when we tell them",
    "this is what we're looking for we're",
    "looking for",
    "relative to your symptom onset date so",
    "we got your symptom on set date",
    "let's go three days prior to that that's",
    "when we what we call the pre-symptomatic",
    "phase",
    "and people are spreading it",
    "pre-symptomatically they don't know they",
    "have it",
    "so we're going to go three days from",
    "your symptom onset we're going to define",
    "close contact as",
    "anyone within six feet of you for",
    "15 minutes or longer and then we're",
    "going to get some context behind that",
    "interaction were you",
    "there all day did you make direct",
    "contact did you have a mask and that way",
    "you know if we get in those situations",
    "we're not sure the degree of exposure",
    "the team can talk about it the team can",
    "reach out to the individual",
    "get their side of the story but yeah",
    "basically the definition of close",
    "contact is that six feet",
    "um within that time frame um",
    "with or without a mask so it's it's just",
    "a lot of details behind the exposure",
    "that we we collect and we look at",
    "so every case is kind of fact specific i",
    "guess",
    "exactly and that's why it's tough to",
    "come up with some written protocol",
    "some very black and white directions",
    "we've tried that since the start and",
    "as soon as we do it a case comes and",
    "blows the whole thing to pieces",
    "so that's just kind of the nature of it",
    "you got to be",
    "quick on your feet and",
    "have a team that's willing to consult",
    "with you and and really go over the",
    "information together",
    "and uh the the factor explain to me",
    "uh as a as a professional who's done",
    "this now an awful lot of times",
    "uh explain to me the factor of time",
    "how how long your it might be exposed to",
    "somebody how does that",
    "factor in and what are some of the other",
    "factors",
    "so we use that we use that contact",
    "definition",
    "that was from the state so that that",
    "factor of time now if someone's with",
    "someone all day intermittently it's",
    "really tough to say",
    "cumulatively were you exposed for 15",
    "minutes were you",
    "there for 15 minutes within six feet so",
    "again it's all about those details and",
    "you know what we find is",
    "those that spent the day together and",
    "and try to cut their distance and",
    "everything you know we might not see",
    "really a high-risk situation there but",
    "you know spending someone spending time",
    "in someone's household that's a",
    "different type of",
    "exposure especially if the case lived",
    "there",
    "so those are all the factors that",
    "contribute to that time frame we look at",
    "okay well mitch thank you very very much",
    "good luck",
    "to you and and everyone who else is out",
    "there that's",
    "that's engaged in this we appreciate",

    "today i understand that you'd face",

    "vandalia where you were was unlike",
    "anything that we'd seen for months of",
    "course you both attended and that event",
    "seemed to break all the guidance that",
    "you've given ohioans",
    "for months lieutenant governor houston",
    "he was encouraging a mostly masculist",
    "crowd to cheer taboo",
    "breathing a lot of those aerosols and",
    "droplets that we just heard about into a",
    "partially indoor setting so given all",
    "the prior",
    "guidance to this um is there a defense",
    "or a reason for it",
    "well i'll i'll start um look we've made",
    "it very clear",
    "that if you're exercising your first",
    "amendment rights",
    "we're not going to have a health order",
    "um",
    "that prohibits you from exercising your",
    "first amendment rights we said the same",
    "thing to demonstrators",
    "demonstrators on anything demonstrators",
    "who demonstrated against the health",
    "director",
    "dr acton demonstrators who demonstrate",
    "against me",
    "demonstrators who came out out to our",
    "house and",
    "went by and honk their horns and do",
    "their things",
    "look so but we've also said been very",
    "very clear",
    "whether it's demonstrators whether it's",
    "people at a trump rally or people at any",
    "other political rally",
    "you know please wear a mask uh that is",
    "how you stay safe that is how you slow",
    "this spread down",
    "um we have been consistent uh about this",
    "mask of guidance that we have given",
    "and so you know they did not follow that",
    "uh some did uh many did not uh",
    "and i think that's that's too bad that",
    "they they did not do that",
    "but our you know we're gonna be",
    "consistent uh in regard to the first",
    "amendment uh we did the same thing with",
    "churches",
    "uh you know we've said people need to",
    "wear a mask in church but we've",
    "we never the height of this ever shut",
    "our churches down",
    "many churches pulled back and said we're",
    "going to be remote",
    "we're going to do that but we never",
    "unlike other states we've never issued",
    "an order that",
    "closed the churches we've not in any way",
    "really prohibited the first amendment",
    "exercise",
    "but we have asked people please please",
    "be careful sometimes they listen to us",
    "sometimes they don't",
    "yeah uh look during the during the whole",
    "process",
    "uh i mean much to my own peril",
    "i tried to encourage people to to wear",
    "masks",
    "uh i held up masks uh encouraged people",
    "to do it when they went out",
    "and i wore a mask at the event other",
    "than when i was speaking which was",
    "outside and",
    "and i was very very much distance from",
    "anybody in",
    "in the crowd but we've been very",
    "consistent about it and",
    "like i said you know folks uh",
    "folks want to wear their trump masks",
    "they want to wear their biden masks that",
    "they can wear whatever mask they want",
    "but they should they should do it",
    "because it works and",
    "and uh we're seeing the results i mean",
    "look the people of this state have been",
    "pretty good",
    "all all around during this and now we're",
    "seeing",
    "during a difficult time when schools",
    "went back when colleges have gone back",
    "when",
    "sports are going on that if you follow",
    "the rules outside of those settings",
    "with masks and distancing that can work",
    "and we see the positivity rate",
    "down to below three percent now which is",
    "which is great news",
    "uh the people of this state are making",
    "this work",
    "uh it's it's not perfect yesterday",
    "certainly wasn't",
    "but by and large people of ohio getting",
    "it right and",
    "you know i tried to set a good example",
    "um in what i did",
    "i do a health call with a call",
    "uh in the morning once a week with our",
    "health directors around the state and um",
    "it's it's fascinating because they kind",
    "of give me a report",
    "and we went through a number of them i",
    "think we had 120 on",
    "uh this morning something like that from",
    "different different counties different",
    "departments",
    "and the report as far as what mask",
    "wearing was good",
    "uh there are a couple outliers a couple",
    "ones who said no we're only at 50.",
    "um but the majority of the people who",
    "talked today",
    "on the call said hey we're doing better",
    "it continues to edge up",
    "um so look ohioans i think by and large",
    "are doing very very well",
    "and we're that's made a difference i",
    "mean this positivity would not be what",
    "it is today",
    "um you know we would not have slowed",
    "this this increase",
    "uh and going down really to a plateau",
    "and maybe a little bit down a number of",
    "cases",
    "uh without people wearing masks it has",
    "made a fundamental difference",
    "and so while we look at sometimes when",
    "there's examples of people not doing it",
    "we should also look at",
    "all the other examples that people are",
    "are doing it or fran and i were today at",
    "church funeral service",
    "a lot of people there everybody had had",
    "a mask on everyone was trying to",
    "distance",
    "people were being very very careful and",
    "that matters",
    "next question is from emily hamilton at",
    "wews",
    "in cleveland",

    "you know we had had the opportunity to",
    "take a look at that",
    "at that individual i said the same thing",
    "with district court judges and circuit",

    "how we're fighting the covet",
    "uh how we're bringing jobs back back to",
    "ohio and i'm gonna",
    "i'm gonna stay focused on on that",
    "um you know as far as whether i think",
    "there should be a vote",
    "uh if i was in the senate um you know i",
    "would uh",
    "when that nomination came up and when it",
    "had been into the judiciary",
    "committee uh if i was still on the",
    "judiciary judiciary committee i would",
    "have",
    "done the due diligence that we did and i",
    "would have voted",
    "next question is from kevin landers at",
    "wbns",
    "in columbus hello governor",
    "hi kevin you mentioned the winter is",
    "coming uh",
    "flu and covid are going to smash into",
    "each other",
    "when flu season begins people are going",
    "to have symptoms",
    "um and they won't know whether they have",
    "covet or whether they have the flu",
    "how concerned are you about whether or",
    "not the state has enough tests",
    "to treat everybody who will then be",
    "wanting to know if they have covet 19",
    "or they or",
    "well our team is working on that",
    "hospitals are working on health",
    "professionals are working on it so i",
    "have confidence that we will be able to",
    "do that um",
    "you know again to back up this wasn't",
    "exactly your question",
    "but i would urge people to get their flu",
    "shot you can get it now you know get a",
    "flu shot",
    "you don't what the health experts say is",
    "you don't want covet and the flu at the",
    "same time",
    "you know we don't know what that would",
    "be but we certainly don't want to uh",
    "roll the dice on that so so get the flu",
    "shot",
    "uh flu shot you know cuts down your",
    "chance of getting getting flu but also",
    "your chance if you do get it the",
    "severity of it so it clearly",
    "is in everyone's interest",
    "to get a flu shot we urge people to",
    "really focus",
    "on children as well uh get your own flu",
    "shot get your",
    "children's flu shot if you look at the",
    "danger areas it's",
    "it's the real danger areas it's",
    "early in in a person's life later in the",
    "person's life",
    "uh your mortality rate is up uh in",
    "regard to flu and we do lose flu",
    "as as many of our critics have pointed",
    "out hey we lose a lot of people in flu",
    "every year yes we do but we don't want",
    "to lose them",
    "and so we hope that they're wearing a",
    "mask which we",
    "we know many of the same mitigating",
    "things",
    "to to fight back the covet are things",
    "that you can",
    "use to fight back the flu they're not",
    "inconsistent in fact they're entirely",
    "consistent",
    "and so we just urge people get a flu",
    "shot continue to wear the mask",
    "and that's our best chance of fighting",
    "this back",
    "what will happen we don't know we've",
    "seen some countries in the southern",
    "hemisphere who've had winter",
    "and they've done pretty well with the",
    "virus and they attribute that to the",
    "wearing of the mass",
    "so again let's hope get the flu shot or",
    "but people wear a mask",
    "we can get the number of flu incidents",
    "down and the severity down as well",
    "next question is from danny eldridge at",
    "hannah news service",

    "our team did that hey there's a problem",
    "there's some people who had clicked who",
    "were not didn't get it they went back",
    "examined it the data that i or the",
    "statistics i just",
    "gave a few minutes ago what they found",
    "out um",
    "you know as soon as we found out i said",
    "okay just you know get those",
    "applications in the mail and they did",
    "that",
    "uh those all went out about a week ago",
    "and people should have received them by",

    "and so we would urge people now that",
    "you're focused on the election to",
    "uh to go ahead and to fill those out if",

    "you're not registered",
    "plenty of opportunity to get registered",

    "elections and get registered",
    "next question is from max philby at the",
    "columbus dispatch",
    "hey governor um so data from the cdc",
    "shows that this year alone more",
    "alzheimer's and dementia",
    "patients um are dying which is often",
    "cited as a result of covet 19",
    "unfortunately",
    "but several have also cited the facts",
    "that many of these people",
    "who are in memory care facilities have",
    "not been able to see loved ones and",
    "and friends and family and given what",
    "you were talking about today with the",
    "ventilation systems and whatnot moving",
    "toward winter",
    "how do you preserve those kinds of",
    "visitation and whatnot",
    "as we move toward winter",
    "well these are the these are the tough",
    "gut-wrenching decisions",
    "that we all have to make i have to make",
    "as governor but families have to make",
    "and",
    "people running nursing homes have to",
    "make",
    "you know initially we closed the nursing",
    "homes to visitors",
    "that was the recommendation of every",
    "health expert that we talked to",
    "after a few months it became evident",
    "that there were people in nursing homes",
    "certainly",
    "among those alzheimer's patients who",
    "were not doing well and maybe one of the",
    "reasons they were not doing well",
    "was because they've been cut off from",
    "their loved ones",
    "uh so we looked at that and said okay",
    "how can we how can we deal with this but",
    "virus is still here what's the balance",
    "and so what we came up with is",
    "visitation outside and",
    "that's been going on since i believe",
    "july",
    "we are a little concerned that sometimes",
    "we hear that that",
    "nursing homes are not carrying out",
    "outside visitation",
    "and you know we kind of question that",
    "and sometimes if someone contacts us or",
    "our",
    "aging omnibus person uh you know they",
    "will find out from the nursing on what",
    "what is going on",
    "uh but that's been going on this outside",
    "visitation",
    "now we've got to balance you know how do",
    "we have indoor visitation",
    "but do everything that we can to protect",
    "the people in the nursing home the",
    "residents who live in the nursing home",
    "and we will have that announcement",
    "sometime within the next week or so you",
    "know how we're going to roll out that",
    "visitation but again",
    "in light of the discussion we had today",
    "one of the things that we asked nursing",
    "homes to do is to take a",
    "take a look at their their whole",
    "filtration system the ventilation system",
    "uh and take another look at that that's",
    "important",
    "um we also will be",
    "getting as we move forward we're going",
    "to have more",
    "uh more quicker tests and more cheaper",
    "tests",
    "and i think it's certainly another layer",
    "of protection",
    "certainly could be we're not there yet",
    "but it could be in the future",
    "if someone if you want to come in and",
    "visit that you take a test",
    "15 minutes later if you clear it then",
    "you then you go in",
    "now we're not there yet uh but that's",
    "these",
    "these are on the market we just don't",
    "have the availability yet so",
    "um in answer your question we go about",
    "it very carefully",
    "we we try to be careful we are careful",
    "uh but we also",
    "understand that by not letting someone",
    "in",
    "that's also has a could have a very",
    "detrimental effect",
    "on the resin of the nursing home as well",
    "so these are just these are tough",
    "as i said this is some of the most",
    "gut-wrenching decisions that",
    "that are made because there's no there's",
    "no good and there's no easy answer",
    "next question is from jesse ballmert at",
    "the cincinnati enquirer",
    "hello governor uh yesterday",
    "yesterday uh president trump said that",
    "covet 19 affects virtually nobody",
    "under the age of 18. so i guess my",
    "questions are",
    "is that accurate based on just you're",
    "looking at the data in ohio",
    "and how how does that jive with your",
    "warnings toward",
    "to young people well i didn't hear the i",
    "didn't hear the president say that i'll",
    "take your word for it but i'll just",
    "comment on from a medical",
    "point of view and look what we do every",
    "day is we talk to the best medical",
    "people that we can find",
    "that includes the white house uh people",
    "i was on a call yesterday",
    "with the vice president the number of",
    "the white house medical advisors and",
    "other",
    "other other individuals um so we know",
    "that someone under 18 can get copin",
    "uh we know uh i'll try to do a quick",
    "quick summary we know they can get it",
    "we know they can pass it they can spread",
    "it we also know",
    "that at that age many times they don't",
    "show the symptoms",
    "many times if they do show symptoms",
    "they're not",
    "very serious symptoms but we also know",
    "that",
    "that people teenagers for example can",
    "get pretty sick",
    "and we also worry about you know what is",
    "the long-term damage that we don't the",
    "medical experts",
    "really don't know i mean i've cited the",
    "figures",
    "at ohio state and this was a small small",
    "number of people",
    "but early on in their testing of",
    "athletes",
    "what they found was that it was 13",
    "of those athletes who tested positive",
    "had",
    "this this i can't remember the exact",
    "name but it's a microcardio",
    "uh it is some problem in regard to",
    "inflammation the heart uh in those cases",
    "in each one of those cases at ohio state",
    "there was not a",
    "serious problem but the point was it",
    "needs",
    "that person would need to be cleared if",
    "they're going to be you know play",
    "competitive",
    "athletics or if they're even going to go",
    "out and just you know",
    "and run so you know we've tried to",
    "uh in these uh two o'clock uh sessions",
    "bring you the best medical advice we can",
    "uh we don't claim",
    "uh we have any corner on the best",
    "medical advice but we try to bring this",
    "in",
    "and and talk about this um so",
    "that's that's the summary of what i know",
    "next question is from jack windsor at",
    "wmfd",
    "in mansfield hey jack hello governor",
    "hi sir uh since the high point of 81",
    "percent in april",
    "your approval rating for handling covet",
    "has seen the sixth biggest drop in the",
    "country",
    "as of late august as low as 53 percent",
    "improving",
    "and it seems to continue to drop",
    "yesterday",
    "lieutenant governor was booed a couple",
    "times warming up for president trump",
    "who later announced your name to a",
    "chorus of booze",
    "obviously this isn't a popularity",
    "contest but given the large number of",
    "ohioans who oppose",
    "your direction the number of judges who",
    "have called orders illegal",
    "and then the most recent announcement uh",
    "by a republican representative of a bill",
    "that seeks to strike down the state of",
    "emergency",
    "as in any war have you begun to define",
    "an exit strategy",
    "because you continue to say that ohio is",
    "open but businesses are operating at",
    "less than 50 percent",
    "and many will not survive taking health",
    "insurance and health security away from",
    "thousands of ohioans",
    "so since your oath of office compels you",
    "to protect our constitutional liberties",
    "not make sure people don't get sick what",
    "is the metric not the emotion but the",
    "metric that will cause you to listen",
    "to the growing number number of people",
    "who are asking you to change directions",
    "well",
    "well well well jack as we would say in",
    "debate uh",
    "just because i don't answer every one of",
    "your questions doesn't mean i accept the",
    "facts",
    "um you know businesses for example",
    "yes we control the hours of bars the",
    "state always controls that and they're",
    "less",
    "but a lot of businesses are fully open",
    "um",
    "you know as far as what the state has",
    "has ordered but",
    "uh let me talk for a moment uh",
    "about uh yesterday and the president uh",
    "being there and the",
    "lieutenant governor was there and he as",
    "you all saw he",
    "made some comments about uh uh worm mask",
    "and that didn't go too well some booze",
    "and then the",
    "comments about me and then the president",
    "had some nice things to say about me",
    "you know you know i had a nice chance to",
    "talk on the on the",
    "airplane for a little while along with",
    "members of the congressional delegation",
    "uh but he had some nice things to say",
    "but uh then that did elicit some booze",
    "out there and so",
    "look booing is a uh",
    "first amendment right uh whether you're",
    "at the ballpark or wherever you are at a",
    "political rally",
    "or out protesting somewhere",
    "uh it is a pure first amendment uh right",
    "that",
    "uh that we we fully uh accept",
    "i was kind of reminded uh yesterday when",
    "fran and i left",
    "uh the president's speech and as we're",
    "coming back",
    "back to cedarville i was reminded of",
    "something i observed in the united",
    "states senate with my friend jim bunning",
    "jim bunning",
    "of course was a major league baseball",
    "player",
    "hall of famer great guy and he also",
    "served in the united states senate",
    "and he was in the united states senate",
    "he and i coincided uh",
    "some of our time together overlapped in",
    "the united states",
    "senate i remember one time um",
    "we had was we're having a luncheon of",
    "senate republicans",
    "and uh they're kind of freewheeling and",
    "uh you know there's no press there and",
    "people are saying what they think",
    "uh pretty bluntly uh sometimes and uh",
    "jim got up and he was talking about",
    "something i don't know what it was",
    "but somebody else got up and they were",
    "giving him a hard time",
    "and uh jim looked at this person then",
    "kind of looked all the all the all the",
    "senators and he said you know",
    "guys you just go ahead i'm not worried",
    "about you he said i've uh",
    "i've been booed by thirty thousand",

    "not a baseball player not a not an",
    "all-star not a member of the hall of",
    "fame",
    "but i i sort of feel that's that same",
    "way",
    "in regard to booing uh people have every",
    "right to boo",
    "uh i've been picketed in the past uh",
    "i've been booed in the past and so",
    "look these are in all seriousness these",
    "are tough decisions",
    "and uh people of goodwill uh",
    "can have very very different uh opinions",
    "about",
    "where the state should go uh how we",
    "should deal with the coveted virus",
    "and even serious you know differences",
    "about",
    "how serious it is uh but every decision",
    "we've made has been based on the best",
    "medical science we can",
    "get i'm going to continue to make the",
    "decisions",
    "that are appropriate i'm going to",
    "continue to work with the state",
    "legislature",

    "people that i'm around when they wear it",
    "they're protecting me",
    "uh it's just a simple sign of of",
    "how we should care about each other and",
    "i know that not everybody embraces that",
    "and i respect that but you know we've",
    "had success because we've been able",
    "to to convince most people and most",
    "people have",
    "uh are following the rules and and doing",
    "that and",
    "it's not it's not like we want to tell",
    "people what to do",
    "uh frankly this is a this allows us to",
    "open things up these are symbols of",
    "freedom",
    "in the sense that when you do it you",
    "control the virus and more good things",
    "get to happen and",
    "and um you know it uh i know from time",

    "from the from the dispatch",
    "about um nursing home visitations one of",
    "our wcpo viewers recently reached out",
    "voicing her own concerns about",
    "visitation limits",
    "um showing her frustration that even",
    "though nursing homes are allowed to have",
    "some visitors inside",
    "the state's guidance is still fairly",
    "strict which",
    "our viewer says limits what nursing",
    "homes are willing to allow",
    "so i just want to clarify you mentioned",
    "that we'll have some new information",
    "available next week",
    "are you able to say if that information",
    "will include changes to the current",
    "recommendations regarding visitation and",
    "um",
    "and how hands-on your administration",
    "would be in helping facility",
    "facilities adapt to these changes",
    "well ben yes i mean we're going to allow",
    "some visitation inside as we get into",
    "cold weather",
    "uh director mcelroy uh",
    "was working this morning on this you",
    "know i had a conversation this morning",
    "about it we might have this guidance by",
    "thursday",
    "uh maybe by tuesday and you know",
    "while we have opened the nursing homes",
    "up",
    "we have not compelled the nursing homes",
    "to do it uh because sometimes there are",
    "facts",
    "things that are going on in the nursing",
    "home uh",
    "that we don't know about and so we've",
    "not gone in with a heavy hand in doing",
    "that",
    "um but our our request in nursing homes",
    "is you know they",
    "they do allow the visitation you know if",
    "they've got kova they're spread in the",
    "nursing home obviously you're not going",
    "to do it if they've got",
    "other you know problems or reasons not",
    "to do it uh",
    "you know we would ask them to allow a",
    "reasonable period of time for the for",
    "that",
    "for that visitation but again these are",
    "just tough these are just balancing",
    "um you know the equities and",
    "and the needs and and people in nursing",
    "homes have",
    "the residents have needs families have",
    "needs",
    "we also want to keep them safe and we",
    "want to do what we can",
    "to reduce the chances of the covet",
    "coming into the nursing home",
    "so we we continue continue down that",
    "path",
    "um we'll wrap up uh here",
    "we have a video from a singing group",
    "see if i can get the pronunciation right",
    "capricio",
