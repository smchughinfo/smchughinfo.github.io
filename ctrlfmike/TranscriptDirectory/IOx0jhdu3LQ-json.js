    "our first confirmed case of cobia 19",
    "at our ohio veterans home in georgetown",
    "brown county an employee has been tested",
    "positive",
    "the how department of veterans services",
    "had been able to keep the",
    "chronovirus out of this nursing home all",
    "this time",
    "since the start of the pandemic but",
    "sadly we are seeing",
    "more community spread in our rural",
    "counties and certainly brown county has",
    "significant community spread is one of",
    "the",
    "12 counties uh you know red level 3",
    "public emergency",
    "this week the employee has not been at",
    "work since thursday morning but it",
    "appears that at least two other",
    "employees",
    "may have been exposed to this individual",
    "this has triggered veterans services to",
    "put additional safety measures in place",
    "at the home and they're tracking all",
    "potential",
    "exposures because we've been testing",
    "staff in georgetown regularly",
    "all staff had already been scheduled to",
    "be tested yesterday",
    "and today and that is taking place",
    "additionally all residents in the unit",
    "where this employee works are being",
    "tested as are the residents in the two",
    "other units where the potentially",
    "exposed employees",
    "are assigned as we do each",
    "day we will continue updating any change",
    "in case numbers at ohio's two veterans",
    "home on our website",
    "chronovirus.ohio.gov",
    "so today we're going to talk about",
    "sports",
    "i know a much anticipated subject",
    "by many people throughout the state",
    "um i thought we would talk first talk",
    "with dr jim borchers dr borchers",
    "has had extensive experience",
    "in working in this particular area uh at",
    "ohio state university",
    "and uh doctor are you on here yet",
    "eric is he is he here i am here",
    "what's up doctor thank you so very very",
    "much for",
    "joining us and i know you've worked with",
    "athletes at ohio state",
    "and i wonder maybe if you could just",
    "kind of start off by telling us what",
    "what you have learned i mean i know that",
    "we continue",
    "uh the medical community continues to",
    "learn more as we move forward with covet",
    "and",
    "have more experiences and it's an",
    "evolving situation and",
    "maybe just kind of share with us some of",
    "the things that that that you have seen",
    "uh in your work uh at ohio state in",
    "general and your work with",
    "with the athletes well governor thanks",
    "for having me today and",
    "uh very happy to be here you know our",
    "uh experiences uh allowed us really to",
    "study the effect of covet and",
    "and its effects uh not only on athletics",
    "but on sport and participation and i",
    "think",
    "probably the first thing that we've",
    "learned is that uh",
    "the health of the community around our",
    "athletes is",
    "utmost importance to our athletes being",
    "able to compete",
    "when we are able to provide our athletes",
    "with a healthy environment",
    "and are able to have them follow the",
    "basic behaviors that",
    "we've all been asked to follow around",
    "this virus which is appropriate",
    "social distancing and",
    "good hygiene face mask and following",
    "proper procedures",
    "in and around the sport facilities and",
    "around conducting athletics",
    "um that that makes a makes a large",
    "difference for us",
    "when the community does not have a",
    "healthy environment when we see a large",
    "infectivity rate",
    "we have found that uh it's more",
    "difficult",
    "and we struggle sometimes to have uh",
    "athletics and sport and organize sports",
    "so i think that is probably first and",
    "foremost the most",
    "important thing and i think the second",
    "thing we've",
    "you know known and i think everyone",
    "knows is just how important athletics",
    "and sport is to our mental health and",
    "well-being and uh",
    "how important it is that we all join in",
    "together to allow sports to occur",
    "well that's great and doctor i apologize",
    "i kind of rushed into this i was",
    "anxious to hear from you i didn't really",
    "give you the the proper introduction but",
    "let me just do it uh for everyone uh",
    "dr portrait specializes in sports",
    "medicine at the wexner medical center",
    "uh he's some first-hand experience as a",
    "former ohio state football",
    "player from 1989 to 1993 will give your",
    "age away i guess there doctor",
    "there you go it was inspired to be a",
    "doctor in part by his physicians who",
    "cared for him when he was a student",
    "athlete so doctor thank you very very",
    "much",
    "we have heard dr um",
    "one of the things that is in the order",
    "that we're",
    "putting out today talks about",
    "myocarditis",
    "but also sudden cardiac arrest which i",
    "know",
    "has been something that i think people",
    "have been concerned about for a long",
    "time",
    "i remember years ago having",
    "seen that tragedy reported one night for",
    "a ud basketball player",
    "i have a good friend of mine",
    "from congress whose son died",
    "at a very very young age playing playing",
    "college basketball",
    "uh from from that so maybe you could",
    "start with that",
    "and then talk how those two are maybe or",
    "are related or not related but",
    "just some things that uh coaches and and",
    "athletic directors and",
    "and everyone else connected with sports",
    "maybe should",
    "maybe should think about sure well i",
    "think",
    "as you mentioned sudden cardiac death in",
    "athletes is a tragic event",
    "and it fortunately is a very rare event",
    "it's not",
    "something that's common but something",
    "that we almost always hear some",
    "reports of and really requires vigilance",
    "on preparation so all our great athletic",
    "trainers around the state of ohio that",
    "are",
    "providing excellent emergency care",
    "our cpr training and the use of a",
    "automated external defibrillator are",
    "really the ways that we can",
    "you know save lives and so even more",
    "important than screening is our",
    "preparation and so",
    "obviously i know our coaches athletic",
    "trainers medical staffs administrators",
    "around the state really take a lot of",
    "great pride and have",
    "done a great job at instituting that",
    "that being said we know one of the risk",
    "factors for sudden cardiac death is",
    "infection of the heart or what you've",
    "mentioned myocarditis and",
    "although not the most common cause can",
    "be a cause of sudden cardiac death and",
    "arrhythmia",
    "certainly in athletes and one of the",
    "things that we continue to study and",
    "look at with",
    "covet 19 is its predilection",
    "for potentially affecting the heart with",
    "infection and so",
    "it's one of the issues that has been",
    "discussed quite a bit it's one of the",
    "issues that we're learning quite a bit",
    "about",
    "and certainly that we want to remain",
    "vigilant for but i think it highlights",
    "the need for again",
    "prevention for healthy communities and",
    "trying to allow",
    "you know rather than worrying about what",
    "we do when that occurs which is a rare",
    "event",
    "how can we prevent it from occurring and",
    "i think those are those things that",
    "you and others have talked about in",
    "trying to allow our athletes to",
    "compete in a healthy environment so",
    "let's talk for a moment of say",
    "an athlete who has the symptoms of covid",
    "um let's just assume they're they're",
    "tested",
    "comes back positive athlete does not",
    "exhibit you know any kind of major",
    "problem never has to go to the hospital",
    "for example",
    "that person's now hopes to come back and",
    "play what",
    "you're the doctor what do you advise the",
    "the coach what do you advise the parents",
    "what do you advise the athlete",
    "yeah i think what i would advise",
    "everyone governor is that that athlete",
    "if they've been coveted positive meets",
    "with their health care",
    "provider and makes certain that they",
    "have discussed you know the health risks",
    "and that they've had a complete",
    "assessment",
    "before they return to sport and that may",
    "then you know be different for each",
    "uh individual and so certainly that",
    "could involve",
    "uh not only an exam but other cardiac",
    "testing ekgs echocardiograms you know",
    "um lab work other specialized cardiac",
    "tests and the",
    "use of a cardiac specialist if needed",
    "but i think",
    "anyone who's had been coveted positive",
    "needs to meet with their health care",
    "provider or seek out that advice",
    "before they return to activity to make",
    "certain that they understand also the",
    "signs and symptoms to watch out for",
    "shortness of breath any chest discomfort",
    "exercise fatigue you know",
    "a middle-aged runner who maybe used to",
    "be able to run a eight-minute mile",
    "that's now only able to run 12 or 13",
    "minute miles these are the things that",
    "might alert our health care providers to",
    "looking at something more specific so",
    "not that we need to be",
    "i think overly scared of this",
    "complication but we need to be aware of",
    "it okay",
    "very very good i asked you this morning",
    "uh a question um",
    "i said if you had a child who",
    "was wanting to play contact sports this",
    "fall",
    "uh would you let them do it yeah you did",
    "ask me that",
    "question and i've been asked that",
    "question quite a bit and i have uh",
    "two high school age boys who play sports",
    "a daughter who was a very competitive",
    "athlete and and my response to you is",
    "the response i'm gonna give now and that",
    "i think that every individual needs to",
    "look at what's going on in their",
    "environment and kind of what their",
    "community looks like if the infectivity",
    "rate of this virus is",
    "extremely high and and we don't have the",
    "ability to test i'd have some real",
    "concerns about letting my son",
    "play a contact sport that being said if",
    "i lived in a community where the",
    "infectivity rate is well controlled",
    "where it's low where",
    "i felt like our community had embraced",
    "the guidelines to allow the athletes to",
    "compete in a healthy manner then i would",
    "you know feel better about letting my",
    "son go forward so i think it",
    "you have to take into account what's",
    "going on in your local community what's",
    "going on in your",
    "you know more extended community and i",
    "think that's why it's so incumbent on",
    "all of us to",
    "to you know do the best we can to",
    "prevent",
    "as much spread as possible okay good",
    "doctor thank you very very much one",
    "maybe one last last question",
    "um in regard to let's",
    "a situation where um",
    "one of the athletes on a team comes down",
    "with covenants confirmed that student",
    "has covered what does that mean for the",
    "other athletes on that team or what",
    "might it mean",
    "yes it's fact i assume it's fact driven",
    "pretty much here but what what might",
    "that mean or",
    "what what should happen sure so i think",
    "i think first and foremost we want to",
    "share information to prevent the",
    "you know unnecessary spread of that so",
    "we want to make certain that",
    "um that we make aware those aware that",
    "there could be a positive",
    "case and then i think that's where",
    "contact tracing is we've",
    "heard a lot about become so important",
    "that we don't have an unnecessary",
    "shutdown so to speak of a large group of",
    "people that we have the ability",
    "to make certain that those close",
    "contacts are appropriately",
    "notified and follow cdc guidance and",
    "others on self quarantine",
    "the inability to do that or the",
    "inability to provide that information is",
    "probably going to lead to health",
    "departments",
    "recommending that entire groups of",
    "people entire teams or even entire",
    "leagues potentially not participate for",
    "a period of time and that can be really",
    "disruptive to sport",
    "so certainly that sort of communication",
    "is going to be really important and",
    "something that we need to be",
    "very vigilant about great doctor thank",
    "you very very much",
    "we appreciate you being with us thank",
    "you thank you",
    "eric let's go to our uh quickly to our",
    "our slides here",
    "eric is behind the camera trying to do a",
    "bunch of different things",
    "at one time this is our regular slide",
    "that comes up",
    "um as we'll see the cases we certainly",
    "like we don't like see any cases but",
    "that number is better than some of the",
    "numbers we've been seeing 861",
    "deaths tragically 39 people",
    "hospitalizations we see also are up",
    "uh and icu admissions are are up",
    "uh eric if we could go to the latest",
    "version of our top 10 ohio counties",
    "ranked by incidents",
    "these are i believe new numbers let me",
    "look at the dates here",
    "yeah this this goes up to today uh we'll",
    "see that",
    "and these are again counties",
    "where we're trying to compare based on",
    "population so",
    "how much has been spread what are the",
    "number of cases in the last",
    "14 days based on population so it's",
    "last last 14 days per 100 000 population",
    "mercer county is at 2 45 still number",
    "one although",
    "down a little bit dark county lawrence",
    "county",
    "meigs county preble shelby sandusky",
    "perry champaign all glaze",
    "so for the first time the top 10",
    "counties are are basically rural",
    "counties",
    "and this is what we continue to see we",
    "continue to see this significant spread",
    "out into our rural areas",
    "so it is obviously very very concerning",
    "we do have good news the positivity",
    "overall statewide",
    "is is coming down and we're happy",
    "happy about that and we're also seeing",
    "in our urban areas",
    "uh generally a lowering uh in the number",
    "number of cases and so that is",
    "that is good so",
    "we will be issuing an order and best",
    "guidance in regard to",
    "sports this is really the best",
    "guidance that can be provided by the",
    "health experts and the medical",
    "experts but the caveat always is that",
    "like anything else in life it depends on",
    "how it is executed",
    "so we would just ask people when this",
    "comes out in the next within the next",
    "day",
    "just take a look at it kind of go",
    "through it",
    "but let me give you the give you the",
    "highlights",
    "so we will be releasing this order and",
    "really it's about how",
    "we can provide the best advice",
    "to how sports in ohio are conducted",
    "this includes not only high school",
    "athletes not only situations that are",
    "under the ohio",
    "high school athletic association's",
    "umbrella",
    "but any kind of sports and organized by",
    "basically anybody",
    "uh in the state so it applies to all",
    "athletes all teams",
    "whether under this umbrella the ohio",
    "high school",
    "athletic association or or not",
    "we have certainly heard from parents",
    "we've heard from athletes",
    "we've talked young people coaches",
    "doctors",
    "and and health experts",
    "just maybe kind of a few",
    "thoughts about this and kind of our",
    "thinking process",
    "we know first of all that just as going",
    "back to school in person",
    "does increase the risk of spread we know",
    "that",
    "sports do particularly contact",
    "sports they do as well uh further we",
    "know",
    "that as dr borcher said",
    "uh several times the more spread there",
    "is",
    "in a community um the more spread",
    "there's going to be in the school",
    "and the higher risk there's going to be",
    "to the students and certainly to the",
    "athletes as well",
    "on the other hand we all know the",
    "importance of sports",
    "we've seen that fran and i have seen",
    "that with with our own children",
    "we've seen it with our own grandchildren",
    "sports matters it makes a difference",
    "sports provides all the things that we",
    "know discipline",
    "brings order structure in the lives of",
    "student athletes",
    "and certainly brings joy to those",
    "athletes and",
    "certainly to their families as well",
    "uh any decision about playing sports or",
    "not playing sports",
    "simply cannot be made in a vacuum uh",
    "that",
    "young person if they're not playing",
    "sports will obviously be doing",
    "something else with their time",
    "and that has to be kept in mind as well",
    "we also know of course that each young",
    "person is different",
    "each young person has different needs",
    "each young person is a different point",
    "in their life with different",
    "different needs different situations",
    "again our order provides what we hope is",
    "the best guidance",
    "to play sports as safely as that can be",
    "played",
    "in the era of kogan 19.",
    "so our order will provide that all",
    "sports",
    "may go forward uh this fall with contact",
    "and the non-contact sports",
    "again we lay out exactly the roadmap",
    "and how this should take place and what",
    "has to be done to make it as safe as",
    "as possible we also though have heard",
    "from superintendents",
    "persons from families for a desire",
    "to switch some of these contact sports",
    "football soccer field hockey uh to the",
    "spring",
    "lieutenant governor and i have had",
    "conversations with the ohio",
    "high school athletic association uh and",
    "they have given the go ahead for schools",
    "that",
    "want to do that to move to the spring",
    "as we go through this frankly we know",
    "some schools are still deciding",
    "some schools have already made up their",
    "mind they've already already announced",
    "our goal is to provide is to focus on",
    "the",
    "student and to focus on the school",
    "and provide them the best opportunity",
    "they can",
    "so that young person can participate no",
    "one can",
    "guess what the future is going to be we",
    "don't know frankly",
    "what the situation is going to be or how",
    "far into the season we'll be able to get",
    "or we can get all the way into the",
    "season we certainly hope",
    "uh right now nor do can we predict if",
    "things",
    "will be better when it would become time",
    "to play these sports",
    "in in the spring but",
    "this order simply allows sports to move",
    "forward",
    "and we have heard it expressed by some",
    "superintendents and",
    "others that they would like to be able",
    "to have a season",
    "but they don't want to have a season now",
    "we've certainly heard from other schools",
    "and other parents who say we want that",
    "season now",
    "we think this is the best",
    "thing to happen for many many many",
    "reasons",
    "we have noticed that",
    "a good number of our urban schools our",
    "city schools um",
    "have decided not to go back in person",
    "and they've also decided not to have",
    "fall sports",
    "so if there was no opportunity in the",
    "spring to play",
    "and again we can't predict the future we",
    "don't know what",
    "that's going to look like uh but there",
    "is hope",
    "and they will at least have hope and we",
    "hope actually a season",
    "uh they've already made the decision not",
    "to play in the fall so",
    "we don't want to exclude those children",
    "either",
    "we want to give them the hope and the",
    "opportunity to also have",
    "a season",
    "under our orders let me talk for a",
    "moment about spectators",
    "um everyone i've i've talked to",
    "virtually everyone i've talked to has",
    "put the focus exactly where it should be",
    "and that focus should be",
    "on young people letting them play",
    "it's also important i believe that that",
    "young person have",
    "someone there if possible to support",
    "them",
    "there are people there many times as",
    "family members",
    "sometimes it may be someone else who's",
    "very very close",
    "to the family or very very close to that",
    "particular",
    "young person so when our order comes out",
    "what you will see is that we will not",
    "have spectators",
    "other than other than family members",
    "or people very close uh to that",
    "particular child and we'll leave that",
    "course up to the school",
    "you know how to do that we also know",
    "if you talk for example football",
    "in other sports too but i associate this",
    "with football more and that is a",
    "marching band",
    "that might be a drill team that might be",
    "other things that happen during halftime",
    "and so we would want to provide an",
    "opportunity for those parents as well",
    "to be able to come and observe",
    "what is going on so we'll have more",
    "details on that",
    "when the order is actually issued but",
    "that's the",
    "basic uh underpinning",
    "in regard to spectators i think what",
    "you'll see when you look at the orders",
    "there's no big surprises",
    "the health guidance that is in there is",
    "pretty much the guidance that you have",
    "heard from us but you've also heard",
    "on tv you've read in the newspaper",
    "no no big big surprises",
    "i would just express a hope i have a lot",
    "of hopes but",
    "one hope is that",
    "the desire to have a season",
    "i hope that the desire to have a season",
    "will inspire",
    "our young people our athletes our",
    "student athletes",
    "24 7 to be as careful as they can",
    "and i hope also that our coaches and and",
    "john houston and i will be talking with",
    "coaches uh",
    "later today and several different calls",
    "we're also going to be talking to",
    "to superintendents athletic directors",
    "uh on conference calls but our hope is",
    "that the coaches will",
    "use this as an opportunity to to focus",
    "uh",
    "on helping these young people uh",
    "understand what really is at stake",
    "uh and that if they're gonna be able to",
    "play whatever sport it is they're",
    "playing",
    "whether it is soccer football whatever",
    "it is",
    "that they're going to have to do",
    "everything they can to keep covet out",
    "of their their team",
    "so i hope and i believe it will",
    "work uh the driving force that will",
    "inspire our young men",
    "our young women uh to make decisions",
    "in their lives 24 7",
    "and i hope that will inspire them to",
    "make the right decisions to give them",
    "the opportunity",
    "to have the best chance they can to play",
    "their sport to the coaches uh",
    "you in a normal year uh inspire",
    "you mentor you instruct",
    "you instill discipline self-discipline",
    "to your student athletes",
    "for all of that we're very very grateful",
    "parents grandparents everybody else",
    "connects with that child we're very",
    "grateful for what you do you make a lot",
    "of sacrifices",
    "uh you work long hours and you inspire",
    "our kids and so we thank you very very",
    "much",
    "for that but this year this year um",
    "it's going to take more it's going to be",
    "inspiring them",
    "uh in regard to the goal of",
    "keeping covert",

    "children who have been signed up for the",
    "imagination library so if you've not",
    "done so go on go online and",
    "and do that so that's good good good",
    "news",
    "just to conclude success this year in",
    "sports is going to be",
    "measured always by wins and losses and",
    "efforts and",
    "all the things that we you know measure",
    "sports by",
    "but it's also going to be measured",
    "certainly to some extent how well",
    "we can keep the covet away from the team",
    "away from away from the athletes",
    "i think by what we're doing today we're",
    "empowering",
    "our young people we're empowering the",
    "parents we're empowering the schools",
    "to take all the evidence all the",
    "information",
    "and make the best judgment call for that",
    "child",
    "for those children these are tough",
    "tough calls play contact sports",
    "now um",
    "play them in the spring don't play them",
    "um you know these these are all um",
    "tough decisions uh there's not",
    "necessarily a right or wrong",
    "answer we just ask everyone to",
    "to weigh everything make the individual",
    "best decision for that",
    "for that particular child for that team",
    "for that for that school",
    "what we want to do is give as many",
    "options",
    "as possible out there for everyone",
    "as dr borchus pointed out",
    "community itself whatever that community",
    "is that's going to",
    "as far as the covet spread you're going",
    "to see that in the schools",
    "you can take a small rural county that",
    "county can probably",
    "look at the numbers and get a pretty",
    "good idea what that spread is",
    "get a very good idea what that recent",
    "spread is",
    "in the community if you're in a big",
    "urban county",
    "you know much more diverse many more",
    "people",
    "you may have to look at that data more",
    "down more granular more in regard to the",
    "zip code and and things like that but",
    "this information is there",
    "uh if we can help anybody uh",
    "superintendents or anyone",
    "you know dig down into that information",
    "we're more than happy",
    "uh to try to help them",
    "sports is about a lot of things but one",
    "of the things it's about is hope",
    "it doesn't matter what sport it is",
    "hope springs eternal when you when you",
    "start",
    "and so that's we'll end on that that",
    "happy",
    "happy thought but i would just say that",
    "hope itself is is not a plan it's not a",
    "strategy",
    "we all should have hope but we also",
    "should have a plan",
    "so we would ask you those who are making",
    "the decision to play",
    "we wish you every success in the world",
    "we wish your kids every success",
    "in keeping covet away",
    "look at the plan we have and try the",
    "best you can",
    "to to execute that because we believe",
    "that gives you the best chance",
    "your kids the best chance of being able",
    "to play",
    "a season let me now turn it over to the",
    "lieutenant governor",
    "uh john we're a little delayed getting",
    "to you but uh",
    "we have had a little intermission there",
    "so over to the lieutenant governor",
    "great thank you governor uh i know",
    "you've made",
    "a lot of decisions in your governorship",
    "but",
    "i don't think you've made one that's",
    "been more anticipated by teenagers than",
    "this one",
    "and uh i know that hope is a powerful",
    "sustaining presence in our lives and",
    "for a lot of student athletes you've",
    "given them a good dose of hope today so",
    "thank you",
    "for your decision look i know that when",
    "we started working on this from the very",
    "beginning coaches and student athletes",
    "said you know give us a chance give us a",
    "chance to do this and",
    "and today they have that chance they",
    "have that opportunity",
    "but much like the sport you play your",
    "success is going to be",
    "based on how well you execute the game",
    "plan",
    "athletes coaches and families are going",
    "to have to demonstrate the discipline",
    "to follow the rules so that they can",
    "protect themselves and their teammates",
    "and",
    "and control if not stop the spread of",
    "the virus",
    "and uh you know one of the one of the",
    "things i know we've talked about is that",
    "the beneficial",
    "one of the benefits potential benefits",
    "of proceeding with sports",
    "is that the athletes coaches and",
    "families",
    "have that extra incentive have that",
    "extra incentive to make sure that off",
    "the playing field they're",
    "doing the right things like wearing",
    "their masks and",
    "staying socially distanced and stopping",
    "the spread of the virus and",
    "we hope that this announcement will",
    "represent",
    "hundreds of thousands of people who have",
    "an extra incentive",
    "to get this right and as the governor",
    "mentioned the coaches",
    "have an expanded role as educators and",
    "leaders",
    "in this particular year",
    "i also want to mention that",
    "everyone involved must be accountable",
    "in addition to the health department the",
    "ohio high school athletic association",
    "will hold schools",
    "athletes and parents accountable they",
    "will have site inspectors",
    "at contests to ensure that the rules are",
    "being followed",
    "and that the failure to comply with",
    "these rules can result in forfeits of",
    "athletic contests and",
    "disqualification from competition for",
    "the season so",
    "uh the the accountability and the nature",
    "of how we're taking this seriously",
    "is super important so uh when it comes",
    "uh",
    "to the coronavirus we know that there is",
    "uh",
    "no right decision uh and that risk",
    "tolerance and your own personal",
    "circumstances and your limited",
    "alternatives are",
    "are important uh in any of that decision",
    "making and",
    "and as dr borchers and the governor",
    "pointed out you know",
    "go into this with your eyes wide open",
    "know what you have to do",
    "know what uh the circumstances are for",
    "you and your family but for the athletes",
    "out",
    "out there here's your chance to play",
    "sports the sports you love",
    "and the opportunity to show us that you",
    "possess the discipline to make it work",
    "and we all want you to be successful and",
    "healthy",
    "and we're excited for the opportunity",
    "that you have to to do this the right",
    "way",
    "governor thanks john uh we're ready for",
    "questions",
    "governor your first question today is",
    "from ben schwartz at wcpo in cincinnati",
    "hi ben hi governor thank you for",
    "sticking with us through the",
    "difficulties",
    "um my question though i'd like to touch",
    "on kind of how you ended",
    "your last statement about um how tough",
    "this decision",
    "is um i'd like to know how tough the",
    "entire decision process has been for you",
    "and",
    "how hard it was for you to come to this",
    "conclusion regarding sports in the state",
    "and to know if we can expect any changes",
    "to come in the future",
    "if the situation regarding coven 19",
    "changes",
    "specifically regarding uh spectators at",
    "events",
    "well ben yes it's obviously been a been",
    "a difficult decision",
    "and it's difficult decision because we",
    "you know",
    "this is what we value the most uh we",
    "value all lives",
    "uh but we take special care of our kids",
    "and uh you know i think this could be",
    "one of my children out there",
    "playing so friend i have eight kids we",
    "have 24 grandchildren uh you know they",
    "all have played sports at one",
    "one level or the other so we know the",
    "importance of sports we know",
    "how much that season can mean to that",
    "young",
    "person but we also know that look we're",
    "in a critical time in ohio uh you know",
    "our positivity rate has come down below",
    "five",
    "that's good but we also know that we",
    "have some",
    "places where uh that positivity is",
    "triple that",
    "uh in in ohio in some counties uh and",
    "that's",
    "that's of grave grave concern so",
    "what we wanted to do today is to lay out",
    "much",
    "facts as we could we wanted to we've",
    "been working on these",
    "these orders that give guidance and we",
    "would just ask",
    "everyone involved to please read them",
    "because it gives you the guidance to how",
    "we think is the best way to to carry",
    "to carry this out",
    "but these decisions are not made in a",
    "vacuum",
    "it's not just a case of saying okay look",
    "we're going back to school",
    "that's a risk we know that uh we're",
    "playing sports we know that's a risk",
    "that both of those have certainly have",
    "the potential to increase the",
    "spread in the in the community so we you",
    "know",
    "but we also know as i said these",
    "decisions are not made in a vacuum",
    "and you know that child having the",
    "discipline of that sports",
    "having a coach who says look we got to",
    "get this right",
    "men and women we got to do this not just",
    "today at practice not just in the game",
    "coming up",
    "but what you do the rest of the day and",
    "that discipline",
    "uh that desire to have a season",
    "i think uh you know certainly has the",
    "potential",
    "to more than compensate for the added",
    "danger that is there i've also had",
    "parents",
    "who have reached out to me a lot of",
    "parents have reached out to me",
    "and talked about frankly on both sides",
    "of this and talked about mental health",
    "issues",
    "and you know we all know young people",
    "who",
    "sports is what excites them",
    "and that gives them a purpose and it",
    "gives them",
    "a reason to continue to study",
    "and continue to stay focused",
    "so a lot a lot of good things comes out",
    "out of sports",
    "to answer your last question we're going",
    "to see how it goes",
    "we're going to see how it goes going",
    "back to school in person is a risk",
    "but we also know we want our kids back",
    "in school",
    "we want our kids to play sports but we",
    "also know playing sports is a risk",
    "and we're going to have to see how this",
    "goes and so if it doesn't work",
    "if it doesn't work schools are going to",
    "know that pretty quick",
    "the coaches are going to know that",
    "pretty quick we would just ask them to",
    "work with their local health department",
    "very closely",
    "and to make the make the right decisions",
    "we obviously will be looking at this",
    "and we'll see how this how this works",
    "and we hope it works",
    "next question is from steve albritton at",
    "wlwt",
    "in cincinnati hey governor thanks so",
    "much for doing this a two-part question",
    "for you",
    "um one was a mask mandate ever",
    "considered i know at least for football",
    "athletes when it cools off",
    "most if not all of them would throw",
    "something over their face to keep that",
    "cool air",
    "coming into their lungs and also on the",
    "second part um",
    "in this in this order is there anything",
    "with liability for schools is there a",
    "parental release form anything like that",
    "that will be required for athletes to",
    "play",
    "thank you uh yeah two good questions uh",
    "as far as the mask we've left that open",
    "so far",
    "we're gonna see how it works we've left",
    "it open to",
    "the schools the coaches who are",
    "monitoring that",
    "and know what's going on um doesn't mean",
    "that",
    "in that area or other areas that we",
    "can't fine-tune things",
    "if it looks like we need to fine-tune it",
    "we will not hesitate to fine-tune if we",
    "if we think that will help um second as",
    "far as liability",
    "uh this is something that i talked",
    "yesterday liability bill excuse me",
    "uh to the speaker and the senate",
    "president",
    "and i know that they both have bills",
    "moving forward",
    "and so i would hope that there would be",
    "some liability bill",
    "that would would pass and that we could",
    "get to my desk",
    "next question is from jack windsor at",
    "wmfd",
    "in mansfield hi governor hey jack i",
    "missed you",
    "we missed you too sir",
    "uh tough question governor we know that",
    "cobit was",
    "in ohio in january according to data and",
    "in one county",
    "they're claiming it was in november and",
    "since this is highly contagious it",
    "probably did spread massively",
    "without our knowing and at one point in",
    "february before any policies we saw",
    "hospitalization",
    "admissions uh reached i think 1200 in a",
    "day",
    "and the worst we've seen since then",
    "knowing that covet is here is about 700.",
    "we also know that many schools were",
    "closed with a flu-like virus last winter",
    "and many ohioans believe that this was",
    "clovid",
    "yet we had a winter season and we didn't",
    "seem to see serious issues with high",
    "school athletes nor",
    "do we see hospitals overcrowded with",
    "athletes their parents or grandparents",
    "now that we have more immunity better",
    "diagnostic measures",
    "ways to treat covet successfully without",
    "a vaccine and even",
    "the heart condition that dr butchers",
    "mentioned is very rare",
    "according to him given all this data um",
    "it shows like the virus is under control",
    "when you look at the are not",
    "the positivity rate uh case trajectory",
    "and everything",
    "so the tough question is why are we",
    "restricting our kids at all",
    "when we could give them a season free of",
    "restrictions particularly when the cdc",
    "already warned that suicide drug abuse",
    "depression those are much greater issues",
    "than coveted with our kids and that they",
    "are not",
    "transmitting the virus to adults when",
    "you combine this information why can't",
    "we give them a season without",
    "restrictions",
    "well i guess jack i don't agree i",
    "honestly don't agree with everything",
    "you've said",
    "so i'd say so when you start with",
    "different facts i guess you end up with",
    "different conclusions",
    "you know first of all we're seeing",
    "significant spread into rural areas we",
    "never we did not see that before in the",
    "spring",
    "you could live in a rural area in the",
    "spring and not have not know anybody",
    "that had covet",
    "pretty hard to do uh today we've seen it",
    "just spread and if you go up the western",
    "side of the state you see very rural",
    "counties",
    "wonderful people great counties and",
    "they've got horrible spread",
    "uh that's that's one uh two if you look",
    "at",
    "you know you've referenced several times",
    "about you know how many people have",
    "really had it",
    "i think one good way of looking at is",
    "looking at the red cross numbers uh",
    "and you know when somebody goes in to",
    "give blood",
    "not a perfectly sample i suppose but it",
    "does give",
    "some idea because these are people who",
    "don't have any symptoms uh and",
    "and you know they try to determine one",
    "of things they determine is whether or",
    "not they've had covet or not",
    "uh that number has never been been very",
    "very high it's always been",
    "fairly low and frank and interestingly",
    "it's pretty much tracking the last",
    "number i saw is tracking the national",
    "average so it's one or two percent uh i",
    "can't remember exactly",
    "where it came where it came out um and",
    "so",
    "look we can have a season uh we can have",
    "seasons uh",
    "we can have a lot of things uh but",
    "if covet gets into a team it's not gonna",
    "work",
    "uh and so we're just asking everyone to",
    "be careful",
    "uh if you look at you know how we",
    "conduct our lives today in ohio",
    "you know we can do most everything uh we",
    "just got to be careful",
    "uh there's just an added sense of",
    "self-discipline and trying to be careful",
    "and since we're talking about sports and",
    "talking about hope",
    "uh there is hope out there because this",
    "we're gonna get through this",
    "we're gonna get through this it will be",
    "over it will be in our rear view mirror",
    "and we'll look back on it and talk about",
    "it and",
    "and young people will tell their kids",
    "and their grandkids about it",
    "but it will be over and we will be",
    "moving forward but my goal for every",
    "ohioan is to be there",
    "when that happens to make it make sure",
    "your grandmother doesn't get sick",
    "make sure that she can make it make sure",
    "everybody else makes it",
    "uh and finally kids do spread it uh",
    "you know every study has shown uh that",
    "kids do spread it",
    "so particularly those 10 years of age or",
    "older",
    "most of these athletes were talking",
    "about",
    "one of the concerns is they may be fine",
    "um",
    "but do they take it home to somebody in",
    "their family who has a",
    "uh added added medical problem so those",
    "those are the concerns that we would",
    "have thanks jack",
    "governor next question is from danny",
    "eldridge at hannah news service",
    "hello governor sorry about that i was on",
    "mute um",
    "we talked about sports um i guess",
    "another another thing that uh",
    "you know may need to be addressed is uh",
    "the performing arts uh for high school",
    "students and",
    "for the professionals out there who feel",
    "like they you know",
    "are kind of been left in the dark during",
    "during these reopenings um do you have a",
    "can you talk about what plans you have",
    "for",
    "not only uh the professional performing",
    "arts you know and",
    "look and we probably we apologize for",
    "that in regard to the performing arts",
    "uh you know we've had grandchildren uh",
    "who have been in",
    "in school plays and theater and it is uh",
    "something that's just very very very",
    "important uh and it's",
    "uh one of the more amazing things is to",
    "you know see your grandchild up there",
    "with a role in a play and just",
    "how in the world they memorize the lines",
    "and do all the things and the songs and",
    "everything else so",
    "we don't want to leave that behind so",
    "we'll have orders out this week that",
    "will cover that",
    "what we do know is is what the",
    "scientists tell us",
    "and obviously people project and so",
    "that's going to have to be taken care of",
    "somehow",
    "if that may mean moving moving the",
    "audience back further",
    "so there's not that projection uh you",
    "know we're gonna leave that",
    "we're working with the scientists on",
    "that to come up with some sort of plan",
    "for that but we do",
    "don't mean to leave out the performing",
    "arts",
    "very very very important and uh you know",
    "not only is important to",
    "to those who perform but uh for those of",
    "us who can't perform",
    "uh but sit there in the audience and uh",
    "get great joy out of it uh",
    "you know we're always amazed at what",
    "these these actors",
    "actresses and what these performers can",
    "do so",
    "we'll have something next couple days",
    "next question is from laura bischoff at",
    "the dayton daily news",
    "uh hi governor um two quick questions",
    "will teams be following the cdc",
    "guidelines for quarantine",
    "um of their close contacts when they",
    "have a positive or will they be looking",
    "at a shorter period",
    "and also will there be schools where",
    "students are online only yet",
    "after school hours they're out on the",
    "football field or on the cross-country",
    "course",
    "uh competing yeah the answer to the",
    "second question",
    "laura is that's entirely up to the",
    "school and to the families",
    "we have seen you know we've left the",
    "decision uh",
    "about going back to school in person",
    "or a hybrid split or",
    "you know totally online that's up to the",
    "school",
    "also up to the school is the sports",
    "so you could have a combination of being",
    "online and that school made the decision",
    "but we want to play ball they make and",
    "they can do that and so",
    "i think you look at today's announcement",
    "it's just",
    "really kind of following up and",
    "consistent with with that",
    "um you know after consultation with the",
    "ohio",
    "high school athletic association we have",
    "additional option",
    "which is that you know for a contact",
    "sport if the school wants to move it and",
    "they can they can",
    "you know put up come up with a schedule",
    "uh we saw a number of of uh county uh",
    "schools",
    "uh wanting to do that in fact i talked",
    "with john i talked with the pharma",
    "superintendent this morning",
    "uh you know about their ideas of putting",
    "different things together we're fine",
    "we're fine with that we just want to",
    "give them",
    "more more options uh as far as the cdc",
    "yes they've been following the cdc",
    "uh guidelines and uh you know this is",
    "this is where it will be very very",
    "important for them to work with their",
    "with their local health departments so",
    "um you know again in counties or",
    "or in school districts where the spread",
    "is",
    "significant very very significant or",
    "high",
    "that's going to be more difficult it's",
    "just you know",
    "they swim in the ocean of whatever is",
    "out there",
    "and so that's going to make it more",
    "difficult doesn't mean it's impossible",
    "but it's going to make it",
    "certainly certainly more difficult but",
    "again",
    "you know we're going to follow the best",
    "practices",
    "that we follow anywhere else",
    "thank you thank you next question is",
    "from scott house with the xenia daily",

    "and the guidance we had but it's all",
    "look it's like it's like anything else",
    "in life it's execution you know",
    "and the folks who are going to have to",

    "what we call a compliance person they're",
    "gonna have to designate someone on",
    "you know on staff who is the compliance",
    "person who makes sure that",
    "you know everything is in fact being",
    "followed we give them some guidance",
    "uh in regard to the stands uh you know",
    "it's kind of basic goes back to uh",
    "separation of people family members will",
    "be able to be seated",
    "by themselves you come out of a",
    "household you obviously can sit",
    "we'll be able to sit together but what",
    "we don't want",
    "is people from other households",
    "you know close in so we want to separate",
    "people out",
    "we will have a we will have a cap uh but",
    "the focus really will be on",
    "parents um and you know and",
    "we'll let the schools work this out",
    "we're not going to tell them how to do",
    "it but",
    "but the focus has been really clear of",
    "what people have told",
    "me that is hey let's have the kids play",
    "it's most important thing",
    "second most important thing is have",
    "their loved ones there to cheer them on",
    "somebody who makes a difference in that",
    "child's life so that's that's what our",
    "emphasis is i think when you you",

    "we hope it's only you know it's one",
    "season uh but",
    "but the young people are going to get to",
    "play and that we think is the most",
    "important thing",
    "next question is from kevin landers at",
    "wbns in columbus",
    "good afternoon governor kevin i wanted",
    "to switch",
    "topics a little bit i wanted to talk",
    "about voting does one dropbox per 1",
    "million people",
    "make any sense to you and if so can you",
    "explain why and also do you support the",
    "president's",
    "decision to begin making reforms to the",
    "postal service so close to an election",
    "well no president didn't consult me on",
    "that",
    "um look i i think there's a real",
    "consensus",
    "among republicans and democrats that",
    "um you know there are certainly",
    "challenges with the post office",
    "but um you know we don't want in any way",
    "have a situation where the post office",
    "does not have the resources they need",
    "to get the ballots out get the ballots",
    "back",
    "uh so you know one thing that franklin",
    "rose",
    "uh always reminds everybody and i'm",
    "going to let john houston say something",
    "or ask john if he wants to say something",
    "because he was former secretary of state",
    "but you know people can apply",
    "early send in your letter asking for",
    "that",
    "application and then my understanding is",
    "when the magical date comes they can",
    "send that right to you",
    "and you'll get it early get it back um",
    "and i think that is that is important",
    "john you want to add anything",
    "to kevin's sure to my answer to kevin's",
    "question",
    "uh look the post office needs to have",
    "adequate personnel",
    "staffing and and machinery to do its job",
    "the system that we are operating in in",
    "ohio has worked very well for more than",
    "a decade",
    "in many cases they there were never drop",
    "boxes",
    "uh everybody get your absentee ballot",
    "applications in",
    "the ballots will be sent to you a month",
    "in advance before the election",
    "get them back out mail them in you can",
    "track that ballot online",
    "all the way back to your board of",
    "elections to make sure that it was",
    "received and will be counted",
    "so we have the tracking mechanisms we",
    "have the infrastructure in place",
    "the post office needs to do its job ohio",
    "system has worked",
    "that system is not changing we need the",
    "post office to execute and it'll work",
    "it'll work out fine",
    "voters should not be worried about their",
    "ballots",
    "being counted or being uh sent through",
    "the mail",
    "as long as they turn them in on time uh",
    "if it's postmarked",
    "in advance uh of elect of of the day",
    "before or",
    "of election day it will be counted so",
    "make sure that i just i want to have a",
    "reassuring message in here",
    "ohio it's worked in ohio in the past",
    "we're not doing anything differently",
    "for the most part and so it will it will",
    "work again",
    "thanks john who's next",
    "next question is from andy chow at ohio",
    "public radio and television",
    "hi governor i'm wondering if i could try",
    "to squeeze two questions and one",
    "as far as high school sports go will",
    "athletes be required to be tested before",
    "games",
    "and then as far as this decision goes",
    "how important have the past couple of",
    "weeks of declining numbers how",
    "did those play a role in your decision",
    "today",
    "uh yes to the second question",
    "uh look uh we still are seeing mixed",
    "numbers",
    "uh but positivity has now reached as i",
    "recall",
    "4.5 that is down two full points from",
    "where it was probably two months ago",
    "uh now that is statewide it doesn't mean",
    "that we don't have places",
    "where it is high and those are the",
    "places as i've made very clear that i",
    "worry most about",
    "and just a little pitch for sports and",
    "for our",
    "athletes the most important thing you",
    "can do if you live in a",
    "area that's red or if you live in an",
    "area that is orange or really any place",
    "in ohio if you want your kids to play",
    "football if you want them to",
    "participate in soccer and whatever the",
    "the sport is",
    "the most important thing you can do is",
    "wear a mask be careful",
    "because the community spread is going to",
    "be directly reflected",
    "uh in into into that school so yeah that",
    "played a big",
    "uh a big part as far as testing uh there",
    "i know there was confusion we had a",
    "previous",
    "two orders ago and then the last order",
    "was just repeated it was never our",
    "intent that the testing requirement",
    "would be for students now if school has",
    "the ability to test",
    "that would be good but we're not you",
    "know we don't assume that",
    "in fact we're assuming that testing is",
    "not going to be that widespread unless",
    "someone has a symptom but we're willing",
    "we're certainly willing to work with the",
    "schools on this",
    "the other thing annie that's going on as",
    "you well know",
    "is this testing situation is changing",
    "it's changing very quickly",
    "we have started for example testing",
    "of all our you heard earlier about our",
    "testing that we have going on",
    "in the veterans home but we're going",
    "through now",
    "and actually it's being done uh in",
    "assisted living homes",
    "uh in residences uh you know we're on a",
    "two",
    "two week cycle of testing uh and that",
    "testing is taking",
    "taking place so the testing is more and",
    "more opportunities",
    "uh we have uh some opportunities to",
    "bring in more testing and we're going to",
    "continue to do that so",
    "where we are in a month from now or",
    "where we are two months from now",
    "i can't tell you but today it's pretty",
    "clear",
    "that it would be a very unusual high",
    "school that would have the ability",
    "to do any kind of testing uh you know",
    "regularly",
    "to do testing it just so that's not part",
    "of this order",
    "it's not part of our working assumption",
    "it's not ba",
    "you know it's not what we base this",
    "decision on",
    "thank you next question is from jeff",
    "redick at wsyx in columbus",
    "hello governor hi jeff",
    "um i know you said that this applies to",
    "high school sports and youth sports does",
    "your order also apply to college sports",
    "of all kinds um",
    "if so i know there's a lot of",
    "consternation about what's going on at",
    "ohio state with the cancellation of big",
    "ten season",
    "um did you know anything about their",
    "testing program and would you set your",
    "foot in the waters of people who are",
    "trying to get those sports",
    "started again this fall uh what i've",
    "learned about ohio state's testing",
    "program frankly has come",
    "after the fact as we were looking at",
    "high school",
    "this order is focused primarily",
    "on high school but",
    "you know it would certainly apply and",
    "will apply",
    "to college as well",
    "you know this is a moving target as you",
    "know some schools have",
    "some leagues have decided not to play a",
    "big ten of course",
    "uh the mac uh so that knocked off uh you",
    "know a number of",
    "certainly division one schools uh in",
    "ohio there's other leagues have decided",
    "not to play so it's a",
    "it's a it's a moving target but you know",
    "this would apply",
    "uh to those teams as well those schools",
    "as well",
    "next question is from uh jim province at",
    "the toledo blade",
    "hello governor this is a bit of a",
    "follow-up to",
    "jeff's question we've seen some of the",
    "major",
    "college football conferences including",
    "the big ten postpone their football",
    "seasons",
    "because they don't think it's safe right",
    "now for college athletes",
    "we've seen some professional teams that",
    "have been unable to keep the",
    "virus out of the locker rooms etc why do",
    "we think",
    "it's going to be any different in a high",
    "school",
    "gymnasium or on the field",
    "well jim that certainly gives us all",
    "pause",
    "you know these decisions you'd have to",
    "talk to the different sports know",
    "the leagues about why they made made",
    "those decisions",
    "i've never said this is going to be easy",
    "we have provided opportunities",
    "first it starts the family family can",
    "say we're not playing",
    "school can say we're not playing",
    "school can then say if it wants to if we",
    "don't want to do that i can say we're",
    "going to play",
    "we're going to try to play in the spring",
    "but when you look at",
    "i think you have to look at this from a",
    "holistic",
    "point of view and the",
    "holistic point of view is what's best",
    "for that individual",
    "person that individual child that",
    "individual",
    "athlete and",
    "all the things that go with sports",
    "so if you only worried if you only",
    "worried about",
    "the hours in a day that that",
    "student athlete would be in practice",
    "or in a game pretty one-sided decision i",
    "think",
    "but we're dealing with a person and",
    "we're dealing with what they do",
    "the other times of the day",
    "uh and we're gonna we're gonna see",
    "but i am hopeful uh you know",
    "whether the that desire that discipline",
    "uh to succeed uh instilled by the coach",
    "and self instilled by the athlete",
    "uh will make them safer",
    "or as safe as they would have been",
    "if they were not playing the sport so",
    "none of this we know it's all a",
    "we hope educated guess we don't know",
    "where the virus will be in the spring",
    "we don't know really where the virus",
    "will be in three weeks from now",
    "um and you know we stand ready quite",
    "candidly uh if this goes the wrong way",
    "uh to shut it shut it all down",
    "but i looked at this",
    "as a very close call",
    "and i listened",
    "to what many parents have told me about",
    "the problems connected",
    "with their child being out of school",
    "their child who",
    "had major focus on sports that kept him",
    "or her focused",
    "kept them in school kept them focused on",
    "getting good grades",
    "kept them focused on a lot of things and",
    "you pull that away and i've had",
    "a lot of people describe for us and it's",
    "not just the studies that have been done",
    "about what impact that has on that",
    "particular child",
    "so it's not just a question of hey the",
    "hours their play sports the hours they",
    "you know is is that worth it the whole",
    "the question is it's the it's a bigger",
    "picture",
    "and and frankly we're allowing parents",
    "to make that decision",
    "uh we're allowing schools to make that",
    "decision",
    "if it goes off the rails if it goes off",
    "the rails",
    "don't doubt that we'll we'll step in",
    "john yeah",
    "thanks governor a couple things just",
    "really to emphasize",
    "you know if you're talking about 16 year",
    "olds 17 year olds high school athletes",
    "they're they're in a position that",
    "they're going to go out and compete",
    "it just when you look at this and i know",
    "from my life experiences in talking to",
    "coaches",
    "are they better with the incentive to",
    "play and to keep themselves",
    "protected 24 hours a day",
    "under a coach's supervision in these",
    "rules than they would be to be left to",
    "their own devices and go out and play",
    "pickup games and",
    "do unorganized things as they do and i",
    "you know i just think that they're going",
    "to there's more of an incentive for them",
    "to do this right",
    "and to get the the education and",
    "coaching that they need",
    "to to sustain this uh under a more",
    "structured situation and governor",
    "one thing i don't know if we pointed out",
    "is the effective",
    "date of when this can occur and that",
    "would be august the 21st",
    "august the 21st would would be the the",
    "effective date",
    "for resumption of these activities",
    "you know in a sense we're candidly we're",
    "putting a lot on the coaches we're",
    "putting",
    "on the athletic directors and and",
    "everybody in the school",
    "but you know they're the ones who can",
    "most directly uh impact this they're the",
    "ones who",
    "you know are there to inspire this",
    "student athlete",
    "every other day and a lot of it is",
    "execution i mean there's you know",
    "fran i've had uh i guess all our kids",
    "have run cross country most of our uh",
    "grandkids have run cross country they've",
    "done other sports played soccer done",
    "other things as well",
    "uh but a lot of it's going to be in the",
    "execution",
    "uh you know if you've got a if you've",
    "got a cross-country team and they're and",
    "they're practicing i know",
    "what kids like to do they're out running",
    "a road or they're out running where in a",
    "park or wherever they're running they",
    "like to be bunched together that's what",
    "they want to do",
    "you can't do that now i mean you can't",
    "be in a situation where",
    "you know the one athlete is uh breathing",
    "on the other one for uh you know 60",
    "minutes or",
    "longer so it's just things like that",
    "that we can't write in orders we can't",
    "micromanage",
    "but that every coach is going to have to",
    "figure out okay",
    "it's not just during the event it's not",
    "just during the meet not just during the",
    "game",
    "it's all the time i'm working with this",
    "young person and they're in training",
    "how are we going to do the training",
    "everything has to has to be rethought",
    "just like we",
    "rethink everything else during this time",
    "of coba",
    "again next year we hope everybody's back",
    "and we're back doing the things that",
    "in the way we wanted to do them but this",
    "is no ordinary time",
    "this is a different time it will end but",
    "during this time",
    "all of us have to be different frankly",
    "who has next question big zuckerman from",
    "ohio capitol journalist next question",
    "hello governor this is jake zuckerman",
    "here uh",
    "uh if the if the fda does authorize a",
    "copic vaccine",
    "to and brings it to the market they're",
    "gonna be some questions to answer like",
    "how does the vaccine get",
    "out who gets it first and who if anyone",
    "must get it",
    "can you detail any planning on this",
    "front and do you expect to",
    "request any kind of legislation of this",
    "alley from the ga",
    "you know that's an excellent question i",
    "i don't think frankly",
    "we know one would assume uh that there",
    "will be",
    "protocols that will be national",
    "protocols",
    "uh but i'm we're talking to doctors now",
    "uh in case that's there's not national",
    "protocols",
    "that are set you know how how would we",
    "set that in",
    "in ohio uh these are decisions that",
    "politicians shouldn't make",
    "bluntly these are decisions that we",
    "should leave to",
    "to infectious disease experts and people",
    "who really understand",
    "you know what is vitally important to",
    "save the most lives",
    "and how do we quickly or quick as we can",
    "get control of this",
    "so it's something that we're already",
    "starting to talk with doctors about",
    "if there's not national guidance we will",
    "we will have we will be ready",
    "do you expect to need help from the",
    "legislature to rule anything out",
    "well i don't know yet frankly i really",
    "don't know yet",
    "again again you know we have to see",
    "where this discussion goes",
    "and we'll try to do this",
    "decision like we've done everything else",
    "and that is to rely on doctors to rely",
    "on medical community",
    "uh and try to make the you know the most",
    "informed informed decision but these are",
    "not",
    "typically uh politician decisions",
    "elected officials we've got to bring the",
    "people in",
    "and who who can tell us you know the",
    "health experts",
    "how can we save the most lives how can",
    "we slow the spread the quickest",
    "governor next question is the last",
    "question and it belongs to jackie",
    "borchardt of the cincinnati enquirer",
    "hey jackie hey how are you um this this",
    "plan today leaves a lot of decisions",
    "to local schools does the order give",
    "them any guidance such as",
    "specific metrics or benchmarks uh about",
    "how to reach that decision",
    "and what would you consider going off",
    "the rails to look like",
    "well that's a good question um i think",
    "when you see the order",
    "you'll see you'll see there's a lot of",
    "guidance in there",
    "it would be great to see the order but",
    "not yeah you'll get to see that tomorrow",
    "i think i don't think it's quite done",
    "but uh but as far as the decision",
    "look jackie we've",
    "i we're not very we haven't been too",
    "subtle about this i mean",
    "you know if you're in a community where",
    "you've got widespread covenant spread",
    "you've got to think long and hard about",
    "having contact sports in the fall",
    "i mean we're not going to tell them not",
    "to do it but you know that is part of",
    "the process",
    "whatever it is in the community it will",
    "be in your school and whatever it is in",
    "your school will be",
    "you know at least going in with those",
    "athletes",
    "no reason to think it's going to be any",
    "any different so that's why",
    "we continue to talk about the importance",
    "of schools",
    "communities rather uh you know if they",
    "want their kids back in school",
    "then wear the mask cut this spread down",
    "keep it keep the distance so you know as",
    "the as doctors butcher said schools",
    "and athletes and teams you know have got",
    "to look at",
    "what the environment is that they exist",
    "in",
    "i think i would also frankly look at who",
    "are the teams i'm going to play",
    "how's the spread in with those teams in",
    "from that community that we're going to",
    "be intermixing with",
    "for several hours i would look i would",
    "look at that",
    "i think that is is certainly very",
    "important uh as",
    "as well so those are the you know",
    "there's no secret about what the kind of",
    "the metrics are or",
    "or how you go about making this decision",
    "but ultimately every school is different",
    "every child is different",
    "and you got to try to tailor the answer",
    "um",
    "for that child i would just also say and",
    "ask",
    "our schools our coaches uh we'll get a",
    "chance john i'm gonna have a chance to",
    "talk",
    "with them and the superintendents here",
    "shortly um",
    "as well as athletic directors but look",
    "be flexible be flexible",
    "you know make this work if it doesn't",
    "work",
    "it doesn't work pull back uh you know if",
    "you're not too far in the season maybe",
    "you can flip over to the",
    "you know you'll want to make a decision",
    "to flip over and do it try to do it in",
    "in the spring",
    "you we just we've just got to be",
    "flexible because we're dealing with so",
    "many things that are unknown i mean",
    "you know our our positivity rate is down",
    "but it's not down in every county it's",
    "up it's up in a lot of counties",
    "overall statewide it's down but a lot of",
    "particular rural counties",
    "we're seeing it we're seeing it go go up",
    "so",
    "i see that my time is up uh thank you",
    "all very very much we'll see you",
    "back here i believe at two o'clock on",
