[Music]
ah
[Music]
so
afternoon everyone
fran i want to extend our best wishes to
the first lady
and to the president for a good recovery
you think about them we think about
everyone who is
battling the covet today across our
country and
and around the world
i want to update everyone on today's
data
as you can see our deaths are a very
high
rate and again i would remind everyone
that the deaths that we report
today that came in yesterday
do not reflect the day of the death
necessarily
it's the day that it comes into us
and so we never like to see these
numbers high
and this is a a high number but
it does not necessarily mean uh that
these were
recent it spreads over a period of of
time
second the case number at
1495 is very very
alarming um that
number now uh is this number of 21 day
average
is now back over over a thousand and so
we do not
like to see that we have seen in in the
last
week our positivity numbers statewide
ticking up as well and the
hospitalization numbers
uh now for the first time in a long time
are really
are starting to go back up uh
eric if you could show the hospital
numbers there
this is let me just go to this first
this is our top 20 counties again
very similar to what we we showed
yesterday
um not a significant uh obviously change
in one day
and these are the top 20.
this is the top 88 and eric let's go to
the
hospital slide a little explanation on
the hospital slide
this area through here is considered
incomplete so these numbers continue to
fill in
so what is concerning uh is we're
starting we're seeing a
we're seeing a significant increase even
though these are still
filling in so when you see that kind of
uh go up rather dramatically and we know
that that will continue to go up as more
of those numbers fill in
uh for those particular days so we're
concerned concerned about
that um fran and i had a
test about an hour ago an hour and a
half ago
and we do not have the results back yet
happy to take any questions
first question today is from ben
schwartz at wcpo in cincinnati
hey ben hi governor hey ben
do you believe average ohioans will ever
be able to be tested
if they see fit like the president's
able to and
in light of this um president trump
testing positive
do you have any plans to test yourself
more frequently for
covet 19 um
i haven't really thought about myself or
fran uh
we felt we should take a test today
um ben i'm not sure i got the entire
part of the first part of the question
but i
think it was about availability of
testing for the average ohioan
uh i think this is going to go up
dramatically i was on the phone
about two hours ago with the head of
abbott labs
they have produced these strips that we
hope to receive in ohio the first batch
of these next week
this is something that the white house
signed a contract
with abbott labs these are quick
tests um they are tests that
are uh basically a strip
so that you know they will be
fairly readily available so
this is going to increase the testing we
think there'll be more of these come on
the market so yes
i think you know we're going to see in
the next few weeks a significant
increase we're still looking exactly how
to deploy
these tests but we want to fill in
whatever gaps we have
left in nursing homes because this is
the most vulnerable
people in ohio we have but also these
could be used to help
kids get back in school quicker that
could be used at the college level
as well and their other uses so we're
looking at an array of uses
for these but this will be the first
tests that are like this that are yes we
said
sort of like pregnancy tests that you
just you can read them quickly they do
not have to go to a lab
and they're relatively cheap uh so when
we start
buying these uh these first tests that
we've
will receive we hope next week are free
to
ohio the federal government has paid for
these the white house has paid for these
once we run through that and that
contract runs out
it's my understanding these are going to
be at the cost
i think of five dollars apiece so those
that will be the cost to
to us in the state so they're going to
be relatively cheap
and they're quick and they're they're
pretty accurate
so we're excited about that
next question is from farnoosh amiri at
the associated press
hi governor thank you for taking the
time today um
i want to talk about i wanted to ask you
what are your concerns
about pushback that we've seen since the
pandemic began on chronovirus protective
measures by
some republican lawmakers in ohio and in
other places
including some gop governors who often
seem to be following the president's
lead
has sent the wrong message about how to
approach um
the handling of this deadly virus that
now we've seen impacts everybody even
the president of the united states
well yes even the president of the
united states uh i think this is a
powerful reminder uh to us that we have
to do the basic things
um we have to wear a mask we have to
social distance
we have to be careful we have to avoid
big crowds
i mean it's it's for all of us i mean
look it's it's
you know as careful as fran and i have
been um
you know this was a you know a reminder
to us
as well uh and i think it's just a
reminder to everybody
that this virus um
loves everybody the same as dr atkin
used to say
or hates everybody the same but uh
it does not discriminate and it's gonna
go after anybody
uh and so and it's very just very very
contagious
so uh it it i think is a powerful
reminder and for us to pay attention
the president united states can get this
the first lady can get this
we can get it too and we just got to be
very very careful
next question is from andy chow at ohio
public radio and television
hi governor hey andy when it comes to
uh what we saw at the debate on tuesday
we've seen pictures and hearing reports
that there were many people in the
debate hall who were not wearing
masks although it was mandatory
what do you think about the fact that
people didn't wear masks and does the
state plan
on finding the cleveland clinic for not
enforcing the mask mandate well i was
not in the hall
so i don't know what first of all i
don't know what the facts are
in regard in regard to that i will say
about the cleveland clinic
um it is a great institution
um and i know the lieutenant governor
has talked
to the ceo today so i'm going to
reference john here in a minute
um but you know i think they did a very
very good job
and did what they could do but john i
know you had a statement
you wanted to make and also if you want
to have any any comments
about andy's andy's question yeah
look i was there for the entire day
uh to get in the debate hall you had to
have a
a test that came back negative
for the virus everybody who got in
had to have their temperature taken
everybody who got in
had to wear a mask i saw
andy i saw almost everybody had a mask
on
inside the venue i didn't i wasn't in a
position i could see
everyone but everybody that was in my
sight line
uh had a mask on outside of the
participants in the debate
well i know that there were a couple
people there who may not have had
i thought the cleveland clinic did a
really fine job along with case western
at creating an environment that was as
safe as you could make something like
that
there were at least six feet between
chairs
uh the people um were very you know
everybody was very respectful for one
another
i thought it was uh i thought it was as
well done as you could do something like
that
and and so uh um you know that that
would be my
that would be my reaction to that
observation is that
my personal experience of being there i
thought they did a pretty good job
next question is from jim province at
the toledo blade
hello governor hey jim hi um has the
state noticed any kind of a link between
any new cases that might be associated
with the two rallies that the president
had uh
last week those would still be within
the uh 14 day
time frame and can you tell me i mean
how close were you to the president was
he wearing a mask when you met with him
and were you wearing a mask um
fran and i went on air first one after
it landed
uh we went in in the back walked through
it
went to the president's cabin and a
friend i both had masks on
and the president did not as i recall
and your other question jim had to do
with with the uh
we don't i've not been told
uh that anybody out in the counties
as far as the local health departments
have picked anything up at this point
um if if they do
as far as from you know something coming
from the rally we certainly will tell
you that
um you know this is a tracing
operation and you know if something
shows up we certainly will we'll
disclose that
next question is from laura hancock at
cleveland.com
hey laura governor um i was just
wondering
kind of circling back to the legislature
um they're not required when
they're in the state house to wear masks
and i was just wondering if um this is
be this is reckless especially since a
lot of them have met
the president in person and might hit
home more
yeah i mean i i was at the end of your
question
laura
i i missed the last part i thought i'm
just wondering if you think it's
reckless
that they're choosing not to mandate
masks when they're in their chambers
well look it's a separate branch of
government
they make their own decisions but i
think what this reminds us
is that anybody that you come in contact
may have the covet anybody
and that there's no one who is immune
from it
that anybody can have it and because of
the fact
that so many people we know have had it
who didn't have symptoms
or had very light symptoms you have to
literally treat everybody you come in
contact with
as if they have it and again if the
president united states can have it
um you know that means anybody can have
it
and so it just it is a reminder to us
and i would urge every one of our
citizens
and i'm watching these numbers as i said
a moment ago and i i
brought these numbers out today because
it was such a huge jump in the number of
cases
close to fifteen hundred cases new cases
uh but frankly i'm worried uh you know
we were doing pretty well um
in on many metrics but i can see this
trend now
setting in and we can stop this trend if
we'll wear a mask
please wear a mask when you're out there
you can stop it
um we control this uh
this is this is not rocket science this
is not difficult
i mean it's it's we know what works
we're a mask work keeping distance
works staying away from large crowds
works not going in even if you're
friends or with family without mask on
and try whatever you're doing
still pretty decent weather outside and
you can you know do it do it outside
i mean these are just basic things that
if we execute on these
eighty percent of us eighty-five percent
of us will wear a mask
all throughout the state of ohio we'll
knock this thing down
and this is just a reminder you know
when
we approach someone or someone is close
to us we have to assume
that they could have the virus
next question is from adrian robbins at
wcmh in columbus
governor thank you for doing this today
in light of the president's
diagnosis and in light of the trend that
you talk about we are seeing here in
ohio
are you concerned about future campaign
events over the next four weeks coming
to ohio
the trump campaign says they may go
virtual but the vice president will
continue to campaign
especially considering reports of rules
not being followed at cleveland clinic
and the large crowds and few masks we've
seen at other events
look we just ask everyone
be careful
that includes churches that includes if
you're going to a funeral that includes
if you're going to a political rally
wherever you're going to you just have
to assume
that they're going to be people there
who are positive and you have to treat
it
like that and if you treat it like that
you're going to be safe and and so um
you know i think that candidates can
have events
with people there but they have to be
very careful about it
and we would just urge the social
distancing while the weather is still
good
campaign throughout october candidates
are used to
doing outside events you know please do
it outside if you can
and you know people should should keep a
distance
when they're there doesn't mean you have
to stop campaigning it doesn't mean you
have to
you know curtail it down to a you know
miniscule number of people
but just following the basic precautions
uh is what we need to do it's what we
all need to do no matter what we're
doing
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
hey governor max so two questions today
one is the state of ohio involved with
any contact tracing efforts the white
house might be conducting
given the president's diagnosis and two
following up on adrian's question
given what you said about how it's
impossible to know who has the virus and
we need to just assume
that everyone has it wouldn't it be
safer to just move all campaign events
online for the time being
well look
we're trying to learn to live with this
and i believe we can live with this if
we're cautious
so just as we have said here are the
guidelines
for high school sports
here are the guidelines for this and
that
here are the guidelines for a restaurant
here are the guidelines for a bar
if people will carefully carefully
follow the guidelines we can live with
this virus
and so i would not make an exception for
campaigns and campaign and say campaigns
should just you know be totally virtual
uh we're not saying that about other
things in society
and you know and virtually everything's
open in ohio
i know there's some restrictions we have
restrictions on bars we've got
some restrictions on on restaurants as
far as
they've got to be six feet apart but
there's no capacity limit
so you know first of all everything's
open uh
and so no i wouldn't say that campaigns
need to completely shut down
i just think they need to be careful
they need to be compliant uh with
with what we request everybody to do and
that is just
be careful keep that distance we're a
mask
next question is from alex ebert at
bloomberg
oh let me just say i for i did not
answer
uh we are not to my uh knowledge
involved in working with the white house
on any contact tracing
if that's different we'll put out a
release on it
but that's i have no knowledge that
we're doing that
good afternoon governor thanks so much
for taking our our questions
um in the past you've talked about
messages you received from
folks in the legislature and friends
they were critical of
mass mandates and other restrictions
that you've you've imposed to camp down
in the virus have you received any
messages
in the last few hours now that we've
seen president trump and
firstly melania trump contract the virus
and what have they been
thank you message from legislators
yes sir message from legislators and and
those in your friends circle who have
questioned your past steps
i've not seen any but i've not i've not
checked my
text messages or emails for the last two
or three hours
so i've had pretty non-stop schedule and
haven't really looked at it much today
so i'm not aware of any
next question is from josh ruttenberg at
spectrum
news
hey governor how are you hey josh
hey set a question for you and also for
a different question for the lieutenant
governor um
i'll start with you governor uh to pick
you back off of an earlier question when
it had to do with republican lawmakers
and you said that
the other branch of government has their
own rules and they can abide by them but
lawmakers in this state are still
residents so
are you concerned that they are not
setting a good example
for the rest of their constituents and
for the rest of ohioans that they are
not wearing masks and then
lieutenant governor for you um i
understand that you might have gotten
tested today
are your test results uh available and
also you said that the cleveland clinic
um did everything that they could in a
very fine way but there are pictures
there
of people who were not wearing masks so
what do you have to say about that
i'll start uh and then we'll go then
we'll go to john
um i would not assume that legislators
will not in the future
wear a mask i mean i don't think we
should make that assumption
we'll see john
uh yeah i i will
uh say that you know i was there on
tuesday
um well i i know that there were
on occasion i think i saw one or two
people who didn't have a mask on i can i
can only
i can only say what i saw uh and as far
as the cleveland clinic doing
their job i thought that they and case
western reserve university
did everything they could to get people
to do the right thing
but as we've learned in life you know in
trying to get them to do those things
and to follow the rules
not everybody does it and and
but i can tell you that everybody that i
observed did
that i observed um for the most part i
mean everyone that i saw as i sat there
i
had a mask on as far as me um
i did uh have a test earlier today i
don't have the results back on that i'm
self quarantined at home
out of a out of an abundance of caution
i
did not come within 50 feet
at minimum of president or anybody who
was part of
of the group i guess it was one of those
times that not having a good seat was a
good thing
uh it was uh but we're gonna
you know wait until uh wait until we get
the results of the test and
until then i'll just be at home
next question is from jake zuckerman at
ohio capitol journal
good afternoon governor your
administration declined to enforce
mass requirements at the president's
rally in september
do you think that action or non-actions
like that kind of
muddle and confuse a public health
message that people should wear masks
and on that note are you considering
expanding the mask order to include the
state house
no i don't run i don't look everybody
around
us is wearing masks everybody works for
the governor should be wearing masks
you know what the other two branches of
government do i
i you know i can't control that uh
but look um
i want to just urge people again to wear
a masks and
you know the truth is if you talk to
scientists you
talk to people who understand this if we
could get
90 of the people to wear masks
what the ones who aren't going to wear a
mask not wear the mask
you know if we could hit 90
we would just these numbers would not be
what you saw today
it simply would not be you know this is
pushing 1500 cases
um for a day and that is not
that is not good we're not headed in the
right direction so
you know we've got to get control of
this uh before we get into into winter
because winter the experts think will
be even worse so we gotta we gotta be in
a better in a in a better position
and again i'll go back to what i said
before we're not asking people not to
live and we're not asking them not
we're asking them to live with figure
out how to live with this virus
and the vaccine is coming and you know
when that vaccine comes it doesn't mean
we can stop wearing a mask
but we when we get you know people
vaccinated significant numbers then
you're going to see
obviously you're going to start seeing
some changes so you know look there's
hope out there
sun's out we're going to make it through
this
but we've just got to have the
discipline to do the essential basic
things you know it's like in sports when
a
coach tells you you guys just do the
essential things if you do the essential
things in the sport
you're going to be okay and that's what
we've got to do we have to do the basics
next question is from chelsea sick at
wkef
in dayton hi governor
we did have we had both president donald
trump and donald trump jr here in the
miami valley just within the last two
weeks
and i talked to two local public health
departments who say because of the
exemptions for political events the
crown size
makes it nearly impossible to contact
trace if they needed to
what would you say to those public
health departments and the people
attending these rallies
you know this election season is um you
know we still have over a month before
election day
okay i am i am i really apologize i was
not picking up
picking that up i got the public health
i got the president here
um but i didn't catch the rest of it i'm
sorry could you just
say it again yeah that's okay um the
crowd size
the public health department says that
the crowd size because of
the exemptions makes it nearly
impossible to contact trace
at these events if they needed to what
advice would you give to these public
health departments
and the people attending these rallies
so early on in election season
yeah i mean what they what the health
department told you is what they what
they told you
um you know again we we hope
in the future you know we don't see
crowds like that
uh we hope in the future we have
distancing uh
but uh the
the truth is you know
we have very little ability
despite what we ask people to do it
still comes down to what people will do
and what people are willing to do
and that's you know that's the situation
we're in
uh and we asked people to do these
things
you know again i think this is a
powerful reminder
uh what's happened to the president the
first lady is a powerful reminder of how
difficult this is and
that this virus you know is out there
looking for victims
and so going into a crowd where there
are a lot of people and there's no
social distancing and people are making
are not wearing masks is is not good
next question is from josh swigert at
the dayton daily news
josh afternoon governor um
as has been mentioned the president was
obviously in cleveland for the debate
along with hope hicks
and uh the day after the debate uh
donald trump jr visited tip city north
of here and there was a rally
about 400 people there most of whom did
not have masks on
can you describe the public health
effort underway to determine if any of
these events
led to a spread of covet to the public
or to any officials that
they met with and a second thing just
do you know when you or the lieutenant
governor might have results from the
tests that you took
we'll make we'll make my results
available i'm sure the lieutenant
governor will as soon as we get them
back
the tracing is done at 113
local health departments so you know if
we're talking about
tip city we're obviously talking about
miami county so
you know that's who leads leads that
effort
i don't know what contact our team at
the
state health department has had with
them but i'll find out
governor um if if i could add something
which you know as an administration we
have encouraged
um people wearing masks everywhere
including
at these rallies i know that i've only
been to one of them i spoke and i stood
up in front of the crowd
and i asked them to wear masks both
there and
and outside of there so we've been
pretty consistent about the value of
this and
we know that that that people don't like
to wear them
it's inconvenient but as i always try to
say that when you when you wear this
it does show your consideration for each
other you know to to make sure that
we're taking
care of one another and i hope people
can can view it in that vein that
it's just a symbol of how a real not
just a symbol but an act of courtesy
next question is from james pilcher at
wkrc
in cincinnati good afternoon governor
hamilton county as well as some other
counties in southwest
ohio have jumped back into the red
category
do you have any specific reasons or do
you know of anything that is causing
that to rise and do you have any other
specific
reasons that you can point to for the
overall state high numbers
i can tell you that kentucky has had
three days of
thousand or nearly a thousand cases as
well thank you
well we talked a little bit about
hamilton county i think we've got
something up on
on the web about
hamilton county but we are seeing
a if you look at the map
western ohio is the most prevalent area
literally starting from toledo all the
way down to cincinnati
um it probably is a number of things
uh we're we're starting to see
whereas in the last several months you
know we had a
big number under the age of 30.
we are now seeing those numbers higher
age
what we don't know is whether or not
this is just
young people getting infected and then
turning around and infecting
an older person and that was our fear
but we really don't have the data
yet to tell whether that's really what's
taking place i mean i talked to our data
team yesterday
before the press conference about that
very specific issue they could not tell
me
uh yet and you know
the the tracing that we do um
you know many times particularly when
you have as widespread
community spread as we have today it's
difficult for the tracers and the
counties to come up with one particular
place
that that person got it so
i don't have a great answer i just can
tell you what we're seeing
it's it's going up you know we've seen
this uptick
in the upper midwest um and we
had avoided it uh so far
but uh you know you're seeing you know
an uptick
in indiana and as i said the western
part of the state
is certainly worse than than the eastern
part of ohio
next question is from haley nelson at
wsyx in columbus
thank you for the time we've seen some
leaders in other states in new jersey
for example encourage folks who may have
been at a political
rally to get tested for covet 19 is that
the same advice for folks here in ohio
who were at a rally or
perhaps in the presidential debate for
example should they go out and get
tested yeah
absolutely if you've been a big crowd
you should get tested
i mean we wish you hadn't been a big
crowd but if you were in a big crowd
absolutely i would i would try to get
tested look we put up on our web page
every day
where there's free testing um and
there's also other opportunities to get
testing but just from the national guard
there are opportunities every day
somewhere in ohio may not be
close to you but there's other places to
get get testing
um you know we've got drug stores that
are doing it now so yeah
i would certainly want to get tested if
i'd been in a big crowd
i mean it's just a it's a matter of math
and
it just you know the more people you are
around
and particularly if you're around people
for a longer time so you got two
variables
number of people you're around and then
the length of time you're around those
people
and uh you know so a big crowd big
political rally any kind of big event
uh you've got those things going against
you what you have going for you i guess
is
outside but we know that it while it
doesn't you know
it's better being outside than inside we
also know that it certainly can spread
outside and does spread outside
next question is from tom gallick at
gongworm
hi governor hi tom you yourself earlier
this year had a false positive test and
we don't know but it seems like maybe
some folks might have been
might have tested negative uh before the
debate and actually had uh coven 19.
are you worried that uh some folks
across the state might lose faith in the
efficacy of the testing system
well i don't know what kind of tests
were taken before people went into the
clinic
and um i know the white house did their
own testing
the biden campaign my understanding did
their own testing and then the
clinic was involved in other testing so
you're you're out of my
area there because i don't know what
kind of testing it was but i
did spend some time this morning as i
said uh
you know talking about the new strip
test antigen test
um that's coming to ohio and that we're
going to be deploying
and um i think if you look at the the
antigen test
as a test um
that you you know you would do
potentially much more frequently
that's that that is the idea with these
with these tests it is not the
final diagnostic test but it's pretty
darn accurate
um and so
we will deploy the antigen tests in what
we think is a strategic way to do it
with the understanding that they are a
different type of test
than the pcr test
governor next question is the last
question today and it belongs to
monica castro at whio in dayton
governor my question is are you
concerned about contract
tracing following the president's
diagnosis and on the potential impacts
it
could have on campaigning during this
election
well look i mean it's going to have an
impact on campaigning it's going to have
an impact on
what each one of us does
you know it human nature is
that if we know someone
that has had something happen
to them it has more of an impact than if
we
don't know anybody who's had that happen
and so in ohio we've had more and more
people
uh who we know fran i've had two friends
die
from the coba um
but if you know someone it has more of
an impact
well in the world we live in everybody
knows the president they may not have
met him they may not know him personally
but you see him on tv every day so
everybody knows the president
so i think that you know this what's
happened
tragically will get people's attention
and because they know the president it's
happened to someone they know
and that makes it more more real
i guess we're out we're out of uh out of
questions
thank you all and barring some
emergency we'll see you all on tuesday
at two o'clock thank you very much
[Music]
you
