uh
good afternoon everyone
wearing a cleveland indians tie today um
congratulations to the indians for
making the playoffs and
good luck against the yankees tonight
good luck
for the reds tomorrow against atlanta
congratulations to
both both ohio teams this exciting time
of year
i want to start
with something i've talked about every
week
and i'm frankly going to continue to do
that through this as long as it's
necessary to do it
and that is the tragedy of gun violence
where we have repeat offenders
violent offenders who have a gun and
they have no right to have a gun
this past week at least 20 people
in ohio died
last tuesday through yesterday due to
gun violence
seven days 20 people murdered an
additional 21 or more people
shot so another 21 who've been shot
there is legislation that has been
pending in the general assembly now for
almost a year
i think it's tougher on those
responsible for the majority of violent
crime in this state
and those are the convicted felons who
illegally
carry guns who doesn't want to get tough
against convicted
felons who illegally carry guns
right now many of these felons are not
getting
locked up when they're found with guns
current state law uh considers this a
lower level uh non-violent offense
uh oftentimes this results in in
probation
despite the fact that those who are
willing to break the law and carry a gun
are often the people who are willing to
hurt or kill with that weapon i'm not
blaming judges
um the law needs to frankly be changed
and that's what i'm proposing to do
let's look at a couple
of the victims
six-year-old marvea jones was shot
earlier this month
she lived for two weeks before dying
last tuesday
a little girl another child full of
promise
was caught in a crossfire when two men
started shooting at each other in
akron according to court records one the
alleged gunman was a convicted felon
prohibited from having a gun
he had allegedly had a gun he allegedly
used that gun and now another child
is dead another ohio child
here's another case sandusky
quadruple shooting in sandusky now
homicide after victim dies
suspect still on the loose
this happened on sunday four shot one
dead
sandusky police identified the man malik
aaron as the suspected gunman according
to public records he is a convicted
felon who is prohibited from having a
gun
sandusky police issued a warrant for his
arrest and warned that he should be
considered
armed and dangerous this man is still
wanted
he's out there on our streets and we
need to find him
i want to stress that everyone of course
is innocent until proven guilty
however if this is the person
responsible
there is no doubt that he would have
known that he couldn't have a gun
on at least two occasions the court
informed him in writing that he did not
have the right to carry a gun
let me read directly from the court's
entry the defendant is hereby notified
that under federal law
persons convicted of felonies could
never lawfully possess a firearm
the defendant was further notified that
if he is ever found with a firearm
even one belonging to someone else he
could be subject to prosecution by
federal authorities and subject to
imprisonment
for several years end of quote now
federal law is tougher
than state law and we have to change
state law to correspond
with what the federal law is
as i said if charged for illegally
possessing a gun under state law an
offender
many times will get probation
yesterday in cincinnati united states
attorney for the southern district of
ohio announced that they had federally
indicted 16 people
in regard to gun violence in hamilton
county and that is
great great news but the reason the
federal authorities
have to get involved with cases like
this is because of what i've been saying
week after week
and that is that state law isn't tough
enough on these criminals
and the truth is that there are only so
many of these cases that
authorities can take and so many times
our county prosecuting attorneys our
sheriffs our police
when they find someone convicted felon
someone who has committed a violent act
in the past who has no right to have a
gun
but is found in possession of a gun they
can't take those into federal court
because there's just
not enough ability to prosecute those in
federal court
and the federal prosecutors have to pick
and choose which ones to take
so we need to give our local prosecuting
attorneys our 88 county prosecuting
attorneys the ability
to take those cases now our bill does
not require mandatory sentencing we
leave it up to the judge
but this is a vast improvement it's an
improvement
of our law that mayors improvement of
our law that chiefs of police have asked
me
for and it's something that we really
need to do
we need to give our local authorities um
the ability the ability uh to
save lives and get these repeat violent
offenders off our streets
eric let's go to the data for today
today we're reporting 1105 new cases in
ohio
um that is above the average as you can
see
by looking at this we've been hovering
on around a thousand
of and for i'll say four out of the last
seven days we've been under
a thousand maybe maybe five of those
days uh but we are back we are up
today part of this is that the
collection of the cases just
it goes down and the reporting it goes
down on the weekend
so again we are now hovering right
around a thousand uh we certainly want
to
you know keep that uh that number that
number down
number of deaths reported 37
in the last 24 hours number of new
hospitalizations
106 in number of icu missions
third 13. so those numbers are up
we assume they smooth out as the week if
you take all seven days
again if you look at the 21 day average
this is something to keep
everyone to keep their eye on
eric let's go to the cases now ranked uh
as we've described in the past this
chart
takes the number of covet cases from
some in this case from september 14th
to september 27th and then makes a
calculation based on the population size
of that county to get the number of
cases
per 100 000 so it's not history it's the
last
14 days this allows us to compare
counties with different population sizes
so it's an apples to apples comparison
this is why for example franklin county
has the highest number of cases during
this period with 1
457 cases but is only 17th on this list
because they also have a much larger
population putnam mercer pike counties
come in
with the top three highest uh case rates
per
100 000. so these are the top 20 putnam
mercer pike wood athens shelby lawrence
henry
jackson defiance dark miami butler and
on down
on down the list
and what you see behind me now is the
entire list of all all 88 counties
uh and again we'll we'll talk more about
this
uh on on thursday when we give you an
update on the
uh color code but this ranking that
you're looking at now is just
one other way to look at it the color
code is more focused on
hospitalization and health use
with some early indicators built into it
uh
the data you're looking at now is just
straight numbers just straight how many
cases in the last 14
14 days i want to share a couple of
stories i've heard during the past
several weeks about the virus spread
every monday uh
7 15 in the morning we get on the phone
with all our 113 health
departments around the state and they
tell us you know what they're seeing on
on the ground
one example happened in one of our
larger counties
involved a group of 21 co-workers who
got together
two weeks ago and got together as a
group
someone in that group had covered 19
didn't know it uh now sadly 12 people
have tested positive nine additional
co-workers and three family
members of those co-workers so again
what we're seeing
many many times is not what occurs
necessarily directly in business or what
occurs in classrooms
but rather what occurs as people get
just get together
and we just you know alert everyone to
please be very very careful
about that here is another story i
learned of another story my call to
local health commissioners i wanted to
share a very very sad story
on august 28th the family in a more
rural county had a wedding
as a result of that wedding 11 people
tested positive
the bride and groom both got sick so did
parents and so did grandparents
a couple of weeks after the wedding one
the grandfathers of the couple
tragically passed away we tell these
stories not
because we want to tell them and we
don't want to
you know inflict more pain on anyone
it's just a heartbreaking situation
but we tell them so that other families
will won't have
the same the same heartbreak this just
occurs
when people are getting together in
groups and you're with friends or
the family and people just let their
guard down
that just it just happens
last week i said we would provide an
update on our wastewater monitoring
project
this is an exciting project and i've
asked
rebecca fuga to join us to talk about
this project
she is the assistant chief of the bureau
of environmental health and radiation
protection
for the ohio department of health she
has worked at the bureau for
25 years um
becca are you on there see if i can see
you okay
yes i am sir thank you thank you for
joining us we appreciate it
uh tell everyone why we are monitoring
wastewater and how that is working
okay so the ohio coronavirus wastewater
monitoring network
test wastes water for gene fragments of
cobin 19.
because people start to shed the virus
early when infected
a significant sustained increase in
these gene fragments found in wastewater
can be an early warning sign of a
pending increase in a specific area's
coveted 19 cases and could point to
possible hot spots or potential
community spread
having this information gives
communities an opportunity to act
proactively to prevent outbreaks and
you talk about early uh any idea how
early
this might be compared to when people
start you start seeing people with
with symptoms anyway
yes yeah go ahead research suggests
and our and our data indicates that we
start to see increase in cases anywhere
from four to seven days prior to
um and we start to see the increases in
the wastewater three to seven days
before increases in cases
and and how many cities are we looking
at that now
we're currently we've seen increases in
about six cities over the last several
weeks and most recently in three cities
across the state and and how many total
cities are being monitored now do you
know
we're currently monitoring 36 cities and
we plan on increasing
uh an additional 25 cities within the
next month
you and i talked earlier today and you
told me that this is kind of a work in
in
in progress and that you're
not only are you warning cities or
communities when you see something but
we're trying to learn some things as
well can you talk a little bit about
what we know
maybe what we don't know yet and what
we're trying to what we're trying to
learn
well what we're trying to do is we're
monitoring the viral gene copies
that we're seeing in the wastewater and
we're just starting to begin to compare
that to case data
within communities so that we can
confirm that we do in fact see this
as this viral gene data as a leading
indicator of disease
so we're closely monitoring the results
that we're seeing
across our state we're monitoring a
number of sites bi-weekly now
we'll be moving to monitoring all of our
sites bi-weekly
so that we are able to provide that
three to seven day leading indicator of
disease
and then when we see this information
when we see increases
we alert health officials and utilities
of any sustained
tech upticks in their communities and
we've provided a toolkit that helps
inform the public
and we're coordinating to help offer
pop-up testing and contract
contact tracing support for those
communities
i'm just most recently um we've worked
with several local health districts to
do this
and what districts have you worked with
i think you told me mansfield
akron yes um
as well as lucas county as well you
wanna just tell us a little bit about
about that sure um the toledo lucas
county health department has a pop-up
testing event planned and has notified
the community
through a press release about the
increases in their wastewater data
we've most recently worked with the
richland county health district
they've issued a press release today
regarding increases observed in
mansfield following the labor day
weekend
the increase in gene fragments in the
wastewater was observed about
five to seven days before we saw
increases
in the community so when the virus does
increase
in the community it can quickly spread
to impact other businesses and
facilities within the community
and then in summit county officials are
comparing our findings
with coven 19 case data for the area
served by the plan in akron so they can
better identify some of their hot spots
and areas of concern
so i i don't pretend to be a wastewater
expert um
when you do this let's say you're doing
a a
like lucas county is there one place
that all goes to
or or is there ways to actually see
where that's come where that's coming
from
currently in the monetary network we're
measuring the gene copies
in the raw wastewater that's entering
the wastewater treatment plant
so right now the data that we collect
reflects the community that's served by
the wastewater treatment plant
we do have the ability excuse me we do
have the ability to go into communities
and monitor in specific sub sewer sheds
within that community
we just haven't started doing that yet
within the network but that is a
possibility and it's been elsewhere
across the country
you know and i think you told me for for
lucas county
um it was it was actually organ is that
right
was not actually it was not actually the
city of toledo
exactly is that correct that's correct
it was in the suburb of oregon
okay very good um
as we move as we move forward um
are you going to expand the number of
sites
yes we currently have 36 sites that
we're monitoring that and we'll be
adding an additional 25 sites in the
coming month
okay all right we look forward to uh
hearing more
and uh and learning more thank you very
much we appreciate it
thank you for having me thank you
our ohio department of rehabilitation
and correction also recently began
conducting wastewater monitoring at
ohio's prisons
we've talked many times about how
challenging it can be
to prevent spread in any congregate
setting such as a prison
where a positive case in one person can
certainly have a ripple effect
director annette chamber smith is here
with us
on skype this afternoon talk about how
they're using waste water data to help
them and really also kind of give a
report on
covet in in ohio prisons and what the
department is doing
about that director thanks for joining
us
uh good afternoon uh yes we have been
interested in wastewater since about
june in fact one of the deputy directors
came
in with a newspaper article and was like
hey there's this wastewater thing and
we went to osu's environmental health
area and said you know is this credible
should we be using it and started
researching it
at the same time the u.s epa came to us
and asked to conduct
a study and so we said sure we would
love that so they started in june
collecting wastewater at one prison
and then a short time later osu started
collecting wastewater numbers in three
prisons
and what we saw was some correlation to
what was going on in the prison as
rebecca
just mentioned so we decided to test
every prison every week and we've been
doing that since the first week of
september
and what we're finding is there's a
relationship between
um what's going on in the prison and and
the wastewater and it
in the early warning aspect of it does
appear to be happening for us
i don't think we all have enough data
right now to say conclusively
uh exactly how many days it is but yes
it looks like it's about seven days
and that's precious time for us to plan
so
we use it as an early warning system and
so far we've been using it to do things
like
decide how many cohorts can be together
whether or not we're going to have
visiting just a whole host of decisions
that are made
that can make the prison safer if covet
is is going to be coming there
but now i'm putting out an executive
order
that will require staff to be tested
when
certain indicators like positivity of
staff positivity of the incarcerated
adults or the wastewater indicators
show that there's a problem with covet
in that prison we would not require
testing
if there's not any indicators but if
there is and
wastewater is a leading indicator that
happens before hospitalizations before
the cases come through testing
that would help us control things
because we know that
kovic comes into prisons from the
outside but once it gets in there it's
very difficult to stop it
so requiring staff to test at the point
where we know that that would be useful
that's what the executive order is about
and then every other prison will always
have
um staff being able to do voluntary
testing
so we're going to start the mandatory um
testing on
october 6 at only those sites that
trigger
you know these indicators and what's
wastewater is definitely an important
one because it is the only one that's
really a leading indicator
and you want to tell us a little bit
about um
what the protocol you you you told me a
moment ago about
what you're announcing today but what's
what's been
the protocol as far as testing how do
you how do you do that
so in the past we've tried several
different
methods of voluntary testing
such as having the national guard help
us test on site
in the parking lot setting up contracts
with local hospitals near the prison
so we since the beginning of coba we've
had different ways
for our staff to test as well as they
can take advantage of any of the testing
that goes on in the community
but to be frank with you when we have a
staffing shortage
and people are working double shifts the
last thing they're trying to do
is go somewhere in the community and get
a test or if they have to work their
days off
i mean we have a very hard working staff
they've been doing great work
and what we want to do is bring the
testing to the facility all the time so
they can get it
while they're on duty they don't have to
miss a beat
or take any other personal time to do it
so
we're really transitioning from just
like catches catch can
and using contracts in the communities
to
having it on site and the staff being
able to do it when when they think they
have symptoms when they're concerned
about exposure they can do it
and then also if we have a problem we'll
require it
uh you want to tell us a little bit uh i
think
we talked about mansfield we've got
some cases there i believe but maybe
just give us an overall
report of all the all the prison
facilities now you don't have to take
them one by one but just give us kind of
a summary
well we do have 79 staff members who are
currently positive for covid
and we have 266 people that live in the
prisons that are currently positive
three of our prisons make up the
majority of the positivity
that's richland correctional institution
which you just asked about
the correction reception center and
madison correctional institution those
three prisons have the majority
of the positive cases we have about
one-third of our prisons that don't have
covet at all not in their wastewater not
with their staff testing nor with their
incarcerated adult testing which is
great um
and then you know the next thing we're
going to be doing is
um flu shots so we want to make sure
that our staff and our incarcerated
adults
are vaccinated so that we don't have to
use
resources or have additional people sick
and
confusing flu symptoms with covet
symptoms
we don't want to be fighting on all
fronts so we're going to really try to
make
vaccinations accessible again we'll do
those on-site for our staff
we're partnering with a local provider
to come in do the shots at different
times different days and then of course
our
medical staff that work in the prisons
will provide the vaccinations to
all of the incarcerated people so the
multi-prong attack that changes with the
seasons
including an environmental aspect that
we've been pursuing
tell me a little bit i know you've been
doing some work about
air flow inside inside the prison
you want to talk to us a little bit
about that yes
in april our hvac experts
started changing the air circulation
between the fresh air outside in the
recirculation to have more fresh air
coming from outside
sometimes up to 100 if the system could
take that
just that was the beginning of starting
to look at environmental factors
after we'd already done social
distancing to the extent possible and
wearing masks and
gloves and you know washing your hands
and all the different things we do to
try to find copa that a person is
responsible for
we then turn to start looking at well
now what we can do with our environment
so that's how the hvac system started
working
and then we engaged an environmental
health specialist from osu
named dr weir and he has been working
with us to choose
ionization infiltration systems
those filtration systems are installed
at five of our facilities
and they're supposed to you know
obviously clean cove it out of the air
and osu will be doing testing to make
sure that they do
and if they do we'll buy more for more
facilities but
there's been a lot of magic beans during
cobin so we don't want to buy too much
of something without really making sure
that it has efficacy
but according to dr where this system is
the one that's most promising out there
so that would clean the air and we put
that in a places like where we have
high acuity people at those five sites
and we did that in april
and then in may um we changed out our
filters
uh to have the highest mirv rating that
that the system can handle um
so that's an additional filtration
measure
and now we're in the process of in
procuring
a portable air filtration systems for
additional filtrations
in places like the visiting area or
entry
or the medical area so we we're just
really trying to take care of
our physical plant as well because
you know when winter comes everybody's
going to be inside all the time and we
want to make sure we have the very best
chance we have
can have thank you very much
good good to have you on and we'll get a
report in a few more weeks but thank you
we now turn to the department of
medicaid um
since coming into office in january 2019
our administration has been evaluating
our medicaid program
department of medicaid officials have
traveled the state and they've spoke to
hundreds and hundreds of ohioans who
were covered by medicaid to better
understand
what their actual experiences with
medicaid have been
and what their health outcomes have been
we've also met with physicians hospitals
health care providers managed care plans
to hear
their ideas about how we improve the
delivery of health care
and the health of ohioans
from these conversations and this
process
we have developed a new plan a new
vision
for ohio's medicaid program one that
focuses on people
and not just focuses on the business of
managed care
a vision of what we hope will be a
better
healthier more productive state of ohio
this is the first major overhaul of
medicaid
in 15 years
in the coming days the department of
medicaid will be rolling out a series of
requests
for applications for managed care plans
to submit to us to help carry out this
vision
so this is this process will be rolling
out in the next few days
the department of medicaid is the
largest provider of health insurance in
the state of ohio
medicaid covers 3 million ohioans
of those nearly 90 percent are enrolled
in a managed care plan including
every nearly every child enrolled in
medicaid in the state of ohio
that's why plans do is a very important
tomorrow a new application will open
for those businesses interested in
providing managed care plans for
children and adults within the medicaid
program
selected plans ones that are selected
will be an essential piece in improving
the health
and lives of millions of ohioans
not only will selected plans work with
my administration
to build better systems of care but they
also play a special role in helping
their members develop good health habits
such as using primary care instead of
the emergency rooms
getting needed vaccinations and
attending prenatal visits for pregnant
women
they'll also help to coordinate care for
individuals with more complex health
needs ensuring
that patients see their specialists and
take their needed medication
medicaid's new program will focus on all
of the following
one improving care for children who have
complex
needs two it will emphasize
the personalized care experience of the
patient
three improving wellness and health
outcomes getting in front of the problem
focusing on wellness number four
giving doctors and other medical
providers more time to spend with
patients and patients having more
lengthy conversations with their doctors
i think that is very important next
increasing transparency and
accountability across
managed care to improve members care and
experience in making sure
all recipients understand what their
prescription drug
and their other benefits actually are
let me make one thing clear
if you're watching this and you're
currently covered by
medicaid please know that any changes to
ohio's managed care plans will not
disrupt your coverage or
your access to care
another announcement that i would like
to make is that the department of
medicaid will issue a second
managed care application letter later
this fall to specifically serve children
who have complex behavioral
health needs on any given day thousands
of ohio children
are living in treatment facilities
because they struggle
from severe mental illness substance use
disorder
or developmental disability sometimes
all three
sadly many of these children are from
ohio's foster care system
almost half almost half of teenagers who
are in foster care over the age of 15
live in a residential treatment center
children's experiences leading up to and
in the foster care system can leave them
with trauma
and other significant behavioral health
needs
in fact nearly two-thirds of all
medicaid spending on ohio's foster care
youth is for behavioral health
services showing that their mental
health needs
far outpace their physical health needs
for some youth their needs are so
intensive that we don't have the types
of care within the state of ohio that
meet their needs
in fact today 140 of our ohio's children
are currently receiving care
outside the state of ohio placing them
sometimes
far away from their families their homes
and their communities
clearly we're not doing these children
and other children in need of care
justice they and their families deserve
better
our new managed care program for these
children calling
ohio rise ohio rise risc
will work to build up evidence-based
care coordination
and behavioral health programs
throughout the state
ensuring access for more children and
better outcomes
for those children we certainly will not
see changes overnight this is a process
but we begin that process today and i'm
confident
that these new programs will help to
make ohio a healthier
more vibrant state
last week the ohio hospital association
launched a new
public awareness ad campaign encouraging
ohioans
to do the right thing to prevent the
spread of cobin 19. so we
thank the ohio hospital association for
doing that these public service
announcements are airing throughout the
state right now on both tv
and on radio both feature ohioans
ohioans who are coveted 19 survivors
the first is from cleveland state
university women's
basketball coach chris hillsmeyer
let's eric let's take a look at the at
the video
i was fatigued just like every other
basketball coach in march
but didn't think about getting sick i
woke up one night with the worst pains
and chills i'd ever experienced
i tested positive for coronavirus and
immediately self quarantined
i got worse and worse and checked into
the hospital
multiple times i said i don't want to
die
we know what works we know how to fight
this but it's going to take all of us
doing the right thing every single day
certainly a certainly a very powerful
message
what works of course is mask wearing
social distancing good hygiene
and just an overall willingness to do
the right thing for
others the next psa features stacy
unsinger a resident of ashtabula county
who says nothing could have prepared her
for what she went through with covid
19. i heard a lot about it
obviously but nothing prepares you for
when you actually get it
i started having trouble breathing i
felt like i was drowning
i went to the hospital and tested
positive for coronavirus
my oxygen levels dropped really low i
spent several weeks on a ventilator
it was terrifying i consider myself
lucky to be able to share
what happened we can beat this but it's
going to take
everyone doing the right thing every
single day
well we're grateful to have stacy
joining us today to tell us more about
her experiences with covid
if stacy looks familiar that's because
she joined us at one of our previous
press briefings i think in may uh after
a long stay in the hospital
uh and some of that time on a ventilator
it's been six months since stacy was
first diagnosed in march
stacy thank you very much for joining us
how are you doing
hi thank you for having me i'm doing
very well
that's great you look you look like
you're doing well that's that's
fantastic
um tell us a little bit about maybe kind
of walk us through the
the experience that you've you've had
well it started off and it was very
quick when it
happened diagnosed with double lobe
pneumonia
quickly progressed progressed into
having to be placed on a ventilator i
was in respiratory
arrest university hospitals
quickly sent me downtown to the covid
unit that was just open that day
and they saved my life
grateful for that beyond words
after i
was released from the hannah house i
came home on a walker
had to use a wheelchair for longer
distances
i quickly recovered from that
started walking and challenging myself
to
do different things started driving
recently i had a uh follow-up visit with
my pulmonary doctor
who in his word said my lungs look
better than ever
no scarring no damage very pleased with
that report
oh that's great that's that is
absolutely fantastic you got to be happy
about that
well very happy yeah yeah wow
wow tell us a little bit about uh you
talked about maybe the
physical side of this what about the
emotional side of this that has to have
been a scary
uh process and just
yeah what was it like well
well i will say the emotional impacts
for me with covid
um now looking back to everything
was the inability to comfort
my family and my loved ones they had to
see me
suffer and you know
as a lot of us know our our um children
look up to us
as like superheroes and i wasn't that
for them
i couldn't be that for them and that was
terrifying that was
scary scary to know that my parents were
terrified
that they were going to lose a daughter
at a young age
and just the inability to be in control
of the things that we think we can
control
yeah so you're i can't imagine how tough
it would be for you
nor can i really imagine how tough it'd
be for your your family
you said your parents and
other family members children just yeah
it's just got to be
and of course they they couldn't see you
during that period of time right or they
couldn't you couldn't really communicate
yes yeah you know just a few um
face timing from what i can recall
honestly my memory from that time period
is starting to
to be less and less and i'm grateful for
that
that's probably a good thing yes yeah
you you um um
i would just say have to have the
courage to do this psa announcement and
just
thank you for doing it but i wonder if
could you just tell us why you did it
that's got it had it been tough but why
did you
agree to do that well
i agreed to do it because i feel very
strongly
that people need to know this virus is
real
i know people are growing very weary
of the mandates and the masks and the
precautions that they have to take
because we've never lived through a time
period
that we've had to take these type of
precautions
so seriously so
i really wanted to participate in that
commercial
to encourage people
to not grow weary in doing what is right
because in the end
that mindfulness and that
strength of not growing weary
will get us to where we need to be but
we have to do it together
well thank you very much for doing doing
that and and
thank you for coming on today uh we're
very
uh very grateful and uh it's it's great
great to see you and great to hear that
you're you're doing very well
and that's just uh that's got to make
you feel really good i know
everyone who loves you and all your
friends have to feel great about that
as well so yes continued continued good
luck
yes god bless you thank you thank you
thank you god bless you
thank you very much

each each and every day
let me now turn to the lieutenant
governor who i believe is in
cleveland lieutenant governor how's
cleveland
uh governor can you hear me i'm doing
great i appreciate
the cleveland clinic hosting me today
that's where i am for
the news the news conference is indeed a
big day in cleveland you mentioned
the indians and the yankees playing
baseball tonight
there's another little thing that's
catching some national attention
probably some global attention
uh the presidential debate uh which will
be held at the cleveland clinic and i
will be there for that
so uh it is indeed a big day in
cleveland i appreciate the clinic
hosting me
uh for the news conference uh the a
couple things first of all
i want to i've had some questions about
this
about prevalence testing there's a study
that we did
back in july that will help assess
how many people we estimate have
had covid and how many people had it
during the
course of that testing we will give an
update on that on thursday so you can
plan for that
to come out on thursday i just wanted to
to respond to some questions that i know
people have
in anticipation of that information
being released
a couple of workforce related issues
starting out in july i announced that we
had uh
created an opportunity something we
partnered with the legislature on called
the
individual micro credential assistant
program assistance program called
imap for short this program
uh reimburses training providers up to
three thousand dollars
each for completed technology focus
credentials
uh and we will reverse up to two hundred
fifty thousand dollars
per provider today what i am announcing
is the opportunity for ohioans who are
low income
partially employed or totally unemployed
to access training
through imap at no cost even though it's
at no cost it has great value
believe me the opportunity this
opportunity will help nearly two
thousand ohioans earn a credential
and there are 12 training providers
including community colleges university
ohio
technical centers private providers and
non-profits
that have received awards to provide
these services
between all of those providers they will
offer up to 71 different
short-term industry recognized
technology focused credentials
that will help upskill ohioans uh in our
increasingly tech confused economy which
coveted frankly
has only uh has only highlighted
explain briefly how it works if you're
interested
you can visit the
imap.development.ohio.gov website
go over that one more time imap imap
dot development.ohio.gov
you will see the the 12 eligible
providers there
you can learn how to enroll then you
can select from one of
uh 71 micro credentials
that you can apply for 55 of those can
be done
online so you don't there are many of
them that if you have
coveted issues don't want to go in
person that there are
55 of them that you can do online of the
71 credentials
and we think that this has great
potential
i can tell you that what we like about
this is this is
pay for completion uh we're funding
things we want to see results we want to
pc people
leave with that credential in hand we
pay the providers
upon completion every one of these
credentials is in demand and we
know employers are hiring for these
skills today so
this imap program has
a tremendous value in the marketplace
and we're we're glad to get this kicked
off and get more people enrolled
uh governor and i will let you know i
got a i got an
email from a former academic advisor and
a former governor this week
to to ask you and me to make an
announcement about fafsa
uh and uh and i i um i know that uh
governor taft and dr leslie who had
emailed me
wanted to remind us that that um ohioans
that there's a free application for
federal student aid
known as fafsa that opens up on ohio on
october the 1st
all students high school seniors current
students
and adults interested in attending or
returning to college should complete the
fafsa
ohio families every year miss out on
financial aid
simply for not completing this form
it's estimated that approximately 39
39 of students eligible for financial
aid
do not currently complete the fafsa
that's 39
of students who are already enrolled
could get more financial aid simply
by filling out um these forms that would
leave tens of millions of dollars
on the table that people are not drawing
down to pay for their college education
uh and we urge um students starting
on october 1st families starting on
october 1st to get those forms filled
out
to help make college and your education
a little more
affordable and then finally governor i
wanted to
i wanted i know that you know covet is a
state-led
response every state all 50 states doing
things a little bit differently because
we have to have state level strategies
and i know we often ask ourselves
how do we compare what are other states
doing how do we compare
to to other states and there were a
couple of national media stories
yesterday that came out
that i thought provided a great
a great perspective on where things
stand from both an economic point of
view
and a health point of view and how ohio
fits into that
first article was a reuters story that
that led with the headline
positive covid19 test rates top
25 percent in some midwest states
so the midwest and a lot of midwestern
states are
seeming to see an uptick during the past
few weeks
highlighted in this article north
dakota's positive test rate
has averaged 30 percent over the past
seven days compared to six percent just
the prior week
and the positivity rate has risen to 26
in south dakota up from 17 in the
previous week
according to analysis done by the covid
tracking project
the article stated that all midwest
states except
ohio reported more cases in the past
four weeks
compared to the prior four weeks and
that was according to the reuters
analysis
also yesterday on the economic front
moody's analytics and cnn business
released a back to normal index this is
a
economic index which is comprised of 37
national
and and seven state level indicators
and the index ranges from zero
representing no economic activity to a
hundred
percent um meaning that they had reached
fat they
returned to pre-pandemic levels in march
ohio received a score of 88
uh we were ranked 10th in the country
for
the economic recovery these were led by
maine at 96 north dakota at 92 nebraska
rhode island and new hampshire at 90.
wyoming
idaho at 89 and then connecticut
michigan and ohio all at 88.
you'll notice from those 10 states only
two of them are really large
or really large states with a lot of
urban areas that would be
michigan and ohio the links to these
articles are on the social
on all of our social media pages i
wanted to get that out there because
um you know we always want to know how
we're working
as it relates to other states and and
while nothing is permanent
we know that with covid and much work
remains on both fronts on
economic and health front well we have
made progress and ohioans need to
they should feel good about the fact
that they've done this that they
that they have done a good job um
and for many months mount now we've
talked about learning to live with covet
in our lives and protecting our lives
and livelihoods
and the the data in these two articles
shown i believe
shows that that ohioans have hit that
balance
pretty well we know we always push every
day and i know
you lead this governor it's like we want
to get better on all of these fronts
um but i do want ohioans to to just know
that we appreciate how much
they are sacrificing how much they are
getting this right on
many occasions and and um
you know we we want to see uh continued
good news in this area
we'll continue to work at it we'll
continue to refine we'll get better
we'll innovate
um but i know that that uh we appreciate
what ohioans have done to put us in a
good spot on these two fronts
at least for now although we know that
no victory is won permanently it's it's
uh it's where we stand now and we'll
keep getting better
thanks governor well thanks for bringing
those up i had not seen
those so thanks for sharing and uh it is
as you said
lieutenant governor i think a tribute to
the people of the state of ohio we are
due to
are doing two things at once uh we are
focused on
health we're focused on keeping people
safe and we're also focused on bringing
our economy
uh moving moving forward so uh that's
good news thanks for sharing
we're ready for questions first question
today is from
tom bosco at wsyx in columbus
governor uh latest polls were showing
that ohio is a toss up four years after
donald trump won the state and of course
with the
debate tonight many are saying that ohio
is in play
for election day for the presidency
what's your opinion on that do you think
ohio is
in place still a swing state and what uh
case for reelection do you think donald
trump is going to make tonight
well i don't speak for the president i
support the president i'll speak for him
uh we'll we'll see what he says tonight
but uh
you know i think that um
if you know if you look at what
uh the president has done
a major commitment and this is
highlighted of course
by his nomination judge barrett
you know what candidate ever listed who
he's going to
put on the courts he did and uh
you know he consistently put people who
respect the constitution people who
don't think they're legislators people
who are are focused on being referees
which is what we want judges to
to be and so i think that is something
that
uh he should be very proud of i'm very
happy about
i'm happy about his his nominee uh judge
barrett
who you know from people who know her
uh who have worked with her people who
are on the left people on the right
um you know they all marvel at her
intellect
and who are more important even than
that is her honesty and her integrity
so yes i think president will certainly
talk about that
um is the k where's ohio uh
look i never bought into this argument
that ohio had become a republican state
i mean ohio is a swing state
um the president won last time by nine
points i think that was a big big
surprise uh
i think he's going to win uh this time
in ohio i think it will be close but i
think he will win
um so we'll we'll we'll see but sure
ohio is is certainly in in play and uh
i think the president will carry ohio
next question is from emily hamilton
at wews in cleveland
hi governor dewine um just going back
now to
our question last week we've been
reporting on
one nursing home specifically in lake
county but
i've you know started to receive
complaints and other relatives reaching
out
nursing homes uh from really across the
state and one of their main complaints
is that they really struggle to get
any information from nursing home staff
about their relatives and
and sometimes the last you know or the
only point of contact they get
is there toward the end when a hospice
nurse tells them that their
relative is contracted covered um
and it it won't be much longer until
they have unfortunately
passed away i guess our question for you
is what do you what's your response to
these families who say they're really
struggling to get
information from nursing homes what more
can be done to slow the spread at those
facilities and
what would you say to family members who
are calling for
some sort of state intervention aside
from
just inspections from the health
department you know such as
a lot of them calling for the state to
send in the national guard at some of
those facilities that they
they weren't sent into beforehand
well we don't we don't hesitate to send
to the national guard where the national
guard is is
is needed and you know we do check with
nursing homes if they have for example
we had one nursing home
a few weeks ago that
a lot of their staff was off they
couldn't staff it
uh and so for a day or so we had
national guard
in there assisting them so we will we
will send in the national guard we
we we have doctors we have nurses we
have people who
you know in their civilian life do this
and so they are members of the national
guard so we don't hesitate to do that
second as you may have seen the
president made an announcement
yesterday about new tests
antigen tests that are quick tests
and they are less intrusive
and they also can be directly read you
do not have to take them into a
laboratory to get them read
so we are looking now
and coming up with a plan that we were
working on today about how do we deploy
these tests i mean these could be up to
228 000 tests
every shipment and that could you know
that's going to enable us to do a lot of
different things that we have not done
in the past so we are looking
for example at you know making that
available
to nursing homes to fill in gaps where
the testing is not adequate
enough or it's not frequent enough with
staff for example
we are also looking at using these tests
as a extra layer of protection
uh but also to give some people the
nursing home confidence
that the person who's coming in to visit
a loved one
does not have cobia so if you could get
a test in 15 minutes
and we don't have this worked out yet
we're not ready to announce anything
we're working with nursing homes to to
talk with them and working with others
uh but there's a possibility that we
could use some of those tests
to enable you to see your mother uh
more often um i got a i got a
letter uh yesterday um that was i think
very eloquent from someone who's
directly involved in nursing homes and
and uh you know one things that she said
was
um you know when we have visitation
sometimes we're short on staff and we
can't we can't do it
and that's what slows the visitation
down and so i wanted to
i wanted to mention that let me just
finish that thought
um you know we have opened up the
nursing homes
we are now coming forward with a plan
about how do we deal with it
in winter how do we deal with in house
visitation one of the tools that we
are going to deploy i believe is this
additional testing
which will be of assistance the other
thing that you mentioned
that you know i want to talk about for a
moment um
is is the sanitation and following
infectious disease protocols
you know we are reviewing these again
internally to see whether or not frankly
are we doing
enough i always ask this question my
team are we doing enough in this area
are we doing enough in that area
so we're having another review of what
we're doing as far as the surveys the
inspections
that are going on in in in the nursing
homes so
go ahead you want the follow-up question
my next question is from joe ingles at
ohio public radio and television
hello governor joe hi um
many in our business community
particularly bars and restaurants
continue to say that they're having a
real hard time
making ends meet with the coronavirus
mandates and restrictions that have been
put on them
and they question why some states like
florida do not have the stiff
restrictions yet they uh the ohio bars
and restaurants
uh have to continue with um you know the
distance spacing and
and all of the things that that make it
harder for them
to quite frankly make money and stay in
business what would be
your answer to those businesses right
now
who are saying why can't you ease up on
this and give us some relief here
well i have uh family members going back
a
few generations who ran bars and ran
restaurants
and i get it i i understand that
i have close friends who run bars
and i understand it uh and so i know
this is tough
for them uh let me point out
one thing starting with restaurants uh
the restaurant protocol
was put together by people who run
restaurants
and one things that they said to me is
we do not want a limit we don't want
limit to how many people 25 percent some
states went to 25
some states went to 50 percent and they
said look we will
we will go by we will abide by the six
foot rule
but let us get as many people in there
as we can abiding by the six foot rules
now we did that now that obviously does
constrain to some extent and it would
vary by
the makeup of the room or how big the
room what angles the room has etc but we
followed what they asked us to do
uh in putting no 25 or no 50 percent
there's no
there's no limit on percentage it's
limited by
how close you can you can put you can
put people
um as far as the bars look i get it
i understand that uh 10 o'clock closing
with
alcohol off the table by 11 is difficult
um and gets into the directly in into
their bottom line
uh we're gonna we're gonna look at that
we are looking at that we're in the
process of looking at that
i have mayors of some of our major
cities
who told me as recently as this morning
please do not change that
i have other another mayor who has told
me please do change that
but we have a lot of mayors who who
don't think that this
we should change this um i can't compare
us to other states
i don't know what other governors are
doing i don't know what goes through
their head i mean that's not
you know my my responsibility my
responsibility is to the people of the
state of ohio and as the lieutenant
governor pointed out
you know we're trying to do two things
we're trying to live with the virus
we're trying to keep our economy moving
we're trying to get people employed
but at the same time we know that if
this thing
flares back up again then anybody going
to have restaurants or bars
because they'll be scared to do it we
can't let it flare up and i would say
and i'm bragging on the people of the
state of ohio we've never had a big
flare-up not a big one
we've never been like florida was at one
point texas was california was at one
point
um in south dakota you go on and on
go through the different states we have
not had that uh we've had great tragedy
we've had people like
continue to lose their lives we can't
seem to get the number under a thousand
by very much
as far as new cases every day we've got
hot spots certainly in the western side
of our state so it's not perfect
but we've done i think ohio ones
ohio ones because of mass compliance and
other things have done a very very good
job
at this what we constantly have to
evaluate
uh is you know exactly what you talked
about which is
hurt how this hurts small business
uh versus what you know what it does
if you expand the hours uh in regard to
potential potential spread so we're
looking at it
uh we'll be talking about that in in a
short period of time not
not today one of the points that's been
made very well from people
is uh hey you know the baseball playoffs
are on
uh indians are on tonight for example
you know nfl football's on a number of
nights
we have college football that's on and
so there's ample
opportunity for people to stay in a bar
you know
eat what they want to eat drink what
they want to drink and watch the games
that go on in
into the night and so i fully i fully
understand that
uh we will we will try to have something
shortly and kind of tell you where we
are on this as we
we continue to evaluate how we how we do
this
next question is from andrew welsh
huggins at the associated press
hi governor um apologies for the
background noise we've got a
construction project in the neighborhood
this is a bit of a follow-up to joe's
question and and this may actually be
more for the lieutenant governor
but um in terms of the economy we we did
see last week that initial claims for
unemployment compensation ticked up
slightly uh as did continuing claims
which are considered
i guess a more reliable indicator of the
jobs situation
and lieutenant governor talked about
some good news
but you know nationally 40 000 workers
in the airline industry are facing
layoffs thursday
uh just today the dayton daily news
reported that uh
pf chang's china bistro was laying off
299 workers across the state with
restaurants continuing to suffer
so i guess i'm just wondering with what
you've been talking about uh what you
just
talked about and what the lieutenant
governor has been talking about you know
what are your concerns that
as we've recovered from that huge
economic downward swing
we could be facing you know a longer
term decline
and again what can be done about that
short of additional reopenings
uh or a vaccine well
absolutely the right questions question
we ask ourselves every every day
uh we're talking to the legislature
we hope to have an announcement with the
legislature with the leaders
shortly about some specific help for
small businesses
and some specific help in regard to uh
people to pay rent uh which directly
impacts the people who are paying the
rent
but also you know someone who might own
the
own the property and who is paying a
mortgage themselves so
you know has a real significant impact
um
and second to people who have mortgages
so those are three things that were
we're looking at right now
uh talking to the general assembly and i
think
we'll be able to announce something i
hope in the in the in the near future
about what we can do uh in regard to
those those three things
um lieutenant governor i don't know if
you have anything to add to that
yeah yeah governor andrew it's a good
question
we certainly know that we have a long
way to go
but we know that finding that right
balance on the health and economic
consequences is essential to do
so that people have confidence to go out
to go back to work and to do those kinds
of things so it's it's the
it's the balance we're trying to strike
there's a lot of disruption in the
economy
where some types of traditional
businesses
are laying off and will continue to lay
off and i expect we will continue to see
those announcements
for some time as other businesses
are hiring uh for example i saw the
other day where amazon i think amazon's
trying to hire over 3000 people
in the state of ohio at the same times
that other types of businesses
perhaps who don't fit into the coveted
world as well
are laying people off there is an
intense disruption
that exists in the economy that's why
you hear
like we did today announcing about
retraining opportunities
because the types of jobs in our economy
are changing
and they will permanently in many cases
and so that's why we gotta
we gotta continue to upskill people
that's what the imap announcement was
about today
taking people who are unemployed uh
getting them retrained so that they
they can they can do uh a lot of the new
jobs that are being created and i want
to
i want to emphasize something when we
talk about technology
um these are these skills if you're not
if you don't consider yourself a tech
person believe me you can still be
retrained to do these things
the these are you don't you don't even
have to have a tech background
because to be able to enroll in some of
these programs and get a new skill so
please if you're out there in the
workforce don't be intimidated by this
i know that there's some support
services out there to get you skilled to
get you into the workforce
uh and for all of us to adjust to the
changes that are
in the disruptions that are occurring in
the economy a lot of these trends were
already underway coveted exacerbated
them
and we're just having to respond to that
and help
matching help get people skills and
match them to the new kinds of jobs that
are being created
thank you next question is from
jackie borchardt at the cincinnati
enquirer
good afternoon governor i won't have a
follow-up on the
abbott testing it's been almost two
months since
you announced the six-state compact to
require antigen tests
how come we don't have a plan yet on how
to implement these tests
with yesterday's announcements as you're
still working on it what is
what are you really um looking at to
uh to come up with that plan and why
what are some of the concerns about
using these particular tests
well thank you for the question uh first
of all you know this is
big news um this is separate and apart
uh you know from any consortium that
we're involved in
and we've known that these tests were
coming for some time as
the president has told us that they were
coming the vice president has told us
they were coming
so we know a lot of different places
where we're going to deploy them
and we have two goals we have two goals
uh
one is to save lives and that means you
have to target
those who are the most vulnerable which
are the older ohioans and ohioans who
have
a medical problem that's where you save
the lives
second though we have to do everything
we can to slow the spread
and to slow the spread um
that that is vitally important and so
those those two things third thing is
you know if we
can use these tests to let ohioans
uh more fully participate in
their life society
then we want to use them in that way too
for example
we were talking that we were working
this morning on about the deployment of
some of these tests
possibly into schools into the local
health department
so the local health department could
work with the schools
and again these are strip tests uh these
are these are look
some similar concept broadly as a
pregnancy test you don't have to take
them to the laboratory
it takes 15 minutes to get the results
so we're looking
we don't have anything to announce but
we're looking at how could we use these
to get more kids physically in school uh
maybe kids who are online now and maybe
some way we could use them in that
manner or
or when kids who are in school now
physically
and one of the candidly one of the
complaints we've heard and one of the
concerns that has
been raised is you know you have a child
who tests positive
and then you knock out a whole bunch of
other kids maybe there's a way
to use these tests in regard to these
other kids
so that they would not have to be
knocked out for 14 days
so you know that's some of the things
that we're looking at we're looking at
using some of these tests in our jails
you know our jails many times do not
have testing
and being able that's a congregate
setting it's a setting you worry about
they're either going to go back out into
society
you don't want them taking that out into
society you don't want them taking it to
the state
prison system so managing
helping sheriffs manage their jail
population certainly is
is important uh we also have
um other congregate living out there uh
that we could use and deploy these so
we're well on our way with the plan
we're not ready to announce it yet
we want to talk to some of the people
who are going to be deploying it
but we're very excited about this uh
this is a this is a big
big deal we've known it's been coming
but now with these additional tests
it's going to be very helpful
next question is from jack windsor at
wmfd
in mansfield hi jack hi governor
last week a marietta mom was violently
removed from a stadium
after she was asked to mask and didn't
comply
despite being six feet away from others
not in her family and having a medical
exemption
today the mother of a high school
student reached out to us
after she was told her son's medical
exemption was not going to be honored by
the school
and the school also questioned her
religious exemption
asking for documentation from a church
leader and materials that would
establish the existence of long-standing
beliefs essentially the school is now
adjudicating which religious beliefs are
valid
which are not so my question is governor
should schools simply be honoring
exemptions allowed in the sports order
and the statewide mass mandate from july
23rd
why or why not well we created the
exemption
um to take care of
seriously held beliefs that would
prohibit someone from
wearing a mask and it came about in a
conversation that i had with a
superintendent
where the superintendent said we have
people in our community
and you know they
for religious reasons do not want to
feel that they cannot wear a mask
that sounds that sounds reasonable uh
throughout this
we have we've tried to you know be very
respectful
of people's religion uh you know we
never closed the churches
we never ever ever did that at all
and so we put this religious exemption
in there
um you know we have 630 some school
districts we have private schools
and so each one of them you know has to
make a a determination
i can't make a determination in these
cases uh
i think our superintendents are doing a
good job i think our principals are
doing a good job and they're making a
case-by-case
determination of what you know
what they can do your question is you
know
what you don't want to have is a
situation where you
just say to people look if you just want
to say it's really
you know all you have to do is check
this box and you don't you don't have to
wear a mask
that's that's not going to accomplish
what we need to accomplish
we don't have to have everybody wearing
a mask
but we have to have a very very
significant
number of them and we've seen time and
time again
out in society out in different counties
that that does make a huge
you know huge huge difference
and so this is something i trust our
local
schools um and they have leeway in this
and we're not going to second
second-guess them we're not going to
tell them they were wrong
we tried to give them broad guidance so
that we could say to parents
and we could say to schools if you go
back in person
um that you the if you follow these
guidelines
this is it's the safest way that you can
do this
and let me just say they're doing a
bang-up job
they're doing a very very very good job
in managing a difficult
situation my hat's off to the
superintendents
the principals the teachers parents
i think by and large everyone is doing a
very very good job in a very difficult
environment
next question is from mike livingston at
gongwar news service
hey uh governor um you kind of alluded
this talking
about nursing homes but with colder
weather coming what other conversations
are you having with your team on how the
state's approach might need to adjust
once everybody heads indoors for the
winter thanks
well we don't know
you know where this covets going uh and
we continue to learn things i say we
look i'm not
i'm not the scientist i'm not the
medical person uh but i'm talking about
the experts and they continue to learn
um we're putting a real push on
flu shots because we don't know what
happens if someone has coveted flu but
we don't want to find out
and so the more that we can reduce that
number uh people who get
the flu the more that we can reduce the
severity of the flu
we know that that will save lives flu
can be deadly particularly to the young
particularly to the old
and so it's the right thing to do we
hope
that what they've seen in the southern
hemisphere some countries in the
southern
southern hemisphere where they've
already had the flu season
um that the wearing of the mass cut down
the spread of that but we
we don't know the other thing that we
are looking at i have a
working group uh and we've not talked
about this i don't think
but i put a working group together to
look at
um what our director
drc was talking about what annette was
talking about and that is
ventilation and you know what we do
in our public buildings and what we can
do
as people move back inside and they're
inside
virtually all the time the importance of
that ventilation
being right bringing in outside air uh
making sure you have the the right
filters in place
all of those things are very very
important we do have us
you know we had an expert from ohio
state who was talked a week or so ago
here
and we're consulting with him and we're
going to continue to work
on that so that's another thing that
we're working on
as we move into the colder colder
weather in ohio
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
hey governor max uh
so it sounds like uh that may was one of
the deadliest months for
opioid overdoses in ohio um
and moving forward i'm just curious what
what will your administration be doing
to try to curb that
make sure that we don't see another
record month here before the end of the
year
yeah we're putting a real focus um uh
with director
chris uh on on that and on
mental health uh many times those are
are connected uh we know that
um there's been a lot of downsides to
this covet
besides the coven and one of the
downsides
is an increase in mental health we're
again
working with the state legislature and i
hope to have some announcement
coming shortly uh you know in regard to
mental health and more that we can do in
this area to help our colleges our
universities to help our
high schools our grade schools i mean
fortunately
you know our k-12 schools have wellness
dollars
that the legislature set aside we work
with the legislature and they
did that so those wellness dollars can
be
used in regard to the in regard to
mental health but it's something we're
very aware of
we're seeing it out in the communities
getting more
dollars out to the local communities is
something that's
that's very important so we'll have more
to announce next several
weeks next question is from ben schwartz
at wcpo in cincinnati
hey ben hi governor
um i'm wondering if you've at all
considered loosening
truancy laws in ohio schools or
possibly requiring districts with kids
who are feeling ill
to offer the option of virtual learning
whenever they need just so kids don't
necessarily
excuse me so kids who don't necessarily
know if they have covet 19
but might feel ill don't potentially
spread the virus at school
well that's an excellent question we
really want to encourage schools to do
that
um and you know if if we're starting to
get into a problem
um i'm sure the schools are going to
tell us because we
in regard to absentee
um and there's something that we need to
do at the state level
in regard to that uh but by and large
this is we leave this up to the local
schools
again if there's guidelines or if there
are regulations that we need to change
because of the cova
that's causing that kind of problem then
i'm sure then we're certainly willing to
willing to take a look at that because
we don't want children who don't feel
good
coming to class uh and you know i
noticed that schools that have
done the hybrid one one of the things
that uh
they can do or most of them i think can
do is make that switch a little easier
back and forth
and you know hybrid means a lot of
different things to a lot of different
different schools but some schools child
it's on for a couple days off for a
couple days
but they get used to you know using that
that remote learning so again
i think those schools probably have a
easier time to make that
that transition but we're open to doing
anything we need to do to help them
next question is from kenny bass at wchs
in charleston west virginia
hi governor we've seen in our state and
obviously in eastern kentucky and
southern ohio that a one-size-fits-all
approach doesn't really work
when dealing with covid so can you
communicate to the people who live
in our region which is rural and in many
ways much more similar to kentucky and
west virginia than some of your more
metropolitan areas like cincinnati
cleveland
athens akron et cetera the differences
in governing this thing
in those areas and the challenges the
state is going through to try to
be as effective as possible in these
vastly different communities
well one of the great things about ohio
is we have many different communities we
have our appalachian communities we have
our cities we have our suburbs
you know different all kinds of
different uh parts parts of ohio
and um you know i've traveled ohio and
my wife fran has quite a bit in the last
30 or 40 years so
we we get it we get that we get the
difference i i think when you're talking
about a small rural county
we still have some counties that don't
have a lot of spread
one of the reasons we put this this list
up up on the board with 88
counties you know we can kind of see
everybody can look and see what their
spread is in their county on thursday in
fact
we're going to put some more data up
we're going to put for the month of
september
you know how how many people have been
coming out of cases
that actual number what the number is of
hospitalization so far
what the number of of deaths are and so
we're going to try to
continue to give people information so i
would say you know anyone who's in your
viewing
area should try to
continue to drill down what's going on
in their county
and how many cases they've had and what
kind of
report and we have we have the virus
everywhere so you can't hide from it
but there's certainly some counties in
southeast ohio for example
uh that are not as high as many many of
our other counties are but i think
people need to look at their own
individual county
um wearing the mask whether you're in a
rural county or urban county
is just a way to dramatically slow this
so if you're in a county where you don't
have a lot of
a lot of spread yet you can keep it away
i mean it's pretty simple eighty ninety
percent of people wear a mask you're
gonna keep it away
you're gonna keep it way way way way
down and it's so much easier to keep it
down
than when it gets up to here and it's
spreading out like it's spreading out
like that
and that's that's a problem so that
would be my message wear a mask
keep it down keep a distance
i think that's the best way to deal with
it governor next
question is the last question for today
and it belongs to shane stegmiller of
hannah news service
good afternoon governor how are you
doing um
the legislature sent you house bill 242
which prohibits local
governments from placing taxes on
containers such as single-use plastic
bags
you've expressed concerns about it in
the past
i just wanted to see what your thoughts
are on the bill currently and going
forward
because i believe it's just a temporary
ban
yes this is a temporary ban
and i will sign the bill because it's
temporary and because
i think you can make an argument for it
during the covet
period it covers for example styrofoam
people can carry out food etc
so it's not just the paper bags my
general principle
is unless there's a compelling reason
why we need uniformity throughout the
state of ohio
that we should stay away from
telling local units of government what
to do
they're elected by the local citizens
there should be accountable to the local
citizens
if the local citizens don't like what
they're doing they can get rid of them
um so if something uh
unless there's a compelling reason to do
it uh
i would normally veto this bill uh but
we are in the covent
uh period i think it makes sense during
this period of time
have that uniformity and that assurance
that people have this
um ability to you to use
styrofoam uh containers to have carry
out food and
to use uh the plastic bags so
i will sign the bill but
when i get another bill in a year or so
like that i probably won't sign it
i'm told that we are done and so let me
just do
uh something kind of fun i want to
spotlight
uh really some everyday heroes you know
them they're out there
uh maybe you're one of them but you
probably see them every day and they're
doing the best they can to get us
through this pandemic uh some of them
are shining light for others we call
them
heroes of hope uh here's one that we'd
like you to meet
abdul ali he is a hiring recruiter for
kroger
in columbus at their brewery district
store
he has hired 190 people since the start
of the pandemic
these are essential workers on the front
line
and we thank them for their service
let's take a look
hello how you doing today ma'am pretty
good thank you
my name is abdul ali i just love helping
people i'm a master store recruiter for
kroger located in the brewery district
columbus ohio how's your day going today
what i really love about being a store
recruiter is
knowing that i can change someone's life
in a second and just knowing that i have
the ability
to say hey you got a job
[Music]
we hired about 109 people since the
pandemic hit
most of the applicants that i have
employed um
were unemployed due to the pandemic
which was
some of the main reasons why you know
kroger was an option for them because
the other companies that they were
working for
as far as restaurants maybe bars salons
had to close due to the pandemic i just
appreciate and i value how much of a
family that we are
and how strong we are together during
this tough time
because we all are scared we're still
afraid but
i know in my role i wake up every day
and i tell myself
you know abdul you have a job to do and
there are people out there who are
relying on you
that need jobs hey guys how you doing
i'm here to help you out a little bit
there's not a lot of places that are
hiring
and i'm just fortunate that kroger
itself especially being an essential
business we're able to
not only provide the community with the
essentials that they need but also
we're able to employ people as well
during this time ohioans are
strong courageous and just fearless
hi jamie how are you

be strong to make it through this thank
you sir have a good day
