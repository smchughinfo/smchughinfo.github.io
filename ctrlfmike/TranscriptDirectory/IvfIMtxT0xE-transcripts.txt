[Music]
so
afternoon everyone i'm wearing a tie
today
from pelotonia the bike race in central
ohio that raises
money to fight cancer from the ohio
state james cancer center
this year instead of a weekend race
individuals can set personal goals to
raise funds for cancer research
and we certainly hope that next year the
race will be back
bigger than ever
one year ago today sounds of laughter
and music
in dayton's oregon district were
replaced with sounds of gunshots
and screams of terror nine people
nine people were brutally murdered
gunmen sprayed bullets into a crowd of
people
on the street that early early morning
nine people who went to the oregon
district to enjoy
a night out never came home
nine people who were fiercely loved
by their family and by their friends
nine people who we cannot and should not
forget today we remember them
and we remember the others who were
wounded
that early morning and all those who
carry the emotional scars of that night
we offer our most sincere thanks to the
heroic officers who ran towards
not away ran towards the danger
and they saved lives um
i'd like to pause now for a moment of
silence in honor
of those that were lost uh and in honor
of those whose lives have
been forever changed by that that
tragedy
thank you
uh for fran and for me this is still
a a very emotional memory
as i know it is for so many and the
emotions are
still raw for as long as i live
i will never forget going to the oregon
district that morning
along with mayor whaley chief
beale fran and myself
in seeing that crime scene
i'm an old former county prosecuting
attorney
i've been to a lot of crime scenes but
i've never seen anything
like this blood on the street
the food vendor's car it's still sitting
there
as if time had stood still
funerals then later that week a friend i
tried to go to
to most of them but just seeing
uh the loved ones who who were there and
mourning their loved one
we will never forget that
fran and i of course hold the miami
valley very close to our hearts
this is where we grew up this is where
we still call home
when the massacre happened it had only
been around two months since a series of
devastating tornadoes swept through the
area
causing a great deal of damage to a
number of people's homes
over 900 homes and and buildings
so it's been tough but the miami valley
is tough
miami valley valley is resilient dayton
is tough
dayton is resilient um and through all
this dayton
the gem city shines bright
the city of dayton sent us this mosaic
photograph
it's made up of contributed photos from
the dayton community combined into a
larger image depicting a prayer vigil
in the oregon district the following day
fran and i were at the vigil that night
i'll never forget um
trying to get through the crowd and then
going up to the
stage and climbing up to the stage and
then when you got to the top of the
stage i looked out and
literally down the street as far as you
could see as far as the eye could see
there there were people it was it was
just amazing
i can still hear uh the heartbreak
broken
and angry yes angry mourners
chanting do something do something and
rightfully
so they had the right to be upset they
had the right
to be mad they had the right to mourn
demanding that our state do something to
stop gun violence
the words certainly moved me and we
vowed to
answer that call we enhance safety
resources in the next few months
for our schools we invested hundreds of
million dollars
uh hundreds of millions of dollars in
mental health assistance
for our schools we offered grants to
help make our churches safer
and funding to help law enforcement
extradite dangerous
criminals further our warrant
task force work has led to 900
a 903 percent increase in the number of
arrest warrants
entered into the national warrant
database since march
uh 2019 a 903
percent increase uh when warrants
for dangerous warning criminals are in
these systems it significantly increases
the likelihood
if they try to purchase a gun that sale
will be stopped
i am convinced that our work in
improving the information that we put
into the national firearms background
check system
has prevented criminals from purchasing
guns and has in all likelihood save
lives
we are now building on these efforts by
developing
an e-warrant system to make the entry of
warrants
and protection orders into these
databases as
easy as possible lieutenant governor
will talk more about this system in a
few minutes
but it's critical that local government
agencies use this system
which brings me to legislation we have
designed this system
it will go into effect within a month
one of the counties where we'll start
this with 10 counties
happens to be montgomery county nine
other counties besides that
but we also need legislation to make
sure
that there is a requirement that anytime
a serious felony is conv
is committed a warrant is issued that
that warrant goes
into the national database as well as
the state
database in october we unveiled strong
ohio
a reasonable and aggressive package of
legislation designed to protect the
rights of ohio's law-abiding citizens
part of that bill as what i just
mentioned that requirement that
there's an outstanding warrant for a
dangerous individual that must be
entered into the national
database our bill would better protect
our citizens from those with a
propensity towards violence
it would better ensure that those who
are danger to themselves
or to others get help
and also it better prevents the sale of
guns to those who
are prohibited from owning them
today one year since the shooting one
year to the date since the shooting
took place that prompted our strong
ohio bill sadly
ohio's laws are exactly where they were
a year ago
ohioans are saying to the state
legislature
do something i'm calling on the general
assembly
to advance the strong ohio bill
we must not let the deaths of these nine
people be forgotten
nor can we continue to ignore the fact
that we have a generation of young
people who have been murdered on the
streets
of our cities on a daily basis
this brings me to another part of the
strong ohio bill a part that sometimes
forgotten or ignored and that is
gun violence that occurs on our streets
every day in ohio predominantly not
exclusively
predominantly in our major cities
we went back and looked at the figures
for this year
in ohio's eight largest cities in the
first half of this year
homicides have increased by a total of
27 percent
as compared to the same time period last
year
this year 246
of our fellow citizens have been
murdered
most of them by guns in our major
cities more than 80 percent of the
victims
were african-americans all were victims
all had a right to live
most of the individuals we know from
talking to chiefs of police and from
past experience
that most of these individuals who
committed these crimes
did it with a gun and most of them had
no
legal ability to own that gun
our strong ohio bill will impact
this in a number of ways one way
um is as follows
this bill will increase the penalty
for repeat violent offenders who use a
gun
in the commission of a felony or who are
found in possession of a gun
this is something that chiefs of police
and our major cities have been asking
for
for a number of years we asked the
legislature
please pass this along with the rest of
strong ohio
we simply cannot continue to let this
bill languish while people continue to
die
doing nothing doing nothing
is simply not an option
eric let's go to our data slides real
quickly
21 day average and you'll see the
the numbers uh are cases um
you can see what's happened with our
cases in the last 21 days
um yesterday 1143 cases
this this number has been hovering
somewhere between 1100 and 1500
for the last several weeks again the
deaths
tragically 31 individuals
hospitalizations
are up based on the 21 day average
as are icu admissions
i want to talk now about our our schools
throughout the state of ohio parents
students school administrators teachers
superintendents all are
thinking about going back to school and
the schools are making
decisions and parents are making
decisions about
how to go back to school
and i know that there is a great deal of
frustration
among ohio citizens today because of the
uncertainty
the lack of certainty
this weekend i spent some time talking
to scientists
around the country about the pandemic
one scientist told me this weekend and i
quote this virus
does not operate on our schedule
everyone i think feels frustrated by the
uncertainty of what
is ahead i certainly share
that frustration none of us has a
crystal ball none of us can tell
what's going to happen when we go back
to school
we all are trying to bring certainty to
something
that quite candidly we cannot be certain
about
and that is what's going on with the
virus
we've never been here before no ohio has
faced this for 100 years
we've not done this before
we cannot know what the next three weeks
will bring
let alone the next three months or six
months
or nine months of school
each school district in this state faces
a different reality
because each school district is in a
different
place different place because of their
buildings
different place because of what's going
on in the community
a different place because of the
community spread
that they have and how great that
spread is the reality
is and what scientists continue to to
tell me
medical experts continue to tell me when
we ask about schools we talk about
schools we try to get some certainty or
some
ability to predict what's going on what
i'm told
is that the community spread
in that community will be reflected
uh in in that school because it just
makes common sense
so there's really two variables one is
what the community spread is
and the other is what of course goes on
within the school
as we go forward the community spread
may change we've seen this with numbers
that we have we have shared with you and
we continue to try to
keep you up to date about what's going
on in in your community
and when the community spread changes uh
the school reality will change with it
we try to come up with the best
information that we can
to help provide parents who are making
decisions
superintendents who are making decisions
and others
about what's going on in your community
we've done a color code map the color
code map
eric is going to put up here in a moment
this is
the one we used last week we will change
this again on thursday we do not have
the new data computed
but this is gives people an idea of what
a general idea at least of what is going
on in their community and what
what the trends are we also have do we
have the other slide too
eric i've asked our team to
come up with another way of looking at
this
and this will make this available
this is a ranking of counties and this
will change all the time
but it tries to give some idea of what
is going on in the last two weeks
so it's not historical data it's not
going back it is
what one way of looking at how community
spread is
in that particular community in the last
two
weeks and so you get some kind of
interesting
things i'll see how good my eyes are but
uh what we have tried to do here what we
have done here i've asked our or people
who do the statistics of the department
of health and thank them for doing this
but what we're doing here is ranking all
88 counties
based upon in order based upon the
number
of cases
that they've had in the last two weeks
but we want to compare apples to apples
and so what we have done is
translated those numbers into a hundred
thousand population
so what you will see is you know some
surprises i think
um about and again this is only for the
last two weeks
next two weeks may change but it sort of
tells you
where things are going uh and eric i'm
gonna walk over here so i can
take a look at this a little better
but you'll see we start off
at least for the last two at least for
the last two weeks with the county that
has the highest number
per hundred thousand uh and that's that
would be i think a shock to most people
that mean mercer county
um small county western ohio
the next highest is lucas wyandotte
and franklin hancock champaign fairfield
ottawa
montgomery and on down again it's it is
simply one way of looking at this
but what it tells us is what what the
spread is
uh what the spread is in the community
at a particular point in time and that
is the last the last two weeks
it does not replace the
color code color code has a lot of
indicators
and the color code is more future
looking uh
than this but when people are making
decisions and
i'm not telling them how to make
decisions
or what decisions to make but there's a
lot of data out there
and i think what we know
is we all can impact
the school situation
our teachers our administrators
have worked very hard to prepare for the
school year and to make it as safe as
they can within the school itself but
it's incumbent upon us
to make sort of the sea that we all are
swimming in
as safe as we can and what is going on
in the community
as far as community spread will be
directly
impacted will directly impact what is
going on
in that school because those kids are
obviously coming out of
of that universe and if you see commute
widespread communities spread you will
in all likelihood see widespread uh
spread within that within that school
um look we all have different goals for
our kids
and our grandkids and teachers have the
goals administrators and mostly
but more than anybody else's parents we
all do
if we're gonna whatever those goals are
whatever goals you have for your
children
if we're going to achieve those we have
got to
deal with the community spread community
spread
is in fact everywhere as you can see by
this chart
with the chart we had up a moment ago
and these are the these are the the
top-ranked ones that eric now has put up
here
uh but take a look at all of them you
can see kind of where your county
uh come comes in
but the community spread will determine
how well we do
uh how well with if we start back in
school can we stay in school
uh if you start virtual will you be able
to move to
to in person all that is going to depend
on community spread um
we told the schools early on uh you got
to be flexible
uh and so they all have have come back
with with different plans
uh and again this this virus um
you know has a mind of its own and so we
have to be flexible but we can
impact uh what that future what that
future will
will bring again two real variables
community spread plus what is inside the
school and what's going on in the school
so let me move to
that as you know a few weeks ago
we gave broad guidance from the health
department and department of education
to all our 630-some school districts
throughout the state of ohio and there
really weren't a lot of probably a lot
of surprises in there
the only real mandate that we put in
there uh was that
as is true with every other company or
business
in the state uh anything else everybody
who works there has to wear a mask and
that was a part of the requirement
and that was consistent with what we had
done what we had done before
and that's what that previous order
we're going to add today
an additional order and we're doing it
to frankly give our children our
teachers
the best chance to succeed the best
chance for whatever dreams you have for
your child
whatever goals you have for your child
this academic year we are doing this
so that child has the best possibility
of achieving
those goals our goal must be to give a
safe environment for our children
safe environment for our teachers a safe
environment for the custodians
people who work in the office people who
work in the cafeteria
any adult who works there and all the
kids we want them to have as safe an
environment as as possible doctors
now advise that
children k through 12 should wear a mask
let me add to that
just this morning and i actually talked
to them at seven this morning
on a conference call the ohio children's
hospital association and the ohio
chapter of the american academy of
pediatrics
jointly now recommend mass for all
children returning to school
and here is a portion of the letter they
wrote in support of the mask and this is
actually the letter
itself and i will read from
a portion of this letter ohio children's
hospital association
supports the american academy of
pediatrics and the centers for disease
control and prevention's guidelines
for children's use of face coverings and
masks
the ohio children's hospital association
recommends all children
were face coverings masked when
returning to school consistent with
american academy of pediatrics
and cdc guidelines and specifically
children
in grades k-12 with the following
exemptions and the first is children
under the age of two
obviously it does not apply it's not
relevant to to
k through 12. number two any child
unable to remove the face covering
without assistance
number three exception a child with
significant behavioral psychological
issues
undergoing treatment that is exacerbated
specifically by the use of a facial
covering eg
severe anxiety or a tactile aversion
or a child living with severe autism or
with extreme developmental delays who
may become
agitated or anxious wearing a mask and
five a child with a facial deformity
that causes airway obstruction
um so that is going to be
the policy uh we are going to to make
that
an order from the health department uh i
have great confidence that the teachers
uh will work this out with with kids uh
but that this is what the norm
uh should be as you can see with the
exceptions if a child has a reason for
not wearing that
obviously that child needs to be
accommodated
and everyone needs to respect that child
so that's the important thing as we move
as we move forward frankly
this gives us the best shot that we can
along with the other things that schools
are doing
which is keeping the distance uh the
separation
working on that and added to that
the other things that they're doing in
regard to sanitation
gives us the best shot that we have
frankly to be able to have children
in in school
let's talk a moment about the mass we're
working with the federal emergency
management
fema to distribute 2 million mass to
schools for use by students and staff
we'll deliver these to the regional
education service centers who are
serving as our distribution partner
i'd like to thank them and fema for
their partnership as we try to make sure
schools and families
have access to the resources they need
to plan for the coming
school year let me continue
in regard to schools on another related
topic and that is sports let me just
talk for a moment then i'm going to
throw it over to the lieutenant governor
from personal experience all eight of
our children
have been involved in sports in school
our grandchildren
those who are old enough to go to school
have been involved in sports
we understand uh how very very important
sports
uh is is to children um and we all could
go through the list
uh of and john and i've talked about
this a lot uh
and fran and i've talked about it about
all the things that sports brings
a couple that come to mind i wrote down
this morning self-discipline
no substitute for that self-discipline
which will
bode well for that child throughout
their whole their whole life
but developing that self-discipline
working for a cause bigger than oneself
working on a team
you learn that you learn how to be not
selfish
but pull for the whole team and work for
that team that's a that's a
great lesson um sports brings order and
discipline to children's lives
uh sometimes children who might not have
that and
uh and i guess finally the thing i wrote
down this morning is the
the age-old expression what sports
teaches you is when you get knocked down
you need to get up and move on
and get back up and get back in the
fight get back in the game
so advantages
in regard to sports there is a great
frustration i know
among parents today about uncertainty
about school but also uncertainty
about sports might be uncertainty about
drama
might be uncertainty about band whatever
your child likes to do and whatever is
an essential part of that child
going to school there still remains
uncertainty
and that is something that is
frustrating to me
i know to the lieutenant governor and i
know it's very very much
frustrating to to particularly to to
parents
look we don't know exactly what is going
to happen
as we move forward we have been working
john has been specifically working with
ohio
high school athletic association working
with coaches
to try to get this thing figured out uh
we have provided
for the continuation of practice and
other things that are normally done the
thing we've not done yet because frankly
we want to get a little bit closer to
the date and see where this situation is
with the covid
we have not provided for the final go as
far as
fall sports particularly in regard to
contact
sports we want to get a little closer
in time to that before making any kind
of
final decisions we also know that some
schools
who are not going back in person going
online have made a decision already
not to go back in regard to to to sports
that is that's their decision um
let me now turn it over uh to the
lieutenant governor to kind of bring you
up to date
uh exactly where we are and to kind of
give you some
indication of where where we're going in
this regard and again i just would say
uh i share your frustration uh
we have to see where this covet is we
have to see what the situation is in
in your community and you have to see
that as well john
thank you governor i appreciate the
opportunity while we're on schools and
sports to to provide a little
clarification about where things stand i
know there's been some confusion out
there about what the rules are
we're going to go back through those
right now
and talk about where things stand first
of all in non-contact sports
non-contact sports have returned
to competition since early june
all sports deemed non-contact can
compete presently
this includes but is not limited to
baseball softball
golf volleyball tennis track and field
swimming
and cross country was recently added to
that list so these
have been operating and can go forward
on june the 22nd
we announced a return to practice as
being allowed for
contact sports but not competitions so
contact sports have been allowed to
practice since
the june 22nd
announcement those sports include but
are not limited to
football lacrosse basketball soccer
ice hockey and field hockey now on
july the 4th there was a temporary order
that was put in place allowing the
return for competition for contact
sports okay that was issued
but it was under very very strict
guidelines that included
quarantine period and mandatory testing
and that that order was renewed
last weekend by director health director
lance himes
there has been some confusion about this
in that the renewal of the order somehow
represents the plan for return to play
this fall i want you to know that's not
the case
that's not the case we are still working
with you with the ohio high school
athletic association
to finalize that plan and we are still
considering many options we're trying to
keep the options open because we want
we want student athletes to return to
play
we're trying to accommodate both the
health and the practical considerations
that must go in
to any decision for the athletes coaches
and fans we understand the uncertainty
in the anticipation surrounding the
hopefully forthcoming announcement of
that new guidance here in the near
future
and i can tell you as the governor
alluded there's nobody
in ohio that i think wants to get this
accomplished more than i do
we are working thoughtfully though to
make sure that we get these plans
finalized in the right way
um because i understand from personal
experience as a
as an athlete a coach a father
a competitor how important sports are
to the lives of of and development of
our young people
uh all extracurricular activities for
that matter they provide
the physical and and mental health
benefits that you get from them
life skills character skills
a constructive outlet for young people
teenagers especially in their lives and
and it's a source of hope we understand
that and uh
we're trying um very very
we're being very very diligent about
trying to get this accomplished for you
and we understand it's also worth noting
that in the past week we have received
the plans from
and had phone calls with the browns and
the bengals to discuss their
return to play season a return to play
this season i should say
while both teams are likely able to
return to competition under the existing
order that i previously discussed we are
reviewing their plans as it relates to
safely accommodating fans and that is
not yet complete
but it's a work in progress and then
finally
in this spirit of everybody wanting to
have a season
uh i want to highlight a video that we
have that we received
that was put together about the i want
to season social media
campaign this is coasters and coaches
and athletes
calling on each other to act responsibly
as it relates to
masks and distancing and slowing the
spread of the virus because they know
that slowing the spread is essential for
all of us to enjoy
this year's sports season so let's take
a look at the video we won a season
whether you're in the stands supporting
our student athletes on the field
track or court competing we need to all
do our part
and mask up
then we need to do our parts and wear
these
when we're out in public and in close
spaces i want to season
go bucks
hey guys hope you're staying safe this
is darius gone from the cleveland
cavaliers
and if you want to see the cows play
wear your mask
hello guys denzel award of cleveland
browns uh the team and i are looking
forward to seeing you guys in the
stadium this year so just want you guys
to continue to make smart decisions and
stay safe and
please wear your masks go brown
if you want this do your part social
distance or a mask
what's up bucky nation chase young back
in columbus
i won the season you win the season all
i ask you is to wear your mask
go bucks
today i'm sending a letter to ohio's
faith-based
community to share important health
information with our
churches our synagogues our mosque to
share ways to better protect
those who worship there this slide shows
the spread of the
virus to at least 91 different people
resulting from just one person with
covet 19
who attended a church service
it spread like wildfire wildfire
very very scary
we know that our faith-based leaders
want nothing more than to protect
those who come to worship we want to
provide our faith communities with all
the information we can from doctors and
health experts
to arm them with the tools to conduct
services safely
our religious faiths are at the core of
our great state
and our great country we thank our
faith-based leaders for all they do to
serve god
and god's people we've been very careful
throughout this pandemic to exempt
religious services
from any regulations and the only
exception to that is that we're now
asking
people who who attend church to to wear
a mask
but it's vital that to control the
spread of the virus
that any time any time people get
together
including for religious services that
everyone wore a mask
practice social distancing wash their
hands
and also while indoors make sure there's
good
ventilation and airflow so
we'll be sending a letter out with more
details to
to all our all our churches and just
asking them to to take a look at that
and trying to keep them up to date about
what the latest uh information that we
have
uh from from doctors in regard to this
we are continuing to have a spread
problem
of the virus because of informal
gatherings among
family and friends we all i guess need
to remember that just because it's your
family
just it's because it's your friends they
could still be carrying the virus
the truth is that it's easier to be
scared of a stranger
than a friend maintaining social
distance
and choosing to not gather for parties
or barbecues
might feel like you're not being
friendly but it really is a sign of
friendship
it is a sign of love um
it really says to that person not that
you're afraid of them
but that you want to protect them
protect them from getting ill for the
past few weeks i've been sharing stories
at this press conference about the virus
and how it preys on ohioans
i don't share these to cause alarm nor
to blame anybody
but i think sometimes they are
illustrative of
situations that we ought to try to avoid
i want to talk about a few of these
today
on my weekly call with our health
commissioners around the state
one of them summed it up well yesterday
just because you're related to someone
doesn't mean you're immune from catching
the virus
from them let me tell you about three
situations that we learned about this
week
in one instance his son lived with his
father who was in
hospice care at home for the two days
before his dad died
and not of not of covert but two days
before the father died the son was
coughing his family members came in
and came out of the house to pay their
respects to the dad
the son thought he had bronchitis
other family members though then started
getting sick
they were tested for the coronavirus out
of that family the father's brother
two sisters a sister-in-law and great
nephew
all tested positive
um a party with four attendees was held
at the great nephew's house
after that and someone there also became
sick and tested positive
since then two other people including a
child have tested positive in addition
to these people there are also
17 other contacts who are being
monitored
to see if they have the illness
in a different county there was a
wedding the brother of the groom
had symptoms but he attended the wedding
and reception
now today 15 people are sick including
the bride the groom
and the grandfather the local health
department is still investigating but
other family members also have gotten
sick
in a third county a bridal shower led to
six confirmed cases
in this situation someone who tested
positive attended the bridal shower
and the virus spread to several others
now there are six households impacted
by this outbreak none of us want to stay
away from our family
none of us want to stay away from our
friends
and it's natural when you go see them to
try to show affection or want to show
affection
but the virus is working uh please try
to remember that you're showing love
by protecting the other person and
protecting them means social distancing
wearing masks around even our family and
closest friends
to keep them safe and prevent the virus
from spreading
over the past week uh we've conducted an
average of about 22 000 tests
a day that certainly is up when from
where we were six weeks ago or so
we've more than doubled it but
we know that we have to continue to
increase that
we need these tests not just to diagnose
individuals but as a screening tool to
help control the spread of the virus
one of the ways to do this is by
expanding the use of rapid point-of-care
tests these tests are faster simpler
and less expensive than the so-called
pcr tests
that we are processing today in our labs
if we could scale up the use of these
rapid point
of care test they could serve as an
important screening tool and a critical
addition to our plan to limit the spread
of cova 19.
so i'm pleased to announce today that we
are entering into a multi-state
purchasing agreement
to expand the use of rapid point-of-care
tests
we have joined maryland louisiana
massachusetts michigan and virginia
to ramp up the use of this type of test
in order to
help detect outbreaks sooner with faster
turnaround times
expand testing in congregate settings
such as nursing homes
assisted living facilities and to make
testing more accessible for the most
high risk and hard hit
communities this interstate purchasing
agreement
with the other states demonstrates we
believe
should demonstrate to testing
manufacturers that there is a
significant
demand for this type of test and has the
potential to help us buy these tests
and associate supplies and are cost
effective and in a sustainable way
as new developments and testing
availability evolve we will continue to
pursue a variety of tools to help us
limit the spread
of coven let me now turn to
dr acton i want to give everyone
an update on our friend and our advisor
in june when dr acton resigned as
director of the ohio department of
health
i asked her to stay on our team as my
chief health advisor
in addition to advising me dr acting
took some time for rest
and reflection and also spent a lot of
time preparing for her role testifying
in lawsuits brought
against the state of ohio in fact she
has continued to do that
up and including this weekend when i
talked to her several times and some of
the people who
she advised me to to call i had the
opportunity to
to call dr acton told me
yesterday that she has decided to leave
state employment and return to her work
at the columbus foundation
which is where she worked before we
asked her to be a member
of our cabinet it saddens me for her to
be leaving
our office she has assured me though
that she's just
a phone call away or a text away and
she'll be available to continue
advising me and our office as we move
through this pandemic
fran and i again want to thank dr acton
for everything that
she's done for the state of ohio and for
the people of the state of ohio
her knowledge of and passion for public
health
helped position ohio as well as we could
be
as we face the early stages of kova 19.
her wealth of knowledge combined with
her calming
bedside manner helped many of her fellow
ohioans
and in the face of criticism she
remained strong
resolute determined and brave
as i have said before not all heroes
were capes
one wears a cape with a name on it
a white coat with the name on it of dr
amy acton
so dr acton we wish you well
we look forward to continuing to talk
with you and see you
in in the future thank you for all the
help that you have given
the people of the state of ohio
i'd like to introduce david reichert
who is the fire chief for the city of
fairborn in greene county
he's been with the fire department for
27 years
the chief is married to melissa they
have two daughters
madeline and caitlin that chief and his
wife recently had both had
coronavirus they've been recovering for
the past few weeks so chief thank you
very very much
uh for joining us and uh
how you doing absolutely thank you and
good afternoon and i appreciate the
invite
we're doing uh quite a bit better now
it's uh definitely been a bit of an
adventure for us
um uh we both uh became uh
pretty sick pretty sick with the virus
and uh it's been about a little over
three weeks ago
now we both have uh you know my wife is
a health care professional and uh you
know we've taken this seriously from the
beginning um you know for the perimeters
and you know the berries that we tried
to put in the place to
to uh you know to try to keep it out of
our household
from you know again we've been religious
without wearing our masks
as well as you know we set up a lot of
plants here on the department and uh
within the city
we try to set up a lot of perimeters uh
you know safety and you know we've done
it our same household and uh
unfortunately there was a gap somewhere
and you know the virus got in
you know my wife again as a healthcare
professional is very uh
adamant about cleaning and disinfecting
and uh you know
changing out of her scrubs before she
comes home but but it found its way
through
so but unfortunately we both end up
getting pretty sick with it
so you it looks like you're back to work
yes sir
second day back back all right yeah
how's your how's your wife
how's she doing my wife melissa is doing
good she's back to work today as well
and uh again you know like i said you
know we've taken this seriously we work
hard to
uh to you know to try to keep it out of
our
away from our friends and family as well
as uh um
you know inside of our home um
uh but again like i said earlier it's
just unfortunately it's made
it's made its way through so um you know
it
the thing with the virus that we've
learned is you know this has solidified
the approaches that we've taken here at
the city to try to try to protect our
you know our most invaluable resources
our employees but
um you know how the virus can be from uh
from the from you know having a virus
but without any symptoms to the point of
being fatal and
you know for us it it affected us pretty
good you know i think we
we both went through about every uh
every uh symptom that was on there
uh you know the thing with the virus it
didn't hit us all at once but uh
you know it spread itself out over about
three weeks
wow so so you were off uh off about
three weeks is that how long or
yes sir yes sir at about three weeks
again you know for us i can't think you
know green county health department
enough you know they've been a
a huge help for us but you know again it
was making sure that we were
symptom-free
uh you know obviously before we came
back to work and you know what we're
learning you know that
that varies from each individual that
that comes down with the virus but
unfortunately you know for unfortunately
for us you know it took a good three
weeks to really
uh get it out of our symptoms or out of
our system to ensure that you know we
definitely
weren't bringing it back to work uh well
chief thank you very much for sharing
your story we
we appreciate it and and best wishes you
and your wife and everything else you'd
like to tell
everybody what's that governor
anything else you'd like to tell uh yeah
absolutely you know i i definitely want
to uh you know uh
just give a shout out and talk about you
know the city staff here you know this
is this is a global
uh a global uh pandemic that we're
dealing with
you know knowing what to see you know
we've worked extremely hard from the top
from the mayor
uh city council uh city manager uh all
my chief staff as well as
you know local 1235 we've worked hand in
hand and we've done our best we've done
everything we can do
and like you had alluded earlier um
there there is no there is no
instruction manual with this um
you know we're learning as we go um you
know taking it seriously
we have to work together we have to work
collaboratively in order to get through
this
i think everyone has uh had their fill
of it and
is ready to try to get into uh to a new
normal
but i think that's exactly where we are
as a new normal but um you know
continued the
collaborative approach inside and
outside throughout the state throughout
the country to try to get through this
um um you know we have to work together
governor i appreciate the time to in the
invite to allow me to come on and talk a
little bit today about it
well chief thanks to you and the men and
women of your department uh for keeping
us safe
and uh thank you stay safe and thank you
for sharing that
with us we appreciate it very much
lieutenant governor very good
yeah um thanks governor uh
good afternoon again uh as the governor
mentioned earlier it's been a year since
the tragic
oregon district shooting in dayton that
hit us all pretty hard it was very
personal to me in the sense that i used
to work
in that same area for a period of time
in my life
and and we all keep
the victims in our in our
memories but we also want to use their
memory as motivation to get some things
done
and the strong ohio plan which the
governor mentioned
has many components but the innovate
ohio team
the department of public safety and
department of administrative services
have been working on one aspect of it
that the governor mentioned
that i want to dig into a little bit
deeper so you have the background on it
it's a technology solution that's why
the innovate ohio team is involved
and it's something that everyone should
support
the solution is known as e-warrant or
the e-warrant system
let me just briefly explain what problem
the e-warrant system solves
because right now if there's a warrant
or a protection order issued
it's a paper process it's a it's a it's
a slow paper process that requires a
second step
of entering the data into the leads or
the ncic
databases which which these databases
allow
law enforcement to know whether there's
a warrant out
for someone's arrest or a gun store
owner it allows them to know
whether a potential customer can
lawfully purchase a firearm
and since the shooting while we have
seen significant improvements in the
two-step paper process
of compliance we need to modernize the
system there is no doubt about that and
make it free
easy and mandatory this is important
because background checks are
only as effective as the information in
the system
and uh for a long time
it's for a long time i know all my
career second amendment groups have been
calling for this type of reform
uh in the area because it keeps out the
guns out of the hands of
the criminals without infringing upon
the rights of law-abiding citizens
for gun shop owners uh a streamlined
warrant protection order system would
improve their ability
to see all warrants and protection
orders in the background check
in real time and i know this i
frequently talk to gun store owners i
have one gun store
every time this happens he emails me and
says look
we have our 72 hours that we have to
wait before we sell the person a gun
the 72 hours comes and goes they get no
indication about whether or not the
person is lawfully allowed to own a gun
or not
and then weeks months sometimes never
they don't get the they get the
background check verification and it
shows that they should not have sold
that gun to the person because they
weren't legally allowed on it
this system is many holes in it it
doesn't work
and the e and the e warrant system will
help prevent this from happening
it's also about officer safety under the
current system a person could have an
outstanding warrant
and an officer in another jurisdiction
doesn't know that they approach a car or
or
a situation that could be very dangerous
because as they do the background check
they don't know the person they're
confronting actually has a warrant out
for their arrest and an officer
unknowingly goes into that situation
because there are holes in this system
e-warrant will help
fix that innovate ohio as i mentioned
has been working with
the team at public safety in
das to create this free
easy and mandatory system for all of law
for
law enforcement judges and clerks the
award phase of the project is done
and we're beginning the building phase
of this project
our team will begin uh working with the
first counties before the end of the
year
uh and we'll have our initial partners
go live in early 2021 so we're still
about six to seven months from having
this active
and it's worth noting it's worth
emphasizing again
this process this technology we will
take care of the technology side of the
problem but we still need action from
the general assembly
to make it mandatory as the governor
talked about earlier
without that important step in action
from the general assembly we won't have
a requirement that the data
be entered through the e-warrant system
uh and this
this is not a controversial issue uh
e-warrant
has been long supported as i mentioned
by second amendment advocates
and gun owners it's simply an
enforcement tool of existing
law and it needs to happen and we hope
the general assembly will act
before the end of the year and then
finally
a workforce development update workforce
training and development continues to be
a priority for our administration and
the presence of covet in our lives
continues to reshape the skills that
people need to succeed in the workforce
tech cred as i've talked about many
times tech cred
has been one of our strategic responses
to this
to quickly reshaping the skills of our
workforce
and the importance of this is
highlighted in our most recent
application period uh quickly a reminder
on how the program works tech cred helps
ohioans obtain
new skills by reimbursing employers up
to two thousand dollars for a tech
technology focused credential earned by
a current or prospective employee
uh the eligible criteria is it must be a
short-term program so we've got to earn
this in less than a year
it's got to be technology focused and
industry recognized
in the june application period which
which recently closed we saw a 101
percent increase in the credentials
funded from the january round
which was previously our most successful
period in january we awarded
1611 credentials well in june
3241 credentials were awarded
this demonstrates the demand out there
and how the technology focused
credentials are becoming more and more
important
302 companies have been approved today
that we're announcing with 3.4 million
dollars in funding
earning 3241 technology
focused credentials so far 695 employers
have used this interstate
a total of three or 7473
focused credentials have been earned and
we're announcing today the next round of
funding
for tech cred that will close at the end
of august you can find out more
information
at techcred.ohio.gov
and that's for employees employers and
and and service providers but the bottom
line is
with covid especially technology is
becoming more and more important in the
workplace
employers are really really
quickly trying to adapt with this by
upgrading the skills of their employees
and so please take advantage of this
program it helps create a situation in
ohio
where employers have the skills that
they need to compete
and employees have more job security
more earning power
and a better and brighter future for
themselves governor thanks john we're
ready for questions
good afternoon governor marty shladen
ohio capitol journal
at the same time dan mccarthy was
lobbying for first energy he was
president of a dark money group
that funneled millions of dollars into
larry householders dark money group
which federal law enforcement said was
integral to the biggest bribery scandal
in ohio history
knowingly or unknowingly doesn't that
make mccarthy a clear link in this chain
of alleged corruption
and how do you justify keeping him in
his in your administration
and also will he lobby lawmakers to pass
a replacement nuclear bailout
if uh hb6 is repealed
uh he will do what i ask him to do and
what i tell him to do as far as how he
lobbies
that's the way it works
look i i think it's always very
important
um in this great country of ours that we
not
uh you know leap to any kind of
conclusions or guilt by association
uh if you went back to what the u.s
attorney was asked
and i think you all asked him
collectively this twice
you know whether there's any connection
with the governor's office
and the answer the answer was was no
these 501 c 4
independent expenditures are perfectly
legal
uh they're used all the time they're
used by democrats used by republicans
they're used in every state of the union
probably everybody that ran for u.s
senate this year used them everybody ran
for
governor in every state probably used
them
so the mere existence of that
does not mean someone is guilty and
certainly far
far from it doesn't mean they've done
anything wrong so there's no facts that
would indicate to me
that dan mccarthy has done anything
wrong
if we see facts that anybody in my
administration has done anything wrong
we'll deal with that
that's not what we've seen
to ask him to lob confidence in him and
i think people who know dan mccarthy
uh known him for many years
believe that he is a man of very great
integrity
will you ask him to lobby on a
replacement bill
well i think i might look i i decide the
policy for this administration
and uh you know what we have said
uh is that it this should be repealed
uh and i will have further discussions
with the
senate president um larry abhoff
and with the new speaker and uh my
friend bob cupp
uh and we're gonna have those
conversations this week we'll talk about
a number of things and certainly this is
you know i want to get their opinion
about what should happen
after this bill is repealed
hi governor max philby with the columbus
dispatch um
it appears that we're going to be
nearing 100 000 cases in the coming days
so i wanted to ask you to reflect on
that and what it means
and then also we've heard from several
teachers as people prepare to go back to
school this week
several complaining that they feel that
the prisons have gotten more attention
in regards to covid than schools have
and i was hoping you could respond to
that as well
well that's not true look we have an
obligation to protect people who are in
our prisons and do the best we can just
as we have an obligation to pick
uh help our veterans who are at their
two veterans homes just as we have an
obligation to
protect anybody who's in a nursing home
and do everything that we can to help
them
uh you know when this this this started
uh you know we certainly did not have
the testing that we needed to have we
still don't have as much testing as we
would want
so you know we believe that
human life should be protected what we
did today
in regard to requiring that every child
in school
have a mask on is is something that will
directly benefit every teacher
superintendents have heard me say that
you know
and i know that they feel the same way
that they need to worry about their
teachers they need to worry about their
custodians they need to worry about all
the adults who work in the school as
well as worrying about the children
so mask up everybody mask on
is going to make a big big big
difference
any thoughts on the 100 000 cases as we
approach that this week
yeah i'm sorry um yeah it look it's it's
it's it's a mind-boggling number um
you know i think about the deaths i
think about the people who have died by
themselves
um i can't think of anything you know
worse um that's the there's many bad
things about covid but
that's certainly one of them um
the other part that we can't measure uh
frankly
or don't have good data on is in regard
to those people who have suffered
they've lived but they've gone through
hell
for a month or two months or three
months we can't really measure by number
those who have long-term medical
problems those whose organs have been
damaged
yeah this is not anything that any of us
expected
certainly when i ran for governor did
not have any idea that this was this was
coming
but i think about them and i look i i
also think every day about the other
people
uh you know who are out in ohio that we
need to do everything we can to protect
so then the people who have suffered
already
and the people who were trying to
protect none of that ever leaves my mind
never
hello governor karen johnson wlwt in
cincinnati
i'd say the likelihood of students in
kindergarten first grade wearing masks
all day long
is very low so are schools now looking
at either being the mask police
and teachers spending much of their day
forcing kids to keep the mass on
or open themselves up for civil
liability if someone gets sick
also does this apply to schools with
pre-k as well or is it just k
through 12 students
it's k-12 look
this is there is a
the jury is back on the issue there is a
broad broad broad consensus
among experts in this country that the
way to protect teachers the way to
protect fellow students is for everyone
who can
to to wear a mask
i have grandchildren that age and
i've had many children eight children
that age
i fully understand challenges
none of us want to have a mask on all
day
kids are kids look teachers and kids
will get this worked out
there's no police that's going to come
around there's no one going to look over
the teacher's shoulder or no one's going
to look over administrator's shoulder
but we have an obligation to take the
best science that we have and to get it
out
to schools and say to them this is the
norm
this is a goal this is what we would
like you to achieve
because this is the best science that is
available
and without a vaccine without a vaccine
we are limited in the ways that we can
protect people the state of ohio
protect their kids protect the adults
the other way is not to go back to
school at all and and some
schools are making that choice and
they're doing that based on
all the evidence and they make that just
they make that decision but the schools
who have decided to go back for them to
have a chance
a fighting chance of being able to stay
open with community
spread all throughout this state some
more than others but it's everywhere
it is a unanimous verdict of every
expert
every person in the medical field that
worry mass
provides that added protection and that
the distancing
and the masking look everyone's going to
need a break from the mask
teachers can you know handle that
however they want to kids go out and
recess
you know they can do something they can
do something different
they can take the mask off during that
period of time whatever you know that's
up
up to that individual teacher but we
have an obligation to put out what the
norm is we have an obligation to
to let everybody know this is how you
keep safe or
this is how you increase your odds of
staying safe
this is how you increase the odds of
parents being able to see kids actually
go back in into school and stay in
school
no guarantees but this increases our
odds
hi jim oddie from whio tv and dayton the
miami valley educators
want to ask this question does this new
mask order you are
issuing today for k through 12 students
that's that define the mask does it have
to be a mask
could it be a face shield and then who
sets the specs for this is that your
local
health department or your local board of
education what constitutes a mask that
would fall into this
well everybody you know should work with
their local health department there's
113 health departments they certainly
should work with their health
departments on many things
but again great leeway here you may have
some people
who for any reasons are more comfortable
with a face shield
the doctors who i had on the phone told
me this morning it's not as effective
as a mask but a face shield you know for
some people may be what
what is is the most appropriate again
not trying to micromanage this trying to
set set the norm
and as far as the mask look people can
could go on the internet they can look
it up some masks certainly
are quote better than others but i think
the
majority of the people in the medical
field who i have talked to
have basically said let's just say a
mask let's say a covering that covers
your
covers your your nose covers your mouth
and you know yeah some are better than
others and you can look that up and if
someone wants to get the best they can
do that
but the goal is to have the vast vast
majority of people in a room
who have some facial coverings on
and i think the consensus in the medical
community is let's don't
nitpick let's don't be judgmental uh
put something on and uh you know
i think that's that's what the goal the
goal should be you know it's it's
it's a situation gym where it's at the
cumulative impact
you know it's the cumulative impact of
what we all do
and and you know all of us putting
something on
and look i you know when i talk to the
medical professionals i
call upon my own experience with kids
and what kids can do and what they can't
do and look
if for some reason it doesn't work with
the child it doesn't work with with the
child but the
point is that the vast majority of
people in that room
they can have a mask on it's going to
give them protection is going to protect
protect the other children you know
we we know that schools are facing a
challenge
this is not easy it's not easy to have
the distance
it's not easy on a bus to have the
distance
so these are challenges these are not
easy things at all
so we got to do what we can do and and
and do the things that we can do that we
know will make a difference
and that are actually doable and this is
something that is doable
hey sir christian hauser with local 12
news out of cincinnati
for the past couple of questions you've
actually actually talked about the
importance of mass and how
students k through 12 will be wearing
them well right now there are many that
aren't the athletes that are practicing
aren't required to wear the masks or
follow the social distancing guidelines
while they're practicing right now
so how do you envision being able to
come up with guidelines
for sports when you you said it yourself
that masks and social distancing are the
keys
how do you find a balance between those
and and sports
well it's like everything else in life
you have to try to find a balance you
have to find something that works uh
you know you have to try to figure out
what your goals are what you're trying
to achieve and then how you can
best achieve them so there's no magic
formula work you know
to to how this to how this gets done but
i think having the norm and having what
the goals are
uh you know look there are some
certainly sometimes
athletes would certainly be able to have
a mask on that may depend on the sport
but certainly there's opportunities for
that certainly when
athlete is going on a bus to to cross
country meet or whatever it is certainly
the athlete could have
could have a mask on these are things
that have to be worked out
we we don't have our our final orders in
regard to
sports yet and but that certainly are
things that we
will take into consideration but it's
look it's it's all a balance it's all
trying to figure out
what you practically can do and still
achieve whatever the goal
the goal is i mean let's let's take a
teacher in a classroom
if there's some reason you know that
that that teacher because the age of the
kids or other things
you know cannot wear a mask maybe there
isn't maybe a face shield
will work part of the time and this
people can adjust to this
but i think if they know mask is the
norm
mask is the best face shield is is a
maybe a backup
people will figure out how to do these
things and uh
you know they will by not wearing masks
that's the first part is that risking
these athletes safety by
not forcing them to wear masks
put out a final we've not put out a
final order on that i know john you
won't say anything on that or not but
clearly when you're in the midst of
competition you can't wear a mask that's
what makes
competitive contact sports difficult
right now when participants are not on
the field
they're supposed to socially distance
they're supposed to
follow all those protocols that's what
the hashtag i want a season is all about
it's about helping young people
understand that if they want to
participate
if they want their teammates to
participate if they want to have a
season
they have to own these responsibilities
to make sure that they're protecting
themselves the coaches have to re
to enforce these things so that they can
have a season this has been
effectively working by and large in
non-contact settings
but we know that contact settings are
more difficult
that's why it has been a challenge to
come up with
the proper protocols to do these things
but we are working daily
with coaches with the athletic
association
to make sure that we can provide a safe
environment for those student athletes
and and coaches as possible
good afternoon this is jackie borchardt
from the cincinnati enquirer governor
earlier you mentioned certainty in
relation to schools
several schools are starting in the next
couple weeks you haven't ruled out a
state order closing schools
at what point or by what metric would
you take that action
well we're not contemplating doing that
i mean look
the pathway to go to school this year
and to make it
um and to be
back in school um it's not gonna be easy
uh the covet is here we know that uh but
the best shot that we have at doing that
is if if we do two things
one is we control the environment in the
school the best we can
and what we announced today while maybe
controversial
uh is based on medical science and that
is that if the kids can all wear a mask
teachers all wear a mask custodians
everybody wears a mask
we're going to be a lot safer in that in
that building
so we know that the other thing that we
can control
um without a vaccine you just you're
limited to what you control
the other thing we can control is
community spread
collectively we can control that this
virus cannot go from one person to the
other unless we help it get there
and so the wearing a mask and the
distancing is vitally important
i made a big point uh last week and when
when we put up the map statewide map uh
looking at the number of yellow yellow
counties and then we looked at how many
of those yellow counties had turned
orange
and what i said was look you know if we
want to control this community spread we
can do it in these small counties
but we've got to get on it and we've got
to have more people we've got to have
more people wearing masks
so my message today you know if you're
in a smaller county
and what we've seen is in our urban
areas and
and most of our suburbs we've seen the
number of people the percentage of
people wearing masks out in public has
gone up dramatically
we have not seen that as much in our
rural areas and so
if we want to get kids back to school in
the rural areas if we want to have
sports
again it's what we do in regard to
retarding
community spread and the way you do that
is by distance and by masking
so these are the two variables that we
are that we are playing with
two variables that we can impact uh and
it's it's up to all of us uh what we do
every day
um you know what the odds are that we're
going to be able to you know have kids
in school
as of today you do not have plans to
that look we've learned what works
we know that masks work
and what you're going to see from
schools
is that they're going to be doing some
are going to be doing five days a week
some are going to be doing a hybrid
model some are going to be doing
distance learning
and none of us know what to expect from
any of those situations because we've
never been through it before with covid
we will all learn from what's going to
happen in the coming weeks
and and schools and families and leaders
will be able to adjust
uh to what we see happening on the
ground
and and at we know as we learn as we get
more information
we make decisions that that uh address
those
uh the situation that we confront i just
also say jackie that
you know what goes on in individual
school the people who are in that school
are going to know it first
and frankly they're going to make the
first decisions
you know we hope we have no incidents
but we know with the covet virus out
there there will be
um there will be some spread there will
be some in school and we just know that
and so those i think it's so very very
important
for those schools to have a plan now a
plan now
about what they do and i know i'm
talking from superintendents they're all
working on that or already have a plan
they're focused along with the local
health people the local health
department
what do we do if we have a problem how
do we isolate what do we do
and so they all are look looking at that
but you could envision a situation
where you got a problem with because of
sports you got a problem because of
who knows what and schools will make a
decision
and they'll make it long long before
we'll make those decisions probably
because they're on the scene
and they're the ones who are directly
accountable and are seeing what's
happening to their kids and to their
the adults in that school system that's
where you're going to see it first
adrian robbins nbc4 uh governor dewine
dr fauci said the u.s needs to get a
hold on the virus and get down to 10
000 new cases a day by september do you
think it's realistic to think that here
in ohio we could be down to somewhere
around 200
new cases when right now we're seeing
well over a thousand
in just months with the current orders
we have in place and
do you feel that same urgency to get a
hold of the virus before flu season and
cold temperatures
send people back inside in this kind of
timeline we're on
well thank you for the question uh look
there has to be a sense of urgency
what we found with the virus is you
don't turn it on or turn it off
overnight
and you know the steps that we are
taking are are incremental
uh but they're pretty uh you know strong
steps
uh with the basking statewide with the
masking in all the schools with the
masking with all the students
you know cutting the bars down to 10
o'clock there are other certainly other
things that we can do
but in spending the weekend talking to
experts from throughout the country
you know the majority of people
that we talked to while being very
honest and saying we can't predict where
this virus is going
but most experts when you talk to them
are concerned about what happens exactly
what you said
when winter comes what happens in winter
at the flu season
in addition to the flu season you know
you have
you have the coven you have people
moving back inside
one of the things john talked about how
much we've learned in the last four or
five months
one thing we've learned is how very very
very much
danger more dangerous it is for for
people to be inside than outside
and particularly if they're in a crowded
room the more people in the room
and that's the recirculation of that air
so that is a very dangerous thing it's
one of the
reasons candidly that you know
schools should really really really look
hard
at getting their kids outside as much as
humanly possible
you know we've got tough ohio winters
but our september's and our
august and september's and and october
is they're not
too too bad in fact they're lovely and
so thinking about how to have class
outside
thinking about how to do other things
outside for the kids it is so much safer
there's a study that was just
completed uh indicated it was 19 times
more dangerous to be inside
uh than outside uh and so that's a
that's a that's a part of reality that
we can we can have it have an impact but
uh
look we've got to get these numbers down
uh if
if the scientists are right and winter
is going to be tough
you know we can't go into this winter
with these high numbers
we're making some progress we're seeing
our positivity rate go down
it continues to go down slowly uh
which is which is a good thing and we're
seeing some of our early indicators go
down the other side of that is we're
seeing spread out into our rural areas
we're seeing spread virtually throughout
the state of ohio
which is very worrisome
hello governor kevin landers wbns 10 tv
i am the last question of the day
uh the order you signed on august 1st
the health order stated that athletes
need to be tested 72 hours prior to
competition
was that intended for high school
athletes and do you believe
testing should be mandated prior to
competition
and also president trump will be in
cleveland on thursday for a fundraiser
are you concerned at all about that
gathering
thank you
well look i'm always concerned but
anytime anybody gets together
if that is an inside event i don't even
know if this is an inside event or an
outside event
i think it's the shorby club um i just
don't know
um so you know he always would worry but
i you know
going to assume that they're taking very
very very good precautions
as far as the order uh
you're right as lieutenant governor
indicated it was not intended for high
school students
that was not intended we just continued
an
older order people looked at that and
got understandably upset
about it look
testing when you if you're trying to
keep covet out of some place
or outside a particular group the more
testing you can do
the better we don't have the ability to
do
that kind of massive testing today now
obviously if you did have the ability to
do it
then that would be up to the individuals
if they wanted to be tested and be up to
up to the schools where they could
actually even do that we don't have the
capability of that today so it's not on
the it's
simply not on the table uh to do that at
all john
you want to add something yeah i would
only add that that in talking with some
of the testing people
who work on this every day due to the
supply of testing they're not even
recommending testing
asymptomatic people and and so that's
not that was not what that was intended
for
we look forward to seeing everyone we
will have a close here in a minute but
in case i forget just announced we'll be
here thursday but it'll be at three
o'clock
thursday at three o'clock our friends at
nationwide and the memorial tournament
are helping us as we close today to
encourage everyone to keep up
uh the great work i want to thank all
ohioans for the great
battle that you've been carrying on
thank you very very very much
uh these pga tour professionals are
helping us amplify this very
important message so let's take a look
ohio is open but the fight against covet
19 isn't finished wash your hands
keep your distance and wear a mask
[Music]
we'll see you all thursday thank you
very much
[Music]
you
