[Music]
afternoon everyone
well we certainly had some good news
yesterday morning uh
moderna with their drug trials
proceeding very well 95
pfizer the week before so that's very
very good news help
is truly on the way for us in ohio and
across
across the country so very very very
good news
the bad news is that our situation in
ohio is deteriorating
we see more and more cases more and more
people in the hospital
and we've got we've got to turn turn
this thing around
we literally have to build
a bridge to get from here to
the point when we're going to have the
immunity
uh from the vaccine so we got to get we
got to get over this we got to get over
this bad
bad spot i'm going to talk today about
some of the things that
we can do uh it sounds like reports i'm
getting around ohio we're already
starting to
to do that more and more people are
wearing masks and retail
outlets which is just great great great
news
so let's um eric eric is back
good to see you eric let's take a look
at
the numbers let's go to today's slide
uh seven thousand cases this has been
running between
seven and eight thousand uh for about a
week
um six weeks ago we were
at about a thousand so it's gone up
dramatically
a number of deaths sadly at 30
hospitalizations uh way up 368 we'll
talk about hospitalizations in a moment
those people in the hospital
21 day average was only was 210 and icu
admissions is up
a little bit as well let's talk a little
bit
about hospitalization
october 13th we had a thousand people
in our hospitals in ohio who had covet
november 5th that number was 2 000.
by november 12th that number had gone
from 2 000
to 3 000. and you
look at today's number 3648
so this is just as you can tell
going up dramatically you'll see
that the yellow is the icu
and that's going up certainly as well
and you'll see
covered positive hospitalized is the is
the purple
so just a dramatic dramatic change i
spent yesterday
traveling around in some of the
southeastern parts of the state as well
as the northwestern part
of ohio i had doctors with me to stop
and each one of them described what they
were seeing in their
in their local local hospital uh
let's let's uh the icu let me give you
the icu numbers
um one month ago we had 280
of our fellow ohioans in icu uh
today we have 900. so a dramatic
dramatic uh increase of those in that
in that situation so eric let's take a
look at the next one
this is our slide of course 88 counties
ranked by highest occurrence and again
as you'll see every single county
every single county is now a high
incidence
and these numbers continue to go up even
for the counties that have the least
if you spread here makes county for
example
still these are high these are high
numbers
every every county in the state is at
least two times
the high incident level set by the cdc
eric let's look at the
top 20. and if you look at the top 20
these are astronomical numbers
you know if you look at the top five
putnam mercer allen lake all glazed
um it you know these numbers are just
um shocking it means that one out of a
hundred people in the last two weeks
i was diagnosed with coba so
just think about the odds and we know
that's always lower than
not everybody's diagnosed not everyone
has the test
and so what that means is that
dramatically increases the chance of
someone in those
counties running into somebody who does
in fact have the coven and again it's
it's the reason for the mask
it's the reason for the for the
distancing
all right eric let's take a look at the
next slide this is something we've shown
before
i believe this is cases versus testing
this shows
we're very happy to see the testing
going up and it continues to go up
but it a number of cases is going up
much more
obviously much more dramatically so we
have some people who think that the
increase in testing is what's causing
the increase in cases
yeah a little bit of it but most of it
uh is
more and more cases um so let's take a
look at the next
slide here um so this is number
number again test perform and you can
see these numbers are going
way way up we're happy certainly happy
about that
and the positivity number the seven day
running average is 12.8
positivity uh the last day was 13.8
so certainly not heading in the right
direction
so let's talk a little bit uh about
building that bridge to get us
across until we get uh to the
point when we start uh not only getting
start getting testing out
or excuse me getting vaccinations out
but get them out enough so that we're
starting to get that
herd immunity so it's a ways away but
the good news is it is coming
and it's great great news that we got
this weekend in last week
what was started down that path last
week uh with our retail mass order
uh we had uh inspectors go out yesterday
for the first day again our goal
is to protect the workers in the retail
establishments
also to protect customers when they when
they go in
it's the right thing to do with every
county now being
hot every county now having very
significant
spread the good news is that we have had
some reports that even before monday
when it started to be enforced uh we
were starting to see
a number of case number of people who
are wearing masks in retail
establishments
uh go up and i got some emails from some
folks who have been
in in these different retail
establishments and some of them so
that's great we just encourage people to
continue
to do that we issue reissued last week
the uh order uh that people should not
come together uh
you know ten or more people
that has to do of course with what
wedding receptions and and funerals
uh again not impacting the wedding
receptions or the weddings themselves
the ceremony
nor the funerals but uh the receptions
getting together the order simply says
that it has to follow
basically the restaurant protocol
there's a few additional tweaks in there
but it's basically people need to wear
masks when they're not actively eating
they need to be seated they need to be
careful
and we think that will help when people
follow that as well as we've seen a lot
of
a lot of tragedy come out sadly out of
out of weddings and out of out of
funerals and spread coming
from from that what else can we do
i i think really if we could summarize
what we need to do
it's we're a mask and have fewer
contacts
uh what do i mean by that well think
back to the spring uh
we did some shutdown people stayed home
not looking anything that drastic
but we know that if we reduce
the number of people we come in contact
every day with
that we reduce the chances of getting
the virus
and we reduce the chances of spreading
the virus if we unknowingly
have it you can look back um
in the spring or you can look back in in
march april uh and you just saw activity
went down and we're not talking about
closing any businesses as we did then
but what we're asking every ohioan to do
is to limit your activity limit your
contacts
with other ohios so how we going to do
that
we are issuing a curfew
in the curfew uh we'll start
thursday uh at 10 p.m so the curfew
every day
for 21 days we're gonna try it for 21
days see how
how we're doing um for 21 days three
weeks at
10 pm uh retail establishments
need to be closed and people should be
home
that will run until 5am i know a lot of
people like to get up and exercise
and do things that's great um
we believe that this is going to help
it's going to reduce some of the
contacts that are taking place
um what else what else can be done can
be done
so i'm asking in addition to the curfew
itself
i'm asking each ohioan every day
to do at least one thing that reduces
your contact
with others or one thing that enhances
your
personal contact with someone
your emotional contact with them but not
a physical contact
what what are we talking about let me
give maybe some examples that i just
wrote down today
you're thinking about going watching the
ohio state game with a bunch of friends
don't do it pull back watch watch
that at home talk about it on the phone
skype in if you want to talk back and
forth about it but
but pull back um
we're a master church again
um something that people can do
call a friend just talk to a friend
uh lord chris is going to talk a little
bit later
today about some of the mental health
toll that's going on during this
pandemic and what people can do to
to alleviate that something you can do
write a letter
write a letter somewhat people like to
get mail they don't get
a handwritten note very often give them
give them that
again something positive that we can do
during this time something we did back
uh
in the spring we consolidated trips um
talking to someone the other day uh they
said you know
in the spring i would have made one trip
to the grocery store
yeah this week i've made two maybe three
um so you can buy the same amount of
stuff
we want to help help the merchants uh
but
make a list consolidate it these are
just simple things everyone can come up
with their own list
so i'm i'm really asking and we're
asking every ohioan to do
one thing at least or two or three that
cuts down the contact
every single day ask what you can do
for your fellow man that's what you can
do
for the people of ohio and we are
all in this together and what each one
of us does will make a difference
we don't have to cut these contacts down
by as much as we did in the spring but
if we can cut it down
say 20 percent 25 percent we're going to
have a significant impact
can you couple that with what we really
didn't know
in the spring and that was that these
masks work really well
and so you couple the mask with that
a couple of the cutting down on the
number of contacts
and you know that's going to go a long
way
to keeping our hospitals from being
overrun it's going to go a long way to
keep our kids
in school it's going to go a long way to
keep our
loved ones who are in a nursing home
safe
i will now go to
our chief medical officer of the ohio
department of health
dr bruce vanderhoff doctor thank you for
joining us uh and you're officially on
the team and so thank you very very much
for this
uh the good work that you're doing i
know that you and i have talked an awful
lot we
we talked some before you took the
position but we've been talking a lot
more
since you took this position so give us
a little perspective from a medical
scientific point of view about what
we're seeing in ohio
right now and you know maybe some of the
things that we
should be looking to do and what the
significance of all this is
well thank you thank you governor dewine
i'd like to
share information about really two
things
the science of covid19 and how our
hospitals
are handling all this first let's turn
to the science
at the beginning of march when covid19
first arrived in ohio
we didn't know much about the virus and
the disease it caused
this science has evolved as the virus
has spread across the world and
today our picture of how the disease
progresses
is much more complete what we know
is that this disease is spread mostly
through the air by respiratory droplets
when we cough
sneeze sing talk even when we breathe
we expel virus droplets into the air
if an infected person is having a
conversation in close proximity to
another person
or coughs or sneezes next to them
we know now that that second person is
at real risk of being infected by some
of these
airborne droplets fortunately
what we know today is that there really
are
simple things each and every one of us
can do to protect
ourselves from these droplets we can
maintain a good distance say six feet
from those around us and we can wear a
mask
these are simple and yet very effective
non-pharmaceutical interventions that
accomplish
three things they protect the person
you're interacting with because the mask
limits your respiratory droplet
spreading and keeping your distance
makes it harder to share the virus today
we also know that the masks
protect the wearer from being on the
receiving end
of another person's respiratory droplets
and there's now scientific evidence that
if you're wearing
a mask and yet still or infected you're
less likely to get
sick than if you weren't wearing a mask
i also want to comment on the importance
of good ventilation
as we shift to being more and more
inside
we need to look for ways to ensure good
ventilation when we're around others
so if you're going to be inside around
people who
aren't in your inner circle consider
cracking a window
in addition to wearing a mask the
science is
absolutely clear keeping your distance
wearing a mask and good ventilation all
work
together to form a protective barrier
against viral transmission it doesn't
matter if you feel fine
or you just have a mild tickle in your
throat
you could be asymptomatic and still a
carrier
be able to infect the people around you
even if you feel absolutely fine
that's why it's crucial that each one of
us
wears a mask when we're around anyone
who
isn't in our immediate circle
now as the holidays approach these
protective measures
are going to be even more important
it's obviously not possible to wear a
mask while you're eating or you're
drinking
which is why we're recommending that you
celebrate small this season
keeping your celebrations to the inner
circle of people who live in your
household will help protect you
and your family now i'd like to turn to
our hospitals
something that's important for us to
know as we
think about and talk about covet 19 is
the trajectory of this disease and how
long it may take for someone to get
sick sick enough to end up in the
hospital
say for example i was infected with
covet
on monday it could take three days for
the virus to make me sick enough
to start showing symptoms then
it could take me another couple days of
feeling lousy
before i decided to go to the doctor
assuming
i got tested and the doctor
gave me a result and that result came
back let's say
fairly quickly in 48 hours it could take
another couple of days of feeling badly
before i got sick enough
to say you know i need to go to the
hospital
once people get admitted to the hospital
we need to be aware that
they aren't staying a short period of
time
we've made great strides in the
treatment of combat 19 and those
advancements have in fact
reduced hospital states a lot
nevertheless even with these
improvements
a person who gets admitted to the
hospital for covet 19
typically will stay several days and if
you're sick enough to end up in the icu
especially on a ventilator your length
would stay could be weeks now if you've
never
seen anyone who needs a ventilator for
assistance with breathing
you should know that it's not an easy
road
it can take a long time to rebound from
being on a vent
it's grueling and requires a long
recovery
even after you're breathing on your own
again
i speak directly with my colleagues in
healthcare around the state
each and every day and what they're
telling me is that the situation
is very serious as we look around the
state
every county is being impacted there's
no relief valve
there's no place where the virus isn't
transmitting at a high rate
a month ago we had a thousand people in
the hospital
at any given time today that number is
more than
3 600 and it's growing considerably
in the spring we focused our efforts on
conserving
ppe and building physical capacity
the space and the stuff for our health
care system
we were successful and we're in much
better position today
to help support our hospitals through
this surge
however we now face a different kind of
crisis
it's the people it's a staffing crisis
our caregivers are in a precarious
situation
they're at risk of illness because of
their exposure
or their family's exposure outside the
hospital
as a result of these outside the
hospital exposures
some of those people some of those vital
nurses and
other medical staff may be quarantined
or may become ill themselves
many of them have been treating covet 19
patients since
march and they're just exhausted
let me leave you with this thought
we all need to do absolutely
everything we can to contain the spread
of this virus
we're at a critical juncture we need to
protect our health care workers
i spoke earlier about the trajectory of
the disease
remember that even if we make necessary
changes
immediately it's going to take us weeks
before we start seeing any real
improvement
in those hospital numbers even if you
don't believe
in masks please wear one
keep your distance from other people and
reconsider your gatherings
to protect our health care workers
they really need us now more than ever
doctor thank you very much thanks for
being with us
great to have you on the team department
of mental health and addiction services
director laura
chris is next and we're going to skype
her in
and lori uh you've talked to me a lot
about uh what we're seeing out there
with
people and their mental health needs i
know that as i've talked to
other people across the state we're
seeing that as well maybe you can
help us a little bit about how to get
through this and maybe help
family and friends get through it yeah
thank you so much governor for having me
back
i appreciate your attention to our our
physical health and our mental health as
ohioans and i know that so many others
do as well
this pandemic is definitely creating
prolonged stress
for all of us and if you're feeling
stressed out you're not alone
it's okay to not be okay and it's okay
to ask for help and these are things
that
you've heard me say before you've heard
the governor talk about before
and it's true we've established an ohio
care line
so that if you want to talk to someone
about your stress you can call
1-800-720-9616 to connect with a mental
health professional 24 hours a day
and maybe you don't want to have a
conversation
you'd rather just text with someone
that's available too you can text the
number four
in the word hope to 741741
and you can chat via text either way
you're connected to
a mental health professional that's just
going to walk you through
answering questions that you have
listening to your concerns connecting
you to resources
or information in your local community
maybe you
don't really need to talk to someone yet
but there are still healthy ways for
each of us to think about
adapting to adversity during the
pandemic and
these are pretty simple things that each
of us can do
but they do take some attention on our
part to make sure that we're
taking care of ourselves so the first
the governor's already talked about this
uh
staying emotionally connected to people
that we care about each day
reaching out to a friend or a family
member with a phone call
it helps us feel better as the person
making call and it's always great to get
a phone call from a friend too get a
little bit of fresh air a little bit of
sunlight a little bit of exercise each
day that gets a little harder in the
colder months in ohio
especially the sunlight sometimes but
getting outside
and even if it's just bundling up and
taking a walk around the block
or doing some stretches inside near a
window these are good things for
us physically and then the other thing
i'll just mention quickly today
is prioritizing time for your
spirituality or your faith
spending some time in meditation or
prayer
is something that can really help with
managing stress too
so again these things sound simple and
it's easy to move away from
any one or all of these things on a
day-to-day basis especially if we're
dealing with financial struggles
or missing loved ones during the
holidays or
supporting a school-aged child
during the the learning from home
but research shows that these coping
strategies will help each of us deal
with adversity
and they help each of us build some
confidence in our skills
calmness in our mind and perseverance
when we're starting to feel the fatigue
of the pandemic
and it taking place over months and
months so remember taking care of
yourself
is a priority not a luxury
and now i just want to take a minute to
talk to our friends and family
and neighbors who have been
struggling with or recovering from a
mental illness or substance use disorder
maybe starting before the pandemic
please keep up with your treatment
keep up with your medication stay
connected to your support groups
if you run a facility that hosts a
support meeting
find ways for that meeting to continue
in person
in a safe way if possible and if not
look for ways
for people to connect virtually through
social media meetings or or other
connections
these support meetings are life-saving
so stay connected to your peers
they'll help you when times get tough
also we know that no matter how long
someone's been in recovery from a mental
illness or a substance use disorder
relapse can happen under prolonged
stress and so the pandemic is certainly
something
that can threaten relapse for our
friends and family who are in recovery
let's make sure that none of us are
making assumptions that we're checking
in with our friends checking in with our
families who we know have struggled with
addiction or mental illness in the past
invite these family members these
friends into our inner circle into our
bubble
to help them find ways to be safe and
help support their wellness from
profit 19 but also to reduce
opportunities from being alone and for
having a substance use crisis
without support and and that could
include an overdose
ask your friends and family who are in
recovery if they're okay
encourage them to stay connected to
treatment and support
ask if they need help getting what they
need and if they do
then there's resources available you can
go to takechargeohio.org
or you can again call the ohio care line
at 1-800-720
these are simple ways that each of us
can commit to supporting
ourselves and one another every day
during the pandemic and
and beyond and remember taking care of
yourself is a priority not a luxury
well director thank you very much all
good comments very important comments
you know for example if someone is in an
aaa group
what you're saying is try to figure out
either how to physically continue that
maybe wear masks do something or do it
do it uh
on online or somehow keep that
connection
is that that's right that's right there
are a lot of
peer support groups family support
groups that are continuing in person
maybe there's fewer people they're
sitting further apart they're wearing
masks
uh the meetings might be shorter so
don't assume that a meeting is not
happening reach out and find out but
also
online there are a number of meetings
available
and there are organizations that are
hosting those and and they're private
and confidential and
secure as well great well thank you very
much
thanks for the great work you do and
your team and
folks around the state of ohio we
appreciate that very very much before we
go to lieutenant governor
maybe just a couple more comments about
the curfew because i'm sure people are
saying well what
what all does that mean again ten
o'clock to five to five o'clock in the
morning
um basically want people
not to be out but there certainly is
always always exceptions
it would not apply to those who need to
go to work during those hours or those
who need to be
out for any kind of emergency purpose
curfew is not intended to stop anyone
from getting
groceries or getting a meal from carry
out or drive through
or or delivery curfew is not intended to
stop anyone from going to a hospital
obviously or or seeing a doctor or
getting help
or treatment for medical or mental
health conditions so just kind of common
sense
our idea is to kind of carve this time
out and we know that if we all do it
with some exceptions
but that in and of itself will reduce
some of these
contacts that are that are going on so
lieutenant governor
we'll turn it over to you thanks very
much governor
uh last part people need to pay
attention to that it's just common sense
and lori and bruce are great a lot of
great advice there
uh and you know i've had lots of
conversations over the last week from
people who offered
opinions and advice and and uh and i've
just tried to to
put it in perspective for them we've
heard a lot of statistics it's always
hard to know which ones to use but we've
had we had it took us five months to get
to our first hundred thousand cases
and we had a hundred thousand cases of
virus spread over the last three weeks
that puts in perspective about what
we're confronting now and
and i know uh the governor and and
bruce alluded to this but over the past
21 days hospitals
as a result of that spread have seen the
increase from around fourteen hundred
patients to over thirty six hundred
and as a result some of those hospitals
have had to slow
uh have had to accommodate this
increasing numbers by
slowing uh postponing um some elective
surgeries and
and we just can't see this trend
continue without it having
uh a really increasingly negative impact
on the way that our caregivers provide
that care
and so doing nothing is not an option
uh it's easy to understand why though
because i've had a lot of these
conversations it's easy to understand
why
targeted shutdowns of businesses um
like restaurants and phys fitness
centers were were for some
considered pretty unpopular and they
didn't consider it
a fair solution because those businesses
and the people
who rely on those paychecks would bear a
disproportionate
responsibility of the burden when we
know we all know this
that the responsibility for the solution
lies with all of us
personal responsibility and
accountability and shared responsibility
we don't need a shutdown but we do need
to slow down
for a few weeks to get this virus
back into a manageable situation
i often hear people asking for this
balanced approach
as the best approach and our challenge
now is how do we reduce the spread of
the virus
not overwhelm our hospitals keep
businesses open
save jobs educate kids avoid the
unintended consequences
anxiety and stress and mental health
issues
addiction and abuse those things that
lori chris talked about that can wear on
us
this is the complexity of the problem
that we're trying to
resolve and of all of the options we
discussed
with business leaders health care
community leaders
legislators school leaders a 21 day
temporary curfew was considered the
least
disruption of disruptive option to our
economy
but also believed to have a meaningfully
positive impact for our health care
providers that's the balance
and the majority of the opinions of the
people we talked to
felt the approach the governor outlined
today would be the best
way to go the virus spreads when people
get together
so for a while we need to make sure that
fewer people
are coming together and spreading the
virus
no shutdowns just a slowdown
this has been hard on everyone i've
talked to sons and daughters who've lost
parents to covid
overwhelmed nurses who care for coveted
patients and
don't want to carry the virus back home
to their families
i've talked to business owners who've
closed and even more who are struggling
uh and employees who've lost their jobs
and those who are
anxious fearful that they might lose
theirs
and moms who are stressed over educating
their kids at the same time
they're trying to work from home i know
it it has been hard and it is hard
but we need to get the spread of this
virus under control and we can do that
and we'll get through this we just
do what the governor's asking us to do
we're going to get through this
to that vaccine that's the light there's
some great news
as the governor mentioned about some
quality vaccine options that are on the
way
we've got to get through this tough part
um
and you know i know it affects every
family and
every family needs to have a plan and
and i shared
with the governor this morning about
what our family our
family plan is on sunday my dad called
he and my mom are in their 80s and
i know the highlight of their year is
thanksgiving because it's the only time
of the year
where all of their kids and their
grandchildren are ever together
and i knew when i picked up the phone
answered my dad's call he was
he was he was concerned didn't know how
to do it safely so we talked about it
we made a family plan our families are
all
going to limit our exposure between now
and thanksgiving
we decided that we would have
thanksgiving outside this year
now i know that can be weather dependent
so we're going to be flexible maybe
it'll be the day before thanksgiving it
might be on thanksgiving might be the
day after thanksgiving
based on whether the weather will allow
us to well we'll cooperate and allow us
to do that
and we're gonna space everybody out have
every family
sit at their individual table uh in our
in our normal
family group but we're all gonna be
together just a little farther apart
than usual
uh and we know that this will
dramatically reduce the chance that my
mom and dad
will get the virus or be exposed to the
virus
and no it won't be a thanksgiving as
usual
but with the right attitude it will be a
great thanksgiving
and if we do it right if we all do it
right that will
make sure that my mom and dad get to be
around for the next thanksgiving
uh it will be inconvenient but we'll get
through it
we'll all get through this we just
everybody has to have that family plan
and sometimes we have to have those
difficult conversations like i've had to
have with my own family
about how we do this and i want to say
thank you thank you for all of you who
will make sacrifices
have been making them and will be making
them as families
over this holiday season and during the
next 21 days
but we're going to get through it we
just got to stick together
with that i'm going to introduce
somebody that i've been sticking
together with at least on the phone
for uh an hour a week for the
since april and that's uh john barker he
represents the ohio restaurant
association
we have been in regular conversations
with them about
how to keep those very difficult to
operate businesses during a pandemic
open and safe and
maybe maybe uh over thanksgiving just as
a thought you can order out from one of
his
his restaurant members that will help
you keep things
safe for you and your family as you're
you're trying to to celebrate
the season so let me introduce john
barker and he's going to
really i think reflect what the what the
conversations have been with the
business community about
how we find that balance between the
needs of
of our health care community and the
needs of businesses in the economy
so john let me turn it over to you
thanks lieutenant governor uh our
restaurants appreciate
the uh the plug you know for some uh
pick up thanksgiving dinners
that'll help everybody um and also thank
you
uh governor for all the time that both
you and lieutenant governor have given
to the business community and to the
into the ora you know i'm
really happy to be here today i
represent the ohio restaurant
association but
our board of directors were in support
of your announcement today about the 21
day curfew and um
you know we're all committed we're going
to do our part help control the spread
cover 19. you know we know there's
tremendous pressure
on the medical system and healthcare
workers it is severe
we know that and all ohioans now have
the chance to kind of step up a little
bit more
help curb the spread and lower the
number of patients
they're in our hospitals and the icu icu
units we know those are real numbers
and we know we're all very concerned
about that you know i have two daughters
in the healthcare field
myotis is a physician assistant here in
columbus
and the other is a registered nurse in
iowa they talk to me all the time about
what they see
firsthand and this virus getting it down
in ohio
and getting it down across the united
states is part of all of our jobs the
citizens so we appreciate
everybody being so focused on this and
we really appreciate your decision
as well as this announcement today we
think it's the right
step at the right time it's gonna allow
ohioans to do their part
without having what we thought would be
an immediate and disastrous impact
on restaurants and thousands of
employees that we shut everything down
the vast majority of restaurants and
hospitality locations
in ohio they are operating safely we
know that
they care so much about their employees
actually refer to them as
their family and we know that we also
love taking care of our guests so we
certainly want to be safe
you know months ago we started something
called the ohio restaurant promise
and that's where operators pledge to
meet and exceed
the dine safe ohio requirements you know
and we've seen
incredible examples all over the state
restaurants they're separating their
tables they're doing that six foot
distancing they're placing barriers
between tables and booths
they're doing more extensive cleaning
and sanitizing and it was already
something that was critical to our
industry
you know they make sure that their
employees are wearing their get in their
mask
and the guests are wearing masks until
they sit down to eat and i haven't saw
over the last couple weeks
installation of new air filtration
updated air filtration systems and units
and restaurants all over the place it's
just a great great thing that we're
seeing
we're really proud of the work that's
being done by restaurants food service
locations
and many bars you know even though many
of them are facing sales that have been
down between
20 and 70 versus the same time a year
ago
and any of you that are in business know
how difficult it is to operate that way
at the same time they have all these ppe
costs they're very significant
you know i think it's important to
recognize that restaurants have done
everything
to ensure that they're not spreading the
virus and the good news is that metal
experts medical experts confirm it's
true
the spread appears to be occurring in
unregulated
settings like we've talked about home
parties family gatherings social events
some schools and other places where
individuals
are not always following the advice and
wearing mask as our as our doctor talked
about
we believe the curfew is the best choice
to slow
things down right now and help everybody
understand it's time to be even more
cautious
i think it's a good decision most
restaurants
especially independent and family-owned
ones
can't survive the pandemic without all
of us doing our part to control
this virus you know many restaurants and
small businesses all over
ohio were able to take part of the
paycheck
protection program which was a lifeline
that was funding that we got a few
months ago
but that money's gone now more recently
governor you and lieutenant governor
provided several forms of financial
support including the bwc refund and
we're so thankful
for that those are all steps to help
businesses get through this
and employees however we all know it's
not enough
you know restaurants and food service
and retail businesses they need to
remain open
you know we're providing food to guests
at restaurants but you know that we're
really stepping up and doing more and
more carryout in pickup window
in delivery and this is going to help
ensure that as many of those 585
000 people who call our industry their
home that's where they work
keep their jobs you know we're really
also thankful for our ability to
continue offering
takeout and delivery past uh 10 o'clock
you know we feed ohioans and we take
care of thousands of essential employees
who work those second and third shifts
as well as everybody on the front line
who's working
24 hours a day you know we take this
responsibility seriously
and we pledge to continue operating
safely and continue to work with you
thank you
john thank you very very much appreciate
it
a number of your members have contacted
me about their what they're doing
with their air filtration and uh some
very very
uh you know really following the science
on that
and that's uh that's very important we
we appreciate that very much
thank you thanks for being with us
ready to go to questions governor your
first question today is from laura
hancock at cleveland.com
good afternoon governor uh
on monday the fbi searched the home of
the puco chairman
samuel dazzo an indication that he could
be
under a federal investigation you
appointed him
are you continue are you comfortable
with him continuing to serve in that
position
have you discussed the situation with
him i've not discussed it with him
um you know we have no indication he's
under investigation or he's a target of
an investigation
uh you know we'll we'll wait until we
find additional
facts but we don't we don't have any
indication of that at this point
next question is from tom jackson at the
sandusky register
tom
consider uh actually closing
restaurants and bars on thursday like
you had previously talked about
and also does are are people going to be
allowed to do
carryout after 10 or does everything
shut down attend well tom i missed the
first part i think i got the question
i'll try to answer it if i didn't answer
it you come back and tell me i didn't
answer it but
as as far as the carryout yes carryout
will
will be allowed nothing
no retail no place you can walk in
retail
uh but you could do it you could do a
drive-through if a restaurant had
drive-through
uh you could do if they have delivery
you could do the delivery
you can get a pizza delivered whatever
you want to have delivered
so and i sort of missed the first part
of the question i think
governor the first part of the question
is have you now
ruled out closing bars and restaurants
uh you
because previously there was an
announcement you were going to discuss
that thursday
yeah we looked at this and frankly we
heard from you know a lot of people who
work at bars and restaurants
and uh you know i've always said we do
we do listen
i got some amazingly compelling
uh emails in regard to this some texts
and you know behind each worker there's
a story
you know there's a single mom out there
who who's this is what she's doing
trying to keep her family moving forward
we got people with other
other situations so you know every
employee has a story
every owner has a story as a as well
so what we try to do is balance things
uh
but we have to take action and so we're
gonna try this we're gonna do this for
for three weeks uh we think that we
could accomplish frankly a lot more by
having this curfew than we could
at closing one or two different um
business sectors uh and so we're going
to try this for for
21 days uh this coupled with
uh the mask worrying enforcement in
retail which we're already starting to
see some results
uh it looks like people are more and
more people are wearing masks
uh that along with our request today for
everyone not only with the curfew
but to do one two three other things in
a day
to reduce the number of contacts that
you have
uh with somebody else and then we're in
the mass so if we could all do these
things
we will avoid uh shutdowns but
no one can predict the future uh i
do feel very strongly that we have it
within our power
uh to keep our kids in school uh
to keep those in nursing homes safe
and as well as keeping our hospitals
from being
over run and not being able to serve us
so we have it within our power to do
that we think we have a formula here to
do it to start knocking this
knocking the curve down again and we're
going to try it
next question is from farnoosh amiri at
the associated press
hi governor um thanks a lot for taking
the time today
i do want to go back and clarify because
i think
you mentioned something about people
still being allowed to go
get groceries after 10 p.m and i guess
i'm a little confused on how that would
work if all retail i don't know i think
gross look i don't think grocery stores
open
beyond 10 o'clock but if people are
going in there it's probably not a high
risk there's probably not that many
people in there so
we're not going to say you can't get
groceries and we're not going to say you
can't go to a pharmacy now
whether it's a pharmacy open beyond 10
o'clock there may be some but
we're not going to tell them that they
have to close someone may need
a drug someone may have some reason they
have to be
at a at a grocery store so you know
this is this is we want basically we
want everybody home by 10 o'clock
but there are there's always emergencies
and there's always there's always some
exceptions but all retail
closed by 10 o'clock you can do carryout
you can do delivery but all all of the
retail
basically that you walk into is in fact
closed that should accomplish
putting people at home um you know but
there are a couple exceptions that you
know
we think make sense
next question is from andy chow at ohio
public radio and television
andy hey governor uh so you just
detailed
how this order impacts businesses and
how restaurants can stay open for
delivery and pick up how does this order
impact just everyday people like you
said you want people you're hoping that
after 10 pm people go home
how will the health order be written is
it like a stay-at-home order for from 10
pm to 5am
well it's gonna be similar i mean we're
calling it a curfew we think curfew
probably
describes it at best uh i mean this was
reported
um you know i saw some headlines this
morning and
some stories yesterday that talked about
a business curfew it's really not a
business curfew it's curfew
uh the goal is to have fewer
contacts if we can take these contacts
with people have with other people down
20 30 percent
we saw the impact it had in the spring
we're not shutting businesses down
but remember in the spring we had a lot
of businesses open anyway some were
closed
we went to the essential non-essential
but the whole idea is if you can
slow these contacts down
that's going to be go a long way to slow
this virus down this virus lives
only when it goes from one person to the
other and so
if you reduce those number of contacts
that's why i
ask people in addition to the curfew do
something every day
think what am i going to do what would i
normally do i'm getting ready to do and
said no i don't want to do that because
that will uh you know increase the
contacts
and so if you just decrease the contacts
we're going to be better off the curfew
starts us down that path
i'm asking people to do more than the
curfew and we believe that those things
coming together along with
the mask worrying in retail we hope mask
worrying
throughout we'll start flattening this
curve and start getting this thing under
control
next question is from jeff redick at
wsyx in columbus
afternoon governor jeff does this uh
strengthen the 10 person gathering limit
in other words that's not often enforced
would it be more enforced
under the curfew mean science behind
this
yeah look i mean we don't anticipate for
example
uh someone's driving down down the the
road on
you know 71 or 70 or wherever uh you
know
and it's past 10 o'clock we're not
really anticipating they're going to get
pulled over unless they're doing
something else
but let's say there's somebody uh
there's there's a group of people coming
together
and it's 10 30 and they're in a park or
they're someplace there's someplace else
well
it would be logical for police to go
over there and say hey what's going on
um and so that does not depend on the 10
person order
is a curfew and the curfew is what you
know really would control
if you look at the 10 person order we
reissued it and the real
change substantive change in there is we
are very specific
in regard to banquets very specific in
regard to weddings funerals
these gatherings after the funeral after
the wedding
where people naturally want to get
together and that's fine
but they need to wear masks they need to
be careful they need to be
seated and so that was not in the
previous orders that
is now in in the orders next question is
from kevin landers at wbns in columbus
well governor thanks again for doing
this uh you are going to be criticized
for not being tough enough at a time
when cases
are going up if we shut down for 21 days
wouldn't that have a more
dramatic decrease or impact in
eliminating
these cases from going up what was your
driving
decision as to why you didn't feel
strong enough to do
a shutdown well a shutdown is is rather
dramatic we did it once
uh doing it the second time has you know
uh
double the ramifications quite candidly
uh some people survived uh the first
shutdown won't survive the second
shutdown even it's a relatively short
period of time
there are all the other consequences
lord chris talked about the consequences
that we have seen
in regard to mental health um you know
you do a shutdown
that you increase the mental health
problems
um you would be saying if you did a
complete shutdown nobody goes to school
uh and yet we know that um there
are kids who are doing well in school
that don't do well outside of school
and each school is making that
determination we would then be
overriding that
and telling every school they have to
close and they have to they have to go
remote all kinds of cons
all kinds of consequences um you know we
saw
uh when we looked at overdoses deaths uh
in the spring they went up
uh it goes back to something that lori
was was talking about director chris was
talking about
you know people being together and we
think one of the reasons those overdoses
went up is frankly
people took drugs they overdosed no one
was there two called
9-1-1 so for everything we do that
distorts the economy or or changes
things there are consequences and there
are many times there are unintended
consequences
so what i had to do is balance that you
know
the bad things that could happen with
what would be the positive things that
would happen
uh came up with this idea uh that a
curfew could carve into
that time uh cut the
contacts down but the success of this
also
not only depends on people following the
curfew
but also people were a mask
and seeing that mass compliance go up in
some
counties from 20 percent we need to get
to 90 95 percent
in stores we expect to see that and it's
also from everyone
pitching in and saying hey we can do
this so we've set a goal we got
21 21 days we need to knock this thing
down we need to start seeing cases go
down
um because even at the rate we are now
and we've not seen them go up for the
last two or three days
now it's over the weekend so you always
get kind of skewed numbers
but even at this high number if it never
goes up
anymore it's not acceptable these high
numbers that we are at
for 7 7 500 8 000 cases a day are going
to mean a lot more deaths and a lot more
people in icu and a lot more people in
the hospital
a lot more schools clothes a lot more
virus get into our nursing homes and our
hospitals be really hit so
i'm counting on the people of ohio we've
got 21 days let's do it let's start
today
let's do what we need to do and we'll
evaluate it after 21 days
no responsible governor would ever say
i'm not never going to do this i'm never
going to do that this is our attempt not
to do those things
it's our attempt to pull everybody
together on one team
not single out any particular industry
but say hey we're all in this together
we got to knock this thing down
let's let's sprint let's do it for 21
days let's see where we are and we'll
evaluate it after 21 days
governor um just wanted to
add a couple things to the question or
to answer the question
um just to try to simplify this for
folks
is that if 10 pm comes around you got to
go to work then you can go to work
if you got an emergency you can go take
care of it
but otherwise go home and try to help us
achieve the goal of reducing people
who are not normally in the same
household from coming together
when we had these long discussions over
the past week the hospital officials
said look that's the goal
everything that contributes to people
coming together is the cause
and everything that we can do to prevent
people from coming together is the
solution
and we tested this idea of the curfew
with
with the business community and the
hospital community
the health community and they all
thought this was a
was a reasonable compromise to get there
uh
to find that balance and if people
follow it it will work
uh it will definitely work to help slow
the number of contacts
and get us to the point where we're
going to be able to
get this in a manageable situation again
and as far as closing more down
i mean we always have to remember this
as a balance so the governor and i have
done
i don't know governor probably close to
calls with 30 counties and
superintendents and
hospitals and local government officials
and and
when you do these calls you get the
practical
feel for the interconnectedness of how
everything is in our society that when
schools are closed
nurses who work in hospitals don't have
anybody to take care of their children
how all of these things are connected
and how
keeping things open and doing it right
benefits everyone
from an economic and health point of
view but we just have to own it
we have to own doing this right so that
we can knock this
virus down get through this difficult
period
so that we can get to the vaccine and
and to kevin's question
we can do this this is this is a good
compromise between all of those
competing interests
next question is from jesse ballmert at
the cincinnati enquirer
hi governor jesse my question is
uh what evidence or experts do we
consult
to decide on the 10 to 5
number um and how that will make an
effect on the numbers and then the
second quick question is what penalties
are there for not complying with the
curfew
yeah we look we know we know the basic
science
and we had the doctors who we normally
consult
take a look at this and the basic
science is
fewer contacts fewer spread
less spread so anytime that you can
reduce
contacts you know statistically you will
reduce spread
particularly when you have in some
counties today
when you look at the number of cases
that they they have
and you look at it and you say it's one
out of 100 people in the last two weeks
have come down with the virus in this
county i mean that
tells you how dangerous it is out there
so whenever you can reduce that contact
it matters and that's you know this is
one way of doing it there's it's not the
only way of doing it we could have done
it other ways
but it seemed to me to make sense and
we ran it by a lot of different people
and scientists and who
thought yeah that that makes sense but
look nothing is perfect
nothing is guaranteed this is all
depends on how you know how well
we we do this so thank you
next question is from laura bischoff at
the dayton daily news
hey laura hey governor i wanted to
circle back to laura hancock's question
about sam randazzo you said there's no
indication that he's the target of an
investigation
why don't you consider an fbi pre-dawn
search warrant where they carry out box
loads of stuff
not an indication of an investigation i
mean you're a former prosecutor you
oversaw bci
tell us when these kinds of searches are
just friendly visits
look look the the fbi many times will
indicate that someone's a target they've
not indicated that he's a target
i have no reason to think he's a target
i don't know
um so you know were
waiting for additional information quite
candidly
um you know we uh i hired him
uh i think he's a good person uh
if there's evidence to the contrary then
we'll act accordingly
but i'm not going to act without that
without facts
next question is from jim province of
the toledo blade
hi governor thanks again for taking our
questions um
why did you settle on three weeks i mean
do you anticipate that uh
we would have to extend the curfew
beyond that do
would we have enough evidence as to
whether it's working after three weeks
and do you know whether this has been
tried in other states and what the
success rate has been
yeah i've seen that some states have
have looked at curfew i don't know
though
we've got an empirical data uh
you know what has happened when others
have used it it has been used in europe
uh the situation in europe is different
because in europe what they've been able
to do
when they put an earlier curfew you know
earlier
you could do a 60 o'clock or seven or
eight o'clock
when they've been able to do that
clearly they've knocked businesses out
and knocked a lot of employees out
and they subsidize those those
individuals we do not have the ability
in ohio
sadly to to to do that i mean we've
looked at it we've looked at all kinds
of options can we subsidize people
and you know the federal government came
through some very significant money but
that money is now gone
and we don't have the ability to look at
that as an option
so in answer to your question we know
it's been used in europe
uh it's been but it's used been used
differently than we would be using it
here
because we don't have any we don't have
any money and therefore we can't extend
those
extend those hours 21 days there's
nothing magical about 21 days
you know we instituted some things last
week that we thought will
make a difference we're instituting the
curfew now
uh we're asking ohioans do very very
specific things or refrain from doing
specific things
there's much more awareness today in
ohio about what
the problem is as people are seeing
these numbers go up as they're starting
now to hear from their local hospital
officials so
uh 21 days is an eternity
with this virus so where we are in 21
days i don't know i hope we're in a
better position than we are
uh today but it seemed like 21 days was
let's
give this a run for 21 days uh we may
have to take much more drastic action we
don't know
we may have to we may be able to get rid
of the curfew we may keep the curfew
you know we're going to have to judge
this um you know
at that time but this is long enough
until we can see you know get some
patterns that's long enough to see
what what is going on and what the
result there is of doing this
next question is from james pilcher at
wkrc
in cincinnati good afternoon governor i
wanted to circle back and
get specifics on enforcement
penalties who who enforces this
what are the penalties and uh as an
adjunct question
i saw a post today from an elected mayor
in this in the state
saying don't listen to the tyranny
have as big a thanksgiving as you want
what do you say to somebody like that i
know the two different
ones more of a logistical question yeah
well
look i just i think we're at the point
of this debate in this discussion after
eight months
that um you know the science is clear
as a former colleague of mine daniel
patrick moynihan once said
everyone's entitled to their own opinion
you're just not entitled to your own
facts and i would say that to that mayor
and to other people who are just totally
irresponsible
and want to be telling people to do
things that may end up
hurting them or killing them so i just i
find that to be
totally totally outrageous can you just
follow up on the uh
on the the penalties and the enforcement
is it going to be up to law enforcement
to enforce this and
and what can they arrest somebody can
they get what they're getting tickets
what are the what are the penalties here
yeah let me get uh i'm gonna have my my
team um
send in to me um the statute or the or
the reference point in here
and i'll get back i'll answer that in in
a minute but basically we're having
calls now uh our team is with with
with local law enforcement um and
again we do not expect law enforcement
to go pull people over because they're
out beyond
10 o'clock but if they're seeing some
something going on um this isn't
this is a way that law enforcement can
walk up to them and say hey guys
you know you're you're here you're
hanging out at this gas station or
you're here or there
you're congregating together and there
is a curfew and why don't you just go
home
uh you know we're not looking for a
heavy hand here and we don't want to put
law enforcement in a difficult position
on the other hand uh this is it is it is
a serious matter and we need to
we need to deal with it so i'll get back
i'll answer that as soon as i
get something from our team here thank
you
next question is from josh ruttenberg at
spectrum news
hi governor hi josh question for you
you've used words in this very press
conference like
dramatic to paint the picture of the
virus and common sense
as far as what certain measures need to
be taken
and the lieutenant governor said that
this was the least disruptive option in
the economy
um but do you have data to suggest that
the majority of people are out between
10 pm and 5 a.m as opposed to 5 a.m to
10 p.m
and if and if not why is this not being
done in reverse
you know josh uh excellent question uh
right now i can guarantee you there
there are
some people who are tweeting uh and who
are saying that uh
dewine is a dictator and a tyrant and uh
in doing this so you know we got
different points of view but we wanted
to see what could be
least disruptive that would not cause
other problems
other social problems unemployment
more mental health problems but could
make a significant difference and no of
course there's more people out during
the day than there is between 10 o'clock
and
and and 5 and 5 a.m but there are people
out at 10 o'clock
and the goal is you know we we put
a stop of alcohol some months ago at 10
o'clock
in in our bars okay
then then the uh you know people said
well they're congregating here they're
congregating there they're doing this
okay this should eliminate most of that
additional congregating and that contact
that occurs
after 10 o'clock and so while there may
not be as many people out after 10
o'clock
you know with the exception of those who
are working and doing other things you
know
many many of them are out congregating
together
and so this should get rid of most of
that
uh nothing's perfect and
this coupled with what we did last week
on with retail establishments
where we're saying you you know you
unless you've got
a medical reason and we resp and by the
way we respect those medical reasons and
somebody doesn't have a mass we should
not
no one should give them a hard time
let's just assume that they've got
a medical reason but you couple those
things that we've done
in the in the last um six days
and we think you know it gives us a shot
at this thing a good shot at it's
slowing this down now we know it's not
easy uh when you get spread as high as
seven
thousand new thousand cases a day seven
new cases a day seven thousand new case
a day
i mean you you know it's it's hard to
slow this down
the faster this train goes uh and it's
going pretty fast
now the harder it is to slow it down but
we think we have a shot at doing it
without causing many other social
problems
that also are very very bad so
i've said this before but most of what
i'm doing
and the choices i'm making are between
two bad decisions
which one's worse because one's least
worse
so lieutenant governor yes thank you
governor uh you
you hit the you hit the right point
right there is that
is that over the last week we have i
mean look we've been doing this for nine
months but over the last week
we really uh we really pursued
all of the available options and we
talked to medical officials and people
that were talking about the strain of
the economy and the mental health
issues and because it's not covid's not
the only problem of the pandemic
coven is the cause of the pandemic but
it creates other problems economic ones
mental health ones
and and this i i know
i'm convinced from the conversations
i've had over the last week
that this is a balanced approach this is
a middle ground
this will slow down enough the people
that are coming together
that we can impact the spread of the
virus
move it back to the point where it can
be controlled
and at the same time not cause
uh a catastrophic effect in the economy
and you have to care about both you
can't just care about one in isolation
you have to find a balance
uh that's what the governor tasked all
of us to do is to
to to help uh with that challenge and
and uh and based on all of the
recommendations this was
the most impactful uh with the least
disruption that we could
uh determine that we could come up with
next question is from scott hallas at
the xenia daily gazette
hey scott hey governor how are you i'm
wilson
good um a lot of school or not a lot but
there are many schools in the dayton
area who are starting to go back to
remote learning for the next couple
weeks or even
longer because of some outbreaks within
their
district um that leads to a few
questions i've received from some
from some folks regarding winter sports
um can we get any are we going are we
expecting any guidance from the state
or is the ohio high school athletic
association going to be the sole
decision maker as far as what happens as
far as attendance whether sports are
going to go on because they're starting
to kind of
you know kick in now with with things
starting up
yeah good good good question um
you know we the way it is set up now
uh it will be similar to fall sports
with no fans other than parents
but we're monitoring this you know we're
looking at spread
we're talking to school superintendents
as john said we talk to
them all the time um can't talk to all
of them but
there's a lot of them but we certainly
talk to a lot of them
i think most of them have my email uh
i'm getting
input from from them um but
so far you know we've not taken any
action to postpone
postpone the season so we're watching it
we're watching the spread we're
consulting uh with health directors
and we'll see but so far
winter sports would proceed uh with with
with a limit on
a number of spectators governor
um it's a timely question because i
have a call with the ohio high school
athletic association today at 4 30.
to get an update of of some interactions
that they've had
as an association to talk about the
health uh
situation as it is as the governor
mentioned
the the rules well i had a i had a call
with all of the
coaches athletic directors
superintendents last week to go through
all of the rules make sure everybody
understood
uh the inside versus outside aspects and
the things that need to
need to occur to make it safe they'll
they'll be germ
you know significantly less in
attendance because we're going to be
inside
versus what but it would have been
outside with a football game but there
are
fewer participants where a football team
you might have 50 60 players
with some of the the basketball and
others you you have maybe
12 15 players total so um
we are in constant communication with
the ohio high school athletic
association
it's not on them it's a collaboration
with us
where we're working together to make
sure that we can keep this as safe as
possible
let me just add donahue has
texted me non-compliance is a violation
of 3701.352
this is a general health order uh it's
like any
any other order i believe second degree
misdemeanor
um not more than 750 fine 90 days in
jail i would just point out that to my
knowledge we have
no one has been charged under under
these health orders doesn't mean there
couldn't be but
they have not been so far
next question is from lucia wallinches
at ai on ohio
good afternoon governor and thank you so
much for taking my call
um we'll be talking a lot about uh you
know making sure that people stay safe
and stay away from each other so that we
don't overwhelm hospitals
um last week the ohio court of claims
ruled that um the
number of beds available and you know
ppe and
ventilators and so forth should be
released to the public so i just wanted
to inquire
if you had any plans um you know when
and how to release that are you going to
add that to the dashboard is there a
certain time you're going to release
that every day
there's no reason we can't release that
uh that i'm aware of and i'm not sure
exactly how we're gonna release it but
we will
we'll should be able to get that out
great thank you
this is all data that you know we're
pulling we're getting
uh it's been reporting to us from from
the hospitals around the state
great thank you next question is from
randy ludlow at the columbus dispatch
hey randy
good afternoon governor we're still a
little unclear on the retail component
of this
you said retail businesses will
generally be required to close
what are the exemptions who can remain
open
and uh is dine-in permitted at
restaurants
past thursday no
randy we'll have this in the order
uh it's not out yet but you'll you'll
see it but
basically it is perfume
people should be home by 10 o'clock
there are exceptions
exceptions if you know there's some
emergency some reason they need to be
out and they're common they're basically
common sense
exceptions as far as retail
um you know we're never going to close a
pharmacy
not going to close grocery store because
they have things that some people need
it late at night
that someone in sick we're not going to
close those
as far as food no
dine in nothing open
but there could be delivery of pizza for
example
um there could be a drive-through
uh order and pick something up right
there
so you know those things would be would
be permitted
uh but any any retail you walk into
uh basically uh with the exception as i
said of the grocery store and the
pharmacy
uh would be closed at ten o'clock and so
it has the ability to really kind of
push people more towards home and uh
slow things down for for that period of
time
i'm sorry will dine in be still be
permitted at restaurants past thursday
no no dine in no dine in beyond 10
beyond 10 o'clock i'm asking about
during the day
you had talked to closing restaurants
apparently you're not going to do that
dinan will be permitted prior to 10 pm
yeah
sure and look we we we encourage
uh the restaurants have worked hard on
this
and you know there are a few outliers
uh but you know they come under
uh you know they need to have people
with masks and do everything they need
to do but the vast vast majority of
restaurants are doing what we have asked
them
to do and are working very very hard at
that
um you know look we we encouraged uh
carryout i think carryout is one way we
can support our restaurants
and it's a good thing
next question is from desiree gosselin
at wkbn
in youngstown hi yes thank you
um just to clarify on the last call
bar rule um is that still in effect or
do people need to be out of the door
before tonight
yeah every retail establishment will
close at 10 o'clock
next question is from jack windsor at
wmfd
in mansfield hey jack
hi governor uh last week your medical
experts told us that they see mass
compliance being high and that shutdowns
would do more harm than good
um and then back on july 15th cases were
already dropping when you said quote if
all of us
put on a face covering for four weeks
six weeks we would drive this epidemic
into the ground
now here we are 16 weeks later and in
light of that last week the new england
journal of medicine military study
indicated that cases were actually
higher
and those who quarantined and underwent
strict enforcement of masking distancing
and disinfecting
so it appears that the masking
distancing and quarantining
isn't stopping the spread but we do know
that it's certainly creating unintended
consequences that are hurting
many people but it also appears that
you're not willing to come off a dime
and consider different directions
so my question is why
well i'm going to refer to our doctors
dr still on
i am indeed yeah all right bruce you
want to answer that to jack
you know i would caution uh anyone
looking
at a particular study and using it as a
basis for
contradicting a vast repository of
medical
data and information it is
incontrovertible
that masking is effective in reducing
the transmission of this virus
it is incontrovertible that staying
apart from one another reduces the
spread of this and it defies common
sense
if one understands the very good science
around the droplet nature of this virus
and its droplet spread if one looks at
the pattern
of transmission across large populations
it is absolutely evident that this is a
respiratory virus
respiratory virus not unlike the flu and
that we need to do the
simple common sense things our mothers
taught us when we were young to avoid
getting cold
and flu we just have to do it in a much
more serious way with this one because
it is
more transmissible and there is recent
research showing that it has evolved to
be
highly contagious and i i think that's
that's the story thank you
next question is from adrian robbins at
wcmh
in columbus hi governor thank you so
much for
taking my question um dr vanderhoff said
that
we see hospitalizations as kind of a
lagging indicator
from what the hospitals are telling you
do we have 21 more days
if the curfew isn't as effective as we
need it to be
when it comes to how quickly our
hospitals are are filling up
well i'll let the doctor answer that one
as well i just i'll start
by saying look our goal is to set this
out
for 21 days if hospitals come to me at
any time
and say uh you know we have a bigger
we have an emergency you must take
additional action we're gonna
you know we're gonna listen i mean it's
all based on facts that are coming in
uh so you know we make these decisions
every day we've set this out we think
that
we can let this run for 21 days uh and
if
particularly uh if ohioans you know
really get the percentage of mass
worrying i'll go back to what jack said
i disagree with what jack said we have
some communities where mass warrants 20
in some establishments but it's going up
now and that's that's the good thing
bruce yeah i think it's a i think it's a
very good question
and what i i hope
um people are beginning to to gather
is just what you're pointing to that
this is a ship that won't turn around
quickly but
we should be able to see a real impact
from the guidance the steps that have
been
advised and taken over the last week or
so the masking the asking people to stay
apart and now this curfew in about two
weeks
so a two to three week interval to look
and see look for an impact is
just about the right amount of time it's
a reasonable window of time
to look for that impact and look
specifically for it
on our hospitals
next question is from ian cross at wews
in cleveland hi good afternoon thank you
governor
i have a two-part question um what
guarantees can you provide to assure the
small business community that compliance
enforcement will be applied
evenly and fairly regardless of if it is
a
fortune 500 company or a small
family-run business
and secondly do large retailers with
significantly more resources and
customers at any given time
have a great responsibility to go beyond
the health order that went into effect
on monday
yeah give me the give me the second
question again sure um
large retailers you know with with more
resources and more customers do you
think that they have
um a greater responsibility to go beyond
what the health order monday
um entailed
well the health order is pretty explicit
uh
you know i think many companies
certainly are already doing
some of this but i've had some
conversations with some of the bigger
ones directly so yeah i think they will
um but you know what we what we want to
see is substantial mass compliance in a
store
uh you know we want to see uh not
crowding
uh and that's the responsibility of of
these companies
to make sure that that that happens so i
think you think we're certainly going to
see
see that um as far as
fairness and compliance look i mean it's
always important to have fairness it's
always important
to be even-handed and the goal and we've
instructed
the inspectors and their background is
that their job
normal job is to making sure that
there's a safe work environment
same thing making sure there's a safe
work environment
we're not in a gotcha business uh we're
in the business of
you know if there's a problem telling
the owner there's a problem telling the
manager there's a problem hey
this is how you fix it this is what you
need to do so we intend to work with
people but
but people have a right when they go
into a
retail establishment to feel that most
the people in there are going to have a
mask on
and if you work there you have the right
to think that people come in the door
gonna have a mask on too
governor next question is the last
question for today and it belongs to
kenny bass of wchs in charleston west
virginia
governor thanks for stopping by our
region this week it was good to hear
from you
in our area um i i don't want to go too
far down any conspiratorial
rabbit holes here but there are many and
you've
even referred to people today who could
dismiss you as a
tyrant imposing your will but
i would say that there are many moderate
fair-minded people in the country
who have legitimate concerns about
government power
and the ability it has to influence our
lives and so how do you
help ease their any concerns they might
have about
what limits that you see your power as
governor
should be imposed upon and and how we're
not sliding down this hole
to where more and more things are denied
or taken away
whether it's good-natured or not i mean
there is a constitutional right to
freedom of assembly
curfews i know have been proven to be
held up in court under emergency
circumstances
but there are many who have a lot of
concern and worry
about this country even in the midst of
a pandemic
fundamentally changing in some way well
kenny i think that's a very good point
and i think it's something it's a it's a
caution
that all of us should hear who are in
government uh all of us who are making
decisions
um you know throughout this uh
we've been very clear that uh we're not
gonna violate the first amendment
and some people have criticized me for
doing that some people have said well
you needed to shut churches down i said
i'm not going to shut churches down
some people said you need to shut
demonstrations down i'm not going to do
that
some people have said political rallies
you need to tell them
you know i beg people to do things at
rallies and beg people to do
but but you know so there's there's a
there's a limit
and i think we have to have respect for
our constitution
we have to have respect certainly for
the first amendment
and i believe that we have shown that
throughout this
um so we're going to continue to do that
but it's a it's a good
it certainly is a good is a good caution
so we're going to wrap up today our
son-in-law bill darling sent a video
uh i think you'll enjoy it our columbus
area musician dave powers
a professor of music at osu did this
video
