afternoon everybody
the mask i was wearing
is from one of my favorite places a
national museum of the great lakes in
toledo
if you've not been there it is a fun
place fun for kids
fun fun for adults great great place
i'm wearing today a tie of eastern
gateway community college
they're in steubenville and also in
youngstown on a very
very sad note i want to offer my deepest
sympathy and condolences to the officers
of the cleveland police department as
well as friends
and family of detective james
skirnavitz who was killed in the line of
duty
last week the detective was working
undercover
sitting in an unmarked police car with a
confidential informant when someone
fired on the vehicle
tragically both the detective and the
informant
were killed today two teenagers were
charged in connection with these
senseless murders reports say that
robbery may have been
the motive but we don't know
the detective spent more than excuse me
more than two
decades in law enforcement protecting
the citizens
of ohio he was sworn in the day before
his death to work
as part of a federal initiative to fight
violence
in cleveland long long distinguished
career of service protecting
his fellow ohioans
leaves behind his wife kristen
children matthew bailey and peyton
and to them and to all the officers
family and friends
we send our deepest deepest sympathy
well now that labor day is marked the
official
end of summer schools are
starting back in many of them have been
in for for several weeks
uh ohio state is back and has been back
um it's really my pleasure today to
introduce you
to the president of ohio state dr
christina johnson
who i've been talking to quite often i
think
she officially became the president of
ohio state on september 1 but i know
that she has been very involved
for the few weeks leading leading up to
that dr johnson thank you very much for
for joining us thank you very much
governor and thank you for
everything you and your team are doing
to keep us
safe and healthy well we just wanted to
give get a report
uh about what's going on at ohio state i
know dr johnson you've been
uh ohio state's been very engaged in
testing
uh students and uh maybe if you can kind
of give us an overview of uh
you know when school started back up and
how many students are on campus how many
are
living in the columbus community and
kind of what you've been doing in regard
to testing
thank you very much governor so as you
said we
started up our first full week of
classes started
the week of august 24th we have about 12
000
students living on campus we have about
20
000 students that are coming back to get
some kind of face to face or in
classroom instruction
so that's about 8 000 off campus they
come to campus
and about 12 000 that are on campus so
um prior to me coming to the ohio state
university you know certainly an
outstanding team under leadership of dr
gail marsh
set up a strategy for returning to
campus
and once i came in i started working
with the team and we decided to
enhance our testing so we really are
focusing on three groups right now
we're focusing on those you know 11 and
a half to 12 000 students that live on
campus
mostly first year students and some
second year students few international
students
and then 8 000 students that are off
campus that come to campus
so that's sort of our group too and
group three would be the 2500
faculty staff and graduate teaching
instructors that we have so we're
starting to test them fully
so today just by the numbers i am an
engineer so i like to geek out on the
numbers a little bit
um we've tested about forty thousand uh
we've done about forty thousand tests i
should say so we're doing this on a
weekly basis
we're ramping up to do about twenty
thousand tests a week this is our third
week
so the forty thousand we have about
fifteen hundred students that have
tested positive
and uh twenty five employees
so fifteen hundred out of about forty
thousand
is a positivity rate of around three
point seven percent
now this isn't just a flat rate you know
it's gone up
the on-campus uh positivity rate
peaked in and around august um
you know like 28-29 we have a dashboard
that's up
at about 5.87 percent
so the fact that it has dropped and it
kind of you know bounced around just
like we've seen with the state of ohio
but is a reason for cautious optimism
that are non-pharmaceutical
interventions
really are working so wearing masks
staying socially distant
washing hands and our students i
couldn't be prouder of them they've been
very vigilant off campus we had a pretty
high number
when we started testing them at scale
last week i think
that it was uh add or over 11 percent
and now that's dropped in the recent
dashboard it is
at about 5.45 for the last 24
hours so we're seeing that again
when i walk around campus and i walk
around columbus you know i see our
students
uh more on campus we need our off-campus
uh
students faculty and staff and
individuals in columbus to be ever so
vigilant wearing masks but
wearing the masks staying socially
distant it really works
so um that's sort of the status with
regard to testing sir
so doctors i recall i think you you may
have told me that
when students came back you started of
course the testing
uh and you know that's kind of snapshot
the first couple days back
um the numbers were i think pretty low
that's good right somewhere around a
half of one percent
i think you told me something like that
and then
is is that right or am i well i think
you're close i think i don't remember
exactly but i think it was a it was
certainly less than two percent
maybe it was one and a half percent i
think that was the number but
but low as you said uh then it goes up
right and that and now it's and now it's
coming down and i think that
you know what is going on at ohio state
is instructive because you are doing
a very very significant amount of
testing so
you you really have a a very good feel
for what is
is going on and i think you know that
that might be helpful to
you know other uh places uh particularly
colleges universities who might not have
the capability to do the extensive
testing that that you were
you or you were doing um so it sounds
like they weren't bringing it
in at a very high rate students get
together
do what students do do what we all do
and this gets up
but but obviously your your messaging
sounds like it
is is having some impact now and the
kind of
maybe maybe peer pressure but i wonder
if you could maybe
talk a little bit about that why do you
think it's starting to come down or is
coming down
right well i think there's a couple
things in thank you governor i think
one of the things we recognize is we
really had to amp up our
our contact tracing so as soon as we get
back a result that uh
student faculty or staff is positive we
start contact tracing immediately
so then we were able to isolate and
quarantine those individuals that needed
to be
isolated quarantined or treated so i
think that was one thing the second
thing is that our student life
organization led by dr melissa shivers
has just been outstanding
and she's really engaged the whole
community
on together as buckeyes so it's taking
the pledge
recognizing that yes we can do
alternative programming
and uh still in enjoy but at a distance
the college experience and i think that
it was as you said
students coming together for the first
time and not recognizing that it's
pretty easy to
transmit this virus but it's also pretty
easy if you do just a couple things wear
a mask and stay socially distant
to stop it transmitting and so i think
that was
another uh thing i think a third thing
is that we have a
college of public health led by dr amy
fairchild and they started modeling
and started modeling certain behaviors
and and then modeling how those
behaviors translate into
positive cases and then what our
capacity would need to be in order to
trace and then isolate and quarantine
and so i think coming together
the wexner medical center has been
superb they do about 500 tests a day for
us
for symptomatic so the way we've parsed
it is we have the student health
student health system services and the
webster medical center
be available for symptomatic individuals
and then we do the asymptomatic tracing
through a third party provider because
the last thing we want to do is
take up any of the capacity from the
state of ohio for
ohioans that need access to the testing
so that's been our strategy and i think
that
that together as buckeyes we've engaged
great athletic director of gene smith
he's gotten the athletes that done these
um social media campaigns about
what's your why you know why are you
going to wear a mask and why are you
going as
socially distant for me i came back to
the academy because i love the students
i want to see the students
out there on the oval i want to see the
faculty the staff i want to attend all
the
the performances and the lectures and
the richness that
just drives a university and that's my
why and
each of us has a y and if we just dig
down and pull up that y
i think it's pretty straightforward why
we want to do the things that will keep
us safe
doctor that you expressed that very very
well we each have a reason
we each have a a goal and i assume for
many students it's
it's simply to be on campus to be part
of ohio state or be hard
part of whatever college that uh that
they're they're going to
um you mentioned a kind of a difference
in numbers between
off campus and on campus and i'm going
to make a statement you don't have to
agree with it but
i just assume that it's easier uh
for a college
to control what's going on directly on
campus classrooms for example
you can do the social distancing you can
do those things
when people are off campus they might be
you have
thousands of students who are in
non-ohio state housing
i so so i assume that that maybe gets a
little more difficult
you want to comment on that well it uh
yes no thank you governor i think that
as you know and you were great to be on
the call earlier today with our inter
university uh president's council of all
the 14 public institutions in the
country and i think we're seeing all the
same thing
is that on campus when we the classroom
is one of the safest places to be
you know we disinfect the classrooms
couple times a day we reconfigured 450
classrooms so that we can be synchronous
and asynchronous in our instruction
we reduce the size of our classes from
100
down to 50 because the models would say
that in that situation
you can actually um have a pretty pretty
high probability of avoiding someone who
is
infectious that would be in the
classroom so we find the classrooms are
safe
our our dorms we have great residential
advisors
and they're being very creative about
how do we engage students in programming
when you have to stay six feet apart
and i can just say one thing about that
you know i was talking to on my first
day
um i tried to go out and meet as many
students as possible and it's tough when
you have to stay six feet apart
but i was on a zoom call with some of
the student leaders and one student said
alice she goes
you know what the first year as first
year students
we want to be part of that 2024 picture
you know where all the students get out
in the field
the famous ohio you know from the band
and we miss that this year
and within two days we set up to allow
any student who wanted to come down the
ramp onto the field
see their picture on the big screen and
get a photo of being on
the the field and the horseshoe that
opportunity and we had
hundreds if not thousands of students
sign up in pairs socially distant
and it's that kind of innovation i'm so
proud of from our students and
it's really is inspiring so i think
that's right i think we have
uh more of an ability to control things
on campus and
off campus um i spoke with the
panhellenic leadership this weekend
melissa um shivers and gene smith our
ads spoke with the
interpreter in the council and just to
talk about in
in high density aggregate housing
whether it's fraternities or not
you know this is really you know it's
very serious stuff and it's very easy to
spread so
getting out that message and
communicating and
um you know we're all young ones
fortunately
and i i think when i was that age i
thought i was invincible and i
i learned pretty quickly i wasn't so you
know i think that that's something that
we want to help our students move
through and
appreciate how important it is to wear a
mask and stay apart
even when you're out dr johnson thank
you very much good luck to you and
the students and faculty and everybody
at the ohio state university
and uh i think you're off to uh to a
good start and
keep going thank you sir appreciate it
thank you
i want to talk for a moment about gun
violence i want to go from tuesday
september 1 through labor day
looking at that week period we found
reports from across the state of
40 people who were shot more than half
of the victims
21 tragically died
i'm going to keep saying it we have to
in ohio get tougher
on repeat violent offenders we have to
get tougher on those who are convicted
felons who have absolutely no business
having a gun we need to do this
we have pending in the state legislature
a bill
that would do that and i urge my friends
in the general assembly to take that
bill up
uh here are a few headlines from the
just the past week we did this last week
we did it the week before
this is just the past week um that
certainly are more than just
headlines behind each headline is is a
tragedy
and are individuals from the columbus
dispatch
double homicide and apartment complex
caps deadly day this double homicide
happened last tuesday night
two others were killed earlier that day
leaving four people dead due to gun
violence in franklin county
in less than 24 hours let's go to a very
good
second headline this is uh abc 13
in toledo 15 year old
shot wednesday night dies from injuries
the teenager died after being shot
multiple times
a 10 year old was also shot and injured
a 10 year old
a news report indic indicate that
juveniles may have been involved in this
crime kids
obviously can't legally carry a gun and
somebody has to have given them the gun
um our bill in front of the general
assembly also cracks down
on those who give knowingly gives
someone a gun when they know that person
is not legally
entitled to having that gun let's go to
our third headline wlwt in cincinnati
man dies one day after being found shot
inside his
his car this happened in cincinnati's
second district on friday around
7 00 p.m uh just
very very very tragic and very very sad
let me let me move on
let's look at some of the data
[Music]
again we all we know that the data is
skewed a little bit from sometimes a lot
from the weekend
now particularly if you have a three-day
weekend so our numbers are down the case
is
down tragically 22 deaths that have been
reported and let me let me just say
we get sometimes questions about these
deaths and questioning the numbers
these are the number of deaths in that
are actually we
have found out about that we know about
that have been reported
into a 24-hour period period of time
and the other one hospitalizations and
icu admissions
uh eric let's go to the next one
so we continue to rank all 88 counties
uh these are the 88 counties one through
88 again this is a snapshot looking at
two weeks and two weeks only the past
two weeks
looking at how many cases per hundred
thousand population trying to
even all this out and we rank them by
the highest
number per 100 000 population new cases
and the highest number of and all the
way down to 88.
so let's let's go to the top ten
you'll see some movement here montgomery
and franklin both of those are being
certainly being driven
to some extent by what's going on at
ohio state and the university of
dayton but by and large the counties
generally are staying pretty much the
more rural
counties starting with putnam
at a very very high level for the last
two weeks
and butler meigs mercer montgomery
shelby ugley's dark
franklin and henry county
let me turn to some good news for
families who may be struggling
thanks to a federal program thank
thousands of ohio children who qualify
for free or reduced
price meals but are currently learning
remotely
will soon receive additional money to
purchase nutritious foods through the
pandemic electronic benefit transfer
or p-e-b-t made possible
by the united states congress earlier
this spring
this was a federal program through the
trump administration through congress
earlier this spring ohio was able to
issue more than
uh 250 million in pebt benefits to more
than
850 000 students through the program
jobs
family services were issued a second
round of benefits
later this month to eligible children
parents do not need to apply to receive
these benefits if you already have an
ohio
direction card the benefits will be
automatically loaded
onto your card if you do not have an
ohio direction
card a pre-loaded card will be mailed
directly to you
to issue these benefits we're adding or
excuse me we're asking ohio school
districts to submit information for
eligible students
to their local information technology
center as soon as possible
school districts receive an email with
information on eligibility and how to
submit data from the ohio department of
education
they got that from high department
education this friday so we'd ask them
to fill that out our goal is to ensure
that every
single eligible child gets to benefit
from this program
speaking of children we know that many
of you are making decisions about
activities for your children
this school year and really making
decisions about what your family is
going to do
or or not to now the cleveland clinic in
conjunction with clorox
put together a fantastic resource called
safer at home it's available at
clevelandclinic.org coven19
a-t-h-o-m-e what i think is particularly
valuable
is a matrix that they have come up with
help families weigh the risk
of contracting cova 19.
so joining us today is the associate
chief
safety and quality officer of the
cleveland clinic dr aaron
hamilton to kind of explain that dr
hamilton thank you very much for joining
us
thank you governor and good afternoon i
wanted to express some gratitude just to
start for you and your team's leadership
uh for all ohioans to the pandemic
so um i i'm really thrilled to be able
to come here and talk a little bit
about a framework for people to think
families to think about um as they make
decisions
as you mentioned about what they're
going to be doing returning to different
activities
as we return to you know a community
that's looking more and more normal the
natural question is you know what is
safe what is not safe how do i make sure
that
i'm safe my family's safe my community's
safe
i think one of the things that i see is
that
all the questions that come up things
can get complex very quickly
and what people lack is just a simple
framework
to kind of make assessments about what's
the level of risk
and then people are then empowered to
make decisions on their own and i think
about that framework
very very simply in terms of time
space and people and the time part is
really about
time how much time are you going to
spend an activity
you know is it a little amount of time
is it a long activity
and in that same time dimension i think
about
how frequently you're going to be doing
an activity so it's both the duration of
time and then the frequency
so time then space is this an indoor
activity
is it an outdoor activity is there the
ability
to socially distance how can you spread
out
or not needs to be taken into
consideration
and then lastly people and we don't
think about this a lot
but i urge families and and and folks to
consider how well do you know the people
that you're going to be interacting with
and how well do you know that they're
adhering to
the safe guidelines that we've put out
there and i think actually president
johnson did an amazing job of outlining
what some of those simple things that
have been really effective for us in
ohio
and across the country across the globe
and it begins
and ends really with hand hygiene and
washing our hands
it's about face coverings or masks and
it's about providing
appropriate physical distancing and
thinking about that six feet all the
markings we see on the floors
when we go out into the community in our
schools
and otherwise so that's really the
framework that we're asking
people to use and you can think about
what is the safest thing
is me or one of us or a family member
seeking health care whether it's well
care or emergency care
our health care institutions in the
state of ohio are open
and they are safe so that is on the
spectrum
extremely safe on the other end of the
spectrum you could think about
a wedding that's indoor and has a lot of
folks
all gathered together difficult
social distancing maybe borderline
compliance with masks and shared food
that's a high risk environment and
that's thinking about that time
space and people matrix so we're really
urging people to
think about that to inform decisions
that make it appropriate
for them personally as they move forward
so doctor that's time space in people
let's let's take a couple of you want to
give us a couple more examples
and tell us what the analysis would be
yeah
um you i'll let you pick them
okay sure well i think one of the things
that comes to mind it's certainly top of
mind for those with
children whether it's going to
kindergarten or third grade or sixth
grade or 12th grade
college is our back to school this year
is not a back to normal right and so
we have to think that it will look and
feel different
and there will be a focus to ensure
safety so this is a space
from a time perspective you're going to
be going
spending multiple hours if it's in
person so
that element you're going to be spending
time there and you're going to be going
frequently
space often in indoor activity
but schools are working to create space
limiting class sizes and creating the
opportunity to get appropriate physical
distancing
and then people we know our teachers are
doing everything that they can to remain
safe
and following all the core uh guidelines
to stay safe
and then our friends and our colleagues
our co
students hopefully are doing the same so
in the end
going back to school i'm i'm hopeful
that
um we can with our collective efforts
uh get our children and our our students
back to school in a meaningful
uh way hopefully in person over time
so that's just one example we're
thinking about that another example
people often think about is going to a
restaurant
you know many people through the
pandemic haven't been going out to eat
or have thought twice about that and i
think what i ask people to do there is
to understand
those decisions around time space and
people
is call ahead find out what the
restaurant's doing
think about carryout think about if
there's outdoor dining
and think about if you know if employees
in that restaurant are
required to wear masks or not and that
helps you make a decision
for you personally i think the last
thing is
thinking about how we get together with
our friends and family
and these can be difficult conversations
and i think it's important
i'll focus here on the people part is
sometimes
you know it's important to understand
what our families
and what our friends are doing if
they're wearing masks
if they're appropriately socially
distancing and we have to use that and
incorporate that and decide
maybe it's better to do a zoom visit or
a facetime call
with family this week as opposed to
getting together in person
so we have to think about that and all
the decisions we make to get together
let's say i decide i'm get up some
morning or
later in the afternoon and i said i want
to go walk on a bike path
yeah what are the variables there how
safe is that
that's great so me and my family we love
to use the metro parks we go hiking
almost every weekend
um there time usually not a huge time
commitment
space it's outside it's generally spaced
apart we might see a couple people
and we don't typically know who those
people are so what we do
is when we're around folks on the path
we'll wear a mask
and we work to create social distance
there
but otherwise if we're walking or we're
biking
we or we're running we don't need to
wear a mask and we feel like that's a
very safe activity
particularly in our own neighborhood but
generally we always bring it with us we
we never leave home without our mask
now you mentioned uh let's let's let's
say a wedding
and let's let's look at the time the
time factor um
uh maybe maybe i'm not saying one of
these is
more or less safe but let's let's take
a wedding that's an outdoor wedding and
uh
people are people are spread out um and
let's say it's a 20-minute wedding
compare that with maybe uh let's say
uh a similar wedding but now we now we
tack on to it an
indoor uh indoor reception you wanna
kind of walk us through some of that
yeah absolutely so that that wedding uh
that you described on the front end of
your remarks
uh sounds like a very friendly wedding
in this environment to go to a very safe
wedding
outside short you generally know the
folks
you're able to space space out and
create distance great
the reception indoor that is a decision
that we
you know i actually asked people to make
for themselves so you say
what kind of space is there are people
wearing masks indoors
or not and you have to make a judgment
call
about what's comfortable for you but
clearly that's getting
a little bit higher risk than
actually ceremony part that you
described so in the rubric
that i was describing i think it's
slightly riskier
but you know i think one of the things i
think about and we all should think
about
is approaching the pandemic with
compassion and empathy
and understanding that you know we have
to continue
to kind of live and make choices that we
feel good about
um and are mindful of our fellow
citizens and i think
these are individual decisions and what
we want to provide is that framework
that makes people
be able to kind of measure what the
amount of risk that people are going to
take on is and i think that's the best
way
to take on this pandemic and to continue
to kind of keep our numbers down
dr hamilton thank you very much for
joining us if anyone wants to
read more about this where can they
where can they
read more about what you're doing and
maybe what you've been writing about
yes absolutely so on the
clevelandclinic.org website
you described we have a safer at home
guide it is open access and free to
anybody we also have return to work
documents and so those are very
extensive too if you have more detailed
questions
you can see where we can talk about the
best way to stay safe at home
and to stay safe at work dr hamilton
thank you
we appreciate it thank you absolutely
very much
and now to honor our great ohio history
the ohio history connection is once
again hosting
what they call the ohio open doors event
this time virtually to recognize our
state's historic places
this event which begins friday invites
ohioans to virtually visit historic
landmarks and
properties ohioans can go to
ohiohistory.org
open doors to learn more about this
event it's a great opportunity to learn
more about ohio's heritage and encourage
everyone and i certainly encourage
everyone to go check that out again this
is something that happens
every year in person this year it can't
be in person but you can
from the comfort of your home go check
out a lot of
a lot of ohio history
now before i turn it over to lieutenant
governor
i want to talk about um a rumor i don't
spend much time talking about rumors
that are on the internet because uh we
wouldn't get much done
uh if if we did that all the time but
this one i've gotten so many calls and
over the weekend uh that i thought we
would just
have to uh deal with it today this is
comes in the category of
crazy ridiculous internet rumors but
uh obviously some people are reading it
so i want to clarify it uh clarify it
um i want to clear up any confusion
about the latest non-congregate
sheltering order that is
getting all of this attention to
understand it we have to go back to
march 13th
when president trump declared a national
emergency for coronavirus
following that on march 20th the state
of ohio and
fema uh trump administration fema
entered into an agreement
authorizing ohio to apply for emergency
protecting measures including
non-congregate sheltering in other words
federal government would help us pay for
that if that was needed
on march 31st president trump approved a
major disaster declaration
for ohio on that day the ohio department
of health
issued an order to comply with the
federal government what they asked us to
do
that approved non-congregate sheltering
for people
who were unable to safely
self-quarantine in their place
of residence the order provided that
sheltering
in non-congregate shelters in other
words shelters where there weren't a
bunch of people but
single places should be determined by
the local health
officials and based on individuals needs
this applies to people who may not be
able to isolate their homes or those who
are living in shelters for example
now make it very clear this order does
not create
fema camps to force anyone to quarantine
against their will as
been reported on the internet the order
was first issued march
31st it was renewed on april 29th
same order and again on august 31st
this order creates a funding mechanism
to allow for federal reimbursement
for those looking to create places for
people to safely
isolate or quarantine
has been used in a few cases in ohio and
actually has not been used
very often but in each one of these
cases
we were taking this authorization from
the federal government agreement with
the federal government
and being able to provide space
for individuals to use when they need
it for example first responders
let's say there's a a health
professional
and they are working and they do not
want to go home let's assume
maybe at their home is someone who is
has a
health compromise they're working in a
coveted
area of the hospital helping covet
patients
and they say look i don't want to go do
that this provides them
a place a hotel maybe uh to go hotel
room so they can go and the federal
government will
will pay for that so that is that is the
type
uh situation that this was created for
uh again um
it just create the order our order
really creates just a funding mechanism
to allow this to happen
uh i am aware there there are rumors on
the internet
uh that incorrectly claimed these orders
allow children to be separated from
their parents
without permission let me just say this
is absolutely
ridiculous uh it is not true there is
no intention that anyone has to separate
children
but somehow this has been reported on on
the internet
no truth to the rumors uh at all
families will not be separated children
will not be taken away from their loved
ones
and so having quarantined housing
options gives people the choice when
they need it of a safe crumpled place to
recover from the virus
or as in the case of our
uh health folks it gives them a place to
shelter gives them a place
to be so that they don't have to go home
and possibly take that to their family
again that's their own
their own individual choice so the
bottom line neither president trump's
fema
nor the ohio department of health are
going to set up fema cap
camps for anyone to quarantine against
their will
what we are doing is making available
safe place for people to stay when they
have loved ones
that they're trying to protect and they
have no no other place
to go last thursday i was asked for an
update on ohio's prisons and i'll try to
do this very quickly
director is not available today but i'll
give a quick summary and then
we'll bring the director in in a
subsequent news conference
we are now at around 44
600. this is the lowest prison
population we've had since 2005.
right now there are 247 inmates who are
positive for cobit 19
at 11 of ohio's 28 prison facilities
17 prison facilities are covered free
among the inmate population at this time
but most facilities do have some test
pending
so let me turn it over now to lieutenant
governor john
thanks governor uh just a quick couple
quick things today
first of all an award uh that we receive
that i want to use the occasion to
create some awareness
many of you know and the governor and i
last year
announced the get in line online project
for
bmv facilities deputy register
facilities across
the state this was done as one of the
innovate ohio bmv
collaborations and it's basically an
effort to get used technology to improve
the way
we provide customer service in the state
uh
simply you go go like this you go to a
bmv website you get online
you select your location uh you reserve
your spot
they'll send you a text with that
confirmation you and you you
enter that information in uh when you
get to the bmv location into their kiosk
and then you claim your spot in line uh
something that we want to do
anyway to make it convenient for people
but during covid
something that's really important
because we don't want we don't want
lines and we don't want
people congregating uh so the technology
arrived
at the right time we are happy to
announce today
that the ohio bmv was awarded a cus
customer convenience award from the
american
association of motor vehicle
administrators for the get in line
online queuing system so it received a
national award
uh for improving the way that we're
serving our customers
and uh this system uh
is is great anytime but during covid
even more important because we not just
with this
but with anything we don't want you to
have to stand in line
or uh have to congregate waste any time
that's unnecessary
and and you know hopefully you know that
almost all bmv services can be
obtained online this is just another
tool to help with that
and go to bmv.ohio.gov to find out more
information
if you're on your way anytime soon to
your local bmv
i also want to offer
some thanks today i read a story about
some states
that are trying to build partnerships
with the private sector to
solve some of their problems fortunately
we have had several companies
that stepped up to help with this and
and uh the company i want to thank today
is root
root insurance today i want to recognize
them for their help with our ohio
pandemic unemployment system
and they really helped us in a time of
need if you recall
the federal government offered this
benefit to 1099 workers who did not have
who had previously not been eligible for
unemployment there was no system for
this
the folks the federal government passed
the plan they provided the funding but
we had no delivery mechanism and within
a couple of weeks
we worked with ohioans to get them
pre-registered
to help them enter in their username
password
read some frequently asked questions to
get them in the queue
so that they could be ready to receive
this assistance well
root helped us build all of this they
volunteered to create the system
they had a team of about 10 people that
from from route that worked to build
this in five days and they
pre-registered over two hundred thousand
ohioans
uh to get them registered uh because our
twenty-year-old unemployment system just
couldn't handle it
uh the folks from route build an entry
into that in five days
and that they were fantastic they helped
us at a time of need
the job department of job and family
services
is grateful many citizens out there who
are using these services are grateful to
root
and i just want to highlight that they
and many other people are stepping up
during
this difficult time to pitch in and make
things better for all of us and
and so i thank you a big thank you goes
out to root insurance
for that help also while we're on
businesses
businesses are helping us remember out
there help your local business there are
a lot of small businesses
restaurants and others who are
struggling during this time
please make sure if you're interested in
buying a service or
you have something that you may
be in need of check your local check
your local businesses
and see if they can provide that before
you maybe look online and go somewhere
else so
local businesses are are supporting us
and we encourage you to support them
and then finally governor on a on a
solemn note
i want to just take a moment to honor
the life and
and share i know which is yours and my
condolences for
pat patrick sweeney uh the the great uh
ohio legislator served in both the ohio
house and senate from the cleveland area
was a fixture on capitol square at
getting things done
not only for all highlands but for
northeast ohio and
and we want to honor his life and
service so
thank you john thank you for mentioning
pat sweeney um
if my grandfather was alive or my dad
today they would say that
they looked at pat sweeney that say this
man has the
map of ireland on his face uh written
all over his face
uh pat sweeney was a remarkable
individual
um you know i think he was everyone's
friend everyone considered him a close
friend i considered him a close friend
but i know there are probably
hundreds or thousands who thought they
were a close friend of pat
and considered him him a dear dear
friend pat sweeney had the ability
to look at big problems in the state
come up with big solutions but he never
forgot
the individuals he never forgot the
people who
were most in need of whatever that
particular program was or whatever that
particular policy was so we had the
ability to combine it
really on the ground level with with
individuals but to see them
the big the big big picture and so we
were just very saddened to see
pat leave us pat sweeney was
a true statesman and her condolence goes
out to his
his dear family ready for questions
governor your first question today is
from joe ingles at ohio public radio and
television
hello governor how are you today i'm
well joe thank you
i want to ask you um we've got these
students who are
in college right now and um as
president johnson was talking about they
are
testing positive that rate she said is
going down and it may go down
but if it continues to
be at a significant level is it
safe to keep those students in college
for the entire semester then send them
home
around thanksgiving where they are
likely to be exposed
to even more vulnerable vulnerable
populations
uh like grandparents and such who might
be around for the holidays
well joe that's an excellent question uh
you know a week ago today we had
discussion with the vice president
uh trump administration doctors and one
of things they said is you know what you
don't want to do is send students away
to college
a couple weeks there and there's
breakouts uh of the virus and then they
leave
and go back home so you know that is
not something that we're looking looking
to have happen i've had discussions i
talked to all 14
uh college presidents this morning with
our state university four-year system
um and they all certainly understand
that
uh you raise the next question though or
or a question that we're gonna have to
face in the future and that is
what about thanksgiving and i think
that's going to take some
real thought
there are some schools that basically
made a decision we're going to close at
thanksgiving and not come back until
january
again though it raises the question of
whenever they leave college and if
if the rate is high there
what are the precautions before they go
back home and you know for colleges that
have the ability to test
and we may have a lot more ability uh
you know by mid to late
november uh than we do today uh but
making sure that we know whether
positive or not before they leave would
certainly be the ideal situation
uh so so we could protect the vulnerable
people who live
in their homes back wherever home home
is so
a very very perceptive question uh it's
a work in progress
but uh i think your sentiment is
absolutely correct
next question is from scott hallis of
the xenia daily gazette
hey governor thank you how you doing hey
good
good good hey so we're we're two weeks
into the football high school football
season
and you know a few weeks into that and
other sports
um what have you heard back from the
folks who are doing the compliance
checking
uh as far as the requirements for
football i
you know i've seen things on social
media but you know you can't trust
everything on social media obviously but
what
what kind of assessment have you heard
back so far
well scott i don't have any statistics
um
you know i was on a conference call 7 15
this morning with
we do this every every monday morning
with all the health directors around the
state
to my knowledge there was nothing
mentioned about football or any other
sport we talked about a lot of different
things a lot of different problems
so that is not you know i'm not saying
there has not been
some problems there may be some
quarantine because one person on that
team or more than one
you know tested positive or had had
symptoms but at least as expressed to
me by health directors you know the much
much bigger concern
is what young people do not on the
not on the playing field or their
practice field uh
but what they or nor in the classroom
but rather what they're doing
other times and we still see
both with students both with college
student and with college students
and with those not in college
uh that the the huge spreader is just
informal parties informal get-togethers
where people are laying their guard down
or they're not wearing a mask
or they're not keeping keeping the
distance so this is occurring
at all ages um we're seeing a lot of it
of course at
the college level but those are would at
least appear from what i'm seeing
to be a much bigger problem uh than
the athletes uh practicing or playing
themselves
but you know as you said it's only two
weeks in we're going to have to
obviously continue to
to watch this i think the schools and
the athletic directors
uh are and and the coaches are working
very closely with their local health
department
and again if anyone's not out there we
just encourage you to do it because
this is really the key uh for us to move
forward not just with
with sports uh but it's the key to us
moving forward and keeping keeping kids
in school governor
thank you governor john john
on the on the high school the ohio high
school athletic association
has been sending out observers to look
at what's happening
and to help the schools make sure that
they're in compliance
i don't have a report on what happened
in week two of football season
but in the first week they found almost
complete compliance or a couple
minor challenges here and there but they
they literally coached him up they they
helped the the local schools understand
what they needed to do
um but but there was you know widespread
compliance and things look pretty good
and then the initial reports and we'll
have con continued information because
we know
usually it goes that way when we start
out we do a pretty good job with it
and then maybe we let it slide a little
bit and we just need to make sure that
that doesn't happen because so far so
good
yeah i think people working very hard at
the event
uh the event itself uh it's just
the other it's the other things in life
uh sometimes get in the way not just
with athletes but with with everyone but
i think by and large the schools are
doing a very good job uh i think
the athletic side of the schools are
doing a good job as well
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
hey governor hope you had a good holiday
weekend thanks max
thank you so
going off of some stuff this weekend and
also uh the rumor that you were talking
about briefly
um as a covid19 vaccine becomes
available
would you get one and secondly um with
the rumor you're talking about
how important it is is it to dispel some
of these conspiracy theories and things
floating out there like that
well yes i would get a vaccine um
and i think let me just make a comment
about the vaccine i watched some of the
news over the weekend national news and
watched some of the
news this morning look the more we can
do
to take down the politics in regard to
the vaccine look i think we should
look to our scientists and our doctors
let them do what they do let them work
to develop this
and work to develop it in a safe way
so i think that you know that is very
very important and look
the people of this country are going to
file the news
they're going to see you know when this
comes out and this starts to be
available and we don't
know when that will be i mean we've been
notified to be ready by november 1.
but that doesn't mean this is going to
start in november 1.
uh we don't we just don't know we just
don't know when it's going to happen
but i i think people will make their own
judgment on that
and um you know they're going to decide
whether they think it is
it is safe or not but i i think the
officials who are
looking at this um you know are going to
make good decisions and i think
certainly the
um the scientists who are working on it
we all
you know we're all on their side we want
them to get this we want to do a good
job and we want them to get it right
but we want to get as soon as possible
too
and anything on the rumor that you
mentioned
oh rumors in general i mean there's a
new
internet rumor all the time and i you
know i can sort of tell by uh the emails
that i get
i look i we'll try to knock down some of
these rumors when we hear them
we can't i can't spend an hour an hour
and a half
uh every time just talking about every
rumor that's up
up on up on the internet i mean what we
have tried to do
since march when this started was to
give people the best information
uh that we that we could um
and we started with not at as much
information as we have to do today i
assume in another month we'll have more
information we try to share that with
with everyone and try to let people look
at this
from all kinds of different angles
um you know the one to 88 that we put up
there
that's not to shame any county uh it's
not to embarrass anybody
it's just to say look for the last two
weeks at least
this is the number of cases that your
county had
and it just sort of tells you some
something about the spread that is going
on in the county so
our goal is to arm people with as much
information as we can so they can make
the rational decisions that that
they would want to be able to make
next question is from ben schwartz at
wcpo in cincinnati
hi ben hi governor um i want to ask
today a question sent in by a wcpo
viewer
um this viewer is concerned about his
parents in their 90s
he'd um he'd like to take his parents to
get flu shots
but doesn't feel it would be safe for
them to go into a drug store or doctor's
office
i'm wondering if ohio has any kind of
plan to help administer things
such as flu shots to people who are
unable or
unwilling to travel to places where they
feel they might catch covet 19.
yeah ben let me check to see what what
kind of programs we have i'll report
back
next time i i think that um
you know my experience and i understand
the hesitancy of
the people have to go out uh if they're
in their 90s but
um you know as i've talked to physicians
um and talk to people in the medical
community you know they've emphasized
how important it is
to get this flu shot and i i asked a
doctor the other day i said well when
should
you get that the answer was now you
should go ahead and get it now
um you know so i i think that
for anyone getting that flu shot is is
in fact you know very
very important and i know that
doctor's offices have really done and
and clinics hospitals have been very
very careful
um when they have someone come in you
know you'll see them in
in in with masks i went into a
medical facility the other day and
everyone who was there who was working
there had a mask on and a shield on
uh they had they had both both of those
so
they are very very careful and so i
would
you know urge people if you have the
ability to get out or have somebody that
can take you out
you know go ahead and not delay go ahead
and actually get those shots
get that shot next question
is from jackie borchardt at the
cincinnati enquirer
good afternoon governor um you released
the
oregon health department released the
order on school reporting
late last week and some of the schools
we've talked to we're surprised that the
only
public reporting requirement for them
is to report to local school districts
that it's optional that they
post numbers and information on their
website or a publicly
facing facebook page why make it
optional
for schools to report their numbers to
the public
uh jackie i'll go back and look at that
our intent was that you know
the schools you know first of all their
first obligation is to the students
and the parents of the students and they
should you know inform them
what we said is they have an obligation
to
which they most of them do anyway they
inform anybody who's in that classroom
if there was a child in that classroom
who comes back and is is positive
then take it the next step also is you
know any
parent of a child in the building where
there is coveted
certainly certainly should know that as
well
we also set up a mechanism where you
know this data will in fact
get reported now we did have some
schools that did express a concern
you know about reporting numbers uh and
particularly in
in a s in a small actually by
building or a small settings so their
pushback was in regard to
um you know that that type of
information
uh might be so specific that it would
disclose
someone's the fact that someone was
coveted which obviously you cannot
you cannot do under undo under the law
but i'll i'll look at the procedure
uh i'll get i'll get back to you on
thursday
next question is from alex ebert at
bloomberg
good afternoon governor thanks for
having us um
have we seen the covet spikes in
colleges across the state
translate into higher rates of
hospitalization at community hospitals
in those areas
or the positive cases currently being
mostly contained to campus
thank you yeah i don't i don't think
we've seen that transfer
into a higher
number of people going into the hospital
in fact i think that's not been true
uh you know one of the concerns is a
kind of
a a kind of a ping-pong ball of fact
uh you know let's say someone who gets
infected who's
18 um as we express
as i expressed a few minutes ago the
concern is they go back home and they
infect someone else
i know there's also a concern with some
of the health departments that some of
our universities some of our schools
with high you know they're showing a
number of young people coming down
students coming down with this they're
concerned
about that possible spread out into the
community
but to my knowledge they've really we've
not seen
much of that yet nor have we seen
you know hospitalization and what we do
know is
while antonio can get pretty sick
they usually do not usually do not end
up in in the hospital
next question is from jack windsor at
wmfd
in mansfield hey jack hi governor
uh this question comes from one of our
viewers who is a parent
and it says quote the cdc said kids are
not getting seriously sick from
coronavirus
not passing it to teachers the white
house medical advisor said the same
and went on to say kids should not be
wearing masks or distancing
these are experts yet we are putting a
lot on our kids to handle
tough emotions educational handicaps and
then making them feel responsible for
the health of their teachers
and other adults the state site says
cases and hospitalizations peaked about
10 days
before the state mass mandate as a
parent i worry about
the health risks of those masks
bacterial and viral infections
but also the emotional consequences the
question governor is
why are we putting the health of adults
on our kids instead of letting the
parents and grandparents
take ultimate responsibility and will
our kids ever be without masks in
schools
thank you well let's talk a little bit
about that
um you know
the science on mask i think is
overwhelming
um we've had a number of experts who
have who have talked at our press
conferences but you don't have to
look at our press conferences you can
look at you know any
number of places uh where experts have
said
you know the importance of mass mass or
are
very very very important um
when we got ready to put our uh
final order on in regard to schools i
had on the phone i told the story before
but we had on the phone
people from children's hospitals all
over the state of ohio
and what was their recommendation the
recommendation was a very
firm every child k through 12 should
have a mask on
you know that is what the experts have
said you know
is there some outlier out there well
maybe there is but
um you know the jury's back uh there's
there's a verdict and the verdict is
that mass work and the mass
should should be used um we do know
um that some kids can get very sick
um but we know that the fatality rate
among
20 and younger is certainly very very
very low
but that's not the fear the fear is a a
they get
sick and
maybe have some long-term damage i i
told you what the numbers that were
given to me at ohio state several
weeks ago in regard to their athletes
that 13
of the athletes who tested positive had
some
some heart problem uh that was not it
was mild
they said in every case it was mild
about 13
and so that's why the recommendation was
when somebody gets off
is recovering from cova and you think
they've recovered they need to be
checked out by a doctor before doing
uh strenuous exercise again we're
listening to what the
what the medical doctors are are telling
us to do
finally we know that children spread um
and the real concern for the community
is
young person gets it they take it back
home there's a grandparent there there's
someone in the home who has
a sibling someone who has a medical
problem
uh and then that person gets it and then
you know we have all the consequences of
of that so we're going to continue to
look at the medical science and listen
to the medical
community listen to our doctors and try
to make our judgments based upon that
next question is from laura hancock at
cleveland.com
hi governor dewine um
hello hi we've had a few recent
tragedies in the state including one in
shaker heights
um a couple weeks ago um which appears
that a father was struggling with mental
health issues and he took his life and
the lives of his family
as we head into shorter and colder days
this fall
and people are becoming more isolated
are you concerned about whether the
state has enough resources to help
people with mental health issues during
the pandemic
and what can we do as individual ohioans
to help those
struggling to prevent these kinds of
tragedies
yeah i think what we can do as
individuals is try to think every day
about you know
who we know friend of ours acquaintance
of ours
that might be feeling isolated because
they're in a nursing home
because they're at home by themselves
and just don't have anybody
so i think that's something that
everybody and i'll i will try to do that
i try to do that every day i don't do it
every day but
uh i'll try to do that today and if
everyone watching this could do that and
pick up the phone call somebody
uh whether you're related to them or not
and just kind of reach out to them
that's a small thing but it's something
that if enough
enough of us do that that does in fact
uh uh
make make a difference um you know
second
i i i would say that i you know
i'm not the expert on isolation i'm not
the expert
certainly on mental health issues but
you know one of the things when i look
at this
mass question jack asked about the mask
but when i look at that
i look at that as a way to be out more
to have more freedom to be able to go
more places
to feel that i'm being protected when i
when i do that and so i don't have to
hunker down at home
all the time now look if you're if
you're older
that's the one question we got about the
two nine-year-olds and they feel safer
in their home we're not gonna
you know tell them not to feel safe but
if people are staying home
they're concerned uh but they would like
to get out you know
if they do it carefully and wear a mask
they can do that and we would certainly
encourage them to
you know to get out and and and and to
do that
i also know just finally uh that
uh director laura chris who's we've had
on here
before heads up our mental health and
addiction
services department you know
she's constantly pushing out more things
to work with our local community mental
health folks
to reach out and to help people who are
having mental health problems but you're
absolutely right
this is a big big byproduct of this
pandemic uh the the mental health uh
problems uh and we're we're seeing it
manifested
in the story you told by in the hor that
horrible horrible tragedy but also in
other
of the stories we read and other things
that we hear about
next question is from jim otte at whio
in dayton
again governor good afternoon um some
members of your own political party the
republican party in ohio are now pushing
some of these as you say rumors
not just as a story but as a matter of
fact that's where a lot of people
learned about the so-called fema
concentration camps
that are coming and they don't say this
is something that might happen they are
saying this
is fact i just read one on a state
representative's facebook page
pushing this story what would you tell
that person and how do you
uh especially these people who are
saying that you've gone way overboard
and handling this from the very
beginning
how would you deal with these people
because their constituents trust them
they voted for them
and they listened to what these people
say what would you say
well look i mean there's a hundred and
jim thank you for the question there's
132 members of the general assembly
have various uh you know ideas and you
know we work with them and have a
with the vast vast majority of them have
a very good working relationship
and good friendly relationship
look i mean i just i think that there
are rumors out there
and we all like the internet we all use
the internet
we all kind of like the modern world
that we live in but we
we all have to i think um admit uh that
there are some downsides to
to the internet and you know there is no
uh editing there is no
people can publish anything they they
want to and
in this particular case they took two
set of facts
uh they had nothing really to do with
each other they put those two together
and came up with a conspiracy theory
and uh you know we we're not going to
have any uh
fema camps uh we're not going to compel
children to do anything we're not going
to separate children from their family
members
uh you know that's certainly the last
thing that i ever would want to do
so it's just it's just kind of sad to me
that there are people out there
who take a rumor like that put a few
facts together that are unrelated to
each other come up with some conspiracy
theory
and then put it out there and i can tell
people are
listening to it because of the emails i
get or the calls that
that i get so i just decided today to
try to knock at least knock this one
down
and just say look this is there's just
absolutely no truth in this
there's no substance behind it it's just
garbage
next question is from kevin landers at
wbns in columbus
hello governor hey kevin uh governor you
mentioned last week there were some
inconsistencies
with the saliva test results at nursing
homes what's been determined to be the
problem has it been fixed and when do
you think we can expect results and in
that same vein
also the pcr test that you mentioned may
be too sensitive in some cases telling
people
they are positive but not contagious has
that been worked out have you worked
with the hospitals
to try to tweak that so you're getting
the correct results
well i think the pcr tests are are
correct
it's not that they're not correct it's
just kevin as we get further
into this and try to drill down on
you know i'm always interested in
actionable information
you know in what we're trying to do
every day get things done you want
pieces of information that will enable
you to go take an action which in fact
you know in this case lessens the odds
of someone who will get the coronavirus
so the pcr tests are accurate it's just
sometimes
they continue to show a positive even
when that person is not contagious
they may still have that virus there and
it's it's picking it up
but they may not be in fact contagious
so as we move forward
trying to to use the different tests
um in conjunction with each other to
figure out when that person is
is in fact contagious so you can isolate
that person for that period of time but
not
not longer that's really what the goal
is in in regard to
uh the first part of your your question
it would appear
and i'm waiting for a final uh kind of
conclusion from my team
but it would appear that we may have had
a lab problem there
um and so we're still still analyzing
that but that was
what my team told me is the initial uh
conclusion
and uh you know we we have pulled back
uh from that
until we can find out where that either
gets fixed or
or or does not get fixed so we're we're
still
still looking looking at that and i'll
report more
as we know more next question is from
tom bosco
at wsyx in columbus
hey tom
we'll come back to tom next question is
from marty schleyden at the ohio capitol
journal
afternoon governor
can you give us a quick update on the um
federal
uh unemployment supplement the three
hundred dollars
a week that's supposedly coming our way
uh
fortune's got a story up saying that it
it's gonna run out really quickly so can
you
give us an update on when people can
expect to see this money and how long
it'll last
yeah i've not checked back in the last
few days initially
we were told that this would be we would
be able to get it out
in the latter part of september
so in the next in the next few weeks i
don't know whether if the lieutenant
governor has any update on that
or uh sometimes john can uh
text someone and get an answer before we
go off the air so i don't know if you
have anything else on
john or not yeah governor uh we're
still set for mid to late september
roll out of that to to people and i
believe
ohio was approved for
over 700 million dollars and so when
that money runs out
will run out i'll confirm that number
though before the end of the news
conference
we have the exact number on how much
we've been uh approved for
thanks marty we'll go back to tom bosco
at wsyx in columbus
hey tom
hi governor can you hear me now i'm so
sorry hey i can hear you now yep
yep sorry this is my first uh my first
zoom call with you since you've been
doing these from
cedarville um dr johnson's not still
with us because this is probably a
better question for her but i
want to know if you've had any
conversations with her about big ten
football
i know how she voted when it was time
for that and now senate leader matt
huffman and other lawmakers in other
states
have come out with a new letter to the
big ten urging them to
are you hearing anything about the
possibility of a chance of a season
beginning in october
and did the big ten make the right call
in their vote
well i don't know whether they made the
right call or not
but i think there certainly is a a
decent chance of there being a season
in football for the big ten for ohio
state which is what we're really
concerned about i talked to gene smith
this morning about that
issue i'm not going to disclose our
conversation
other than i inquired about it he told
me it was still in play
still very much a possibility but as you
know
it's not a secret that dr johnson's
position ohio state's position was to
play
and you know i'm i concur in that
um look the key is always going to be
how it is done uh and
you know as i told some people
i don't know i've said it publicly or
not but
athletes at ohio state with their
capability of testing you know
very very very frequently
you know could potentially be the safest
people
there uh with a couple things coming
together one
very very close in time testing uh and
two a real
uh strong ethic to stay safe
to be able to play football it's sort of
the same thing we're hoping for and
counting on
for other students not just at ohio
state but across the state
that their desire to be there to be in
campus to to be able to participate
in school will be a driving force that
will
hold them back from doing the party at
10 o'clock some night when someone
invites you over and it sounds like it's
a great
it's a great idea so um we hope that
that
that push to have uh have a
a year on campus uh a year at ohio state
or a year at miami or ud or wittenberg
or wherever
uh will be a motivating factor for for
all the
all the students and for the athletes
you know we hope that
that plus uh the ability to to play a
sport that they
they love very very much so so we'll see
i don't know what's going to happen in
regard to the buckeyes but
i know it's still still very much in
play
governor just wanted to give a quick
update on the the
unemployment assistance we have we've
been approved
for 717 million dollars and
that will be paid out until the money's
gone and then at that point in time we
would need
to see an action from congress
appropriating additional money to
continue that program
thanks john governor next question is
the last question today and it belongs
to dan
perlman of wcmh in columbus
hi governor uh franklin county is
back in the top 10 for case occurrence
you said some of that was due to the
number of cases at ohio state
how concerned are you that those
positive cases may lead to a spread
within the greater columbus or franklin
county community
well look it's it's a concern and you
know dr johnson
divided out the positivity among
students who are on campus versus off
campus off campus was higher
we know that the in columbus
university is a part of the community
and so you have potential spread
so it is it is a concern but the good
news is
you know ohio state is not just sitting
sitting there doing nothing ohio state
is
extremely aggressive and they have the
capability of doing the testing
and so not only are they messaging uh
and trying to get students
to understand this is you know this is
what will prevent them from having a
year at ohio state
if things really go south uh but also
they're doing very very significant
testing and they're doing significant
tracing
so and they're working very closely with
with the health department
uh the columbus health department so uh
while
it's it's always a concern uh if you
have a college
uh any place and there's
students who are testing positive sure
that's a concern in the community but
um you know i've talked to a lot of
college presidents
and i think they all understand that
they understand their responsibility
they understand what what they have to
do and they're
they're focused on so let me
let me just conclude i want to thank
everybody i will
look forward to seeing you all on on
thursday
i want to end uh with joe mullins and
the radio
ramblers and a tribute to the great
state of ohio and let's just dedicate
this to
all ohioans uh who have done i think a
phenomenal job who have
kept this virus down who've continued to
fight it every day
and this is just a tribute to you and
thank you and tribute to our
absolutely wonderful state of ohio
