so
good afternoon everyone
tuesday we talked about
what we think will be our endgame when
we have the vaccine and then enough of
us
have taken it so we get the community
immunity um and the best guess is that's
sometime next summer no one knows
exactly but that's the best
guess of the experts and that day will
come
but today i want to talk uh and examine
exactly where we are
uh as of today in regard to this virus
what the essential facts are
then i would like to briefly talk about
what i believe that we have learned in
the last
seven and a half months
so today october 15th these are the
essential facts
yesterday we reported 2039
cases our record
today we are reporting 2178
cases another record this is in
stark contrast to not too long ago
september 20th barely a month ago we had
762
cases and for some time we were
hovering around a thousand
cases so we've gone up dramatically
in a relatively short period of time
number two in addition to the increased
cases we're seeing more people get
sick enough to be hospitalized
hospitalization of course is is a
lagging indicator
and as more we see more cases we assume
we're going to see more hospitalizations
but already
we're seeing a significant change
on september 20th we had 563
coveted patients in ohio hospitals
yesterday we had 1042
patients covet patients in ohio
hospitals
so it's basically doubled in a short
period of time
number three
today we add 13 new
red counties giving us a total of 29
red counties that represents 65 percent
of the population of the state of ohio
65 percent of us basically two-thirds of
us are now living in red
counties number four in addition to our
29 red counties we also now have
52 counties that are high incidence
counties as of today
and again we'll define what that means
this means the county has more than
100 cases per hundred thousand residents
during the past
two weeks this number is the distinction
that the cdc makes between a county with
a moderately high level
of spread and a high level of spread
so 52 counties high level of spread
we certainly know that a high level
cases in the community means a higher
risk of catching the disease for
for everyone number five
um let's let's before we get to that
let's go
directly eric to the numbers and we'll
start with the days
the summary again as we said
2178 cases our 21 day average is
still there but it certainly is moving
up as these numbers continue to go up
uh reported deaths today five
hospitalizations 108 a little bit over
the 21 day average
icu admissions have jumped rather
dramatically with 43.
let's look at the next slide eric
this is our advisory last week
this is what this date looks like
this week let's go to the next slider
so this is what we're looking at uh
today
and again
the h simply means high incidence so
we're seeing a good part of the state in
red
we're seeing very little the state now
seven counties that are in yellow
let's take a look at the next slide here
uh and this is just putting the high
incidence counties together with the red
counties those are the ones that have
color to them
and again it shows that most of us you
know
live in a high insulin county or and or
a red
a red county let's take a look at the
next linear
this is shows the change uh
and we've taken each week going back to
july 2nd
and shown how many counties were in the
yellow
what percentage were in in the orange
what percentage in
red and so if you flip over to here
you see yellow is very very small
i've got we've got some some of the
orange
and then red is is the biggest uh
much that we have seen it uh it was
fairly high
back on looks like july
16th uh it was fairly high there
there as well let's take a look at the
next slider
uh this is all 88 counties ranked by the
highest
uh occurrence again
we're seeing a number of counties well
over half the counties
that are high high incidence so if you
take down
you go down the first 52 counties or
above that hundred
hundred or above and if you look down
below that you'll see if you look at the
next ten counties they're
they're creeping up on those numbers too
let's go to the next one eric
this is again from the top to to the
bottom
um not all 88 counties we've got i think
20 counties here
and you can see these are all you know
at least two sometimes three
times as much of the high incidence
i want to talk briefly about why the
high incident number
is important in conjunction with our
high
with our public health alert system uh
the two figures the alert system the
color code
color maps as well as the list of high
incidence counties really
work together it's like looking at the
weather report for the day you can't
make your decisions by looking at only
the temperature or the chance of rain
everything
all kind of works together when looking
at the spread of
covet one of the most important factors
is how many cases there are in
a population and you look at that for
the last two weeks so it's not
historical not something happened
through
three months ago it's what's happened in
the last two weeks
so we can think of this like the
temperature for the day uh it's
your most important number for knowing
what you need to wear if you're going
outside so it tells you
you know how much spread you have in
your county
uh again liking it to weather the
temperature tells you a lot about the
weather in a day but it doesn't tell you
if it'll be windy rainy snowy humid in
the future
so we should think of the advisory
system that map system
as the rest of these factors all put
together and some of them frankly are
early warning
signs the advisory system
your county's particular color combines
several other measures like the number
of people going
to the doctors for covert or the number
of patients in your hospitals
with coven cases per capita are
incredibly important for understanding
how much spread and
potential spread there is in the
community an advisory system is another
layer of information
it's like looking at the temperature
then also getting an alert for strong
winds in the area
but here's the difference the difference
is we can't generally change the weather
we can't change the weather but we can
change the outcome
and so these are reflection of what we
see today but also a reflection of early
warning signs
but we can change the ultimate outcome
uh down the road by what we do what we
do today
let me also talk about a couple other
numbers
our positivity number today is 5.4
and our seven-day moving average is 4.2
during the third week in september our
positivity number was 2.7
uh this simply means that the percentage
of our test coming back
positive has more than doubled
uh this is very important uh as we see
tests go up we would expect to see some
more cases
but what we really then have to look at
is positivity and what we should be
seeing is a decrease in positivity as
the testing goes
dramatically up instead of that we're
seeing
not a decrease in positivity we're
seeing a very very significant
increase so in summary at this point we
have 70 counties 70 of already
counties that are either red or high
incidents that's 10 million ohioans or
85 percent of the population
live in an area with a high risk of
community
transmission
i want to review uh because we've not
done this for some time and because so
many ohioans are now living in a red
county i want to review
go through and look at the indicators
indicator one is called new
cases per capita the indicator is
flagged if there are greater than 50
cases per 100 000 residents over the
last two weeks
this allows for counties with different
population sizes to be appropriately
compared
this is what we've been saying is our
temperature and the weather report is
very important but it's not the whole
picture
indicator 2 is sustained increase in new
cases
this is an indicator this is an early
warning sign
this is flagged if there is an
increasing trend
at for at least five consecutive
straight days in overall cases by onset
date over the last three weeks this
reflects disease spread
in the population indicator three is
proportion of cases not in congregate
setting again what this is trying to
simply determine
uh is if more than half your cases are
not a congregate setting that tells us
there is spread
clearly out in the community indicator 4
is sustained increase in emergency
department
ed visits for covet-like illness this is
flagged if there's an increasing trend
of at least five consecutive days
in either the number of visits to the
emergency department with covalent
illness or
a diagnosis over the last and this is
all over the last three weeks it
provides information on the health care
seeking behavior of the population and a
sense of how concerned residents are
about their current health status and
the virus
indicator five sustained increase in
outpatient visits for covet-like illness
this is flagged
where there is an increasing trend of at
least five consecutive days in the
number of people going to a
health care provider with cova symptoms
who then
receive a coveted confirmed diagnosis or
a suspected diagnosis
and again over the last three weeks so
this indicator requires some kind of
diagnosis from a doctor rather than just
a patient reporting covet-like symptoms
in addition to providing information on
how concerned residents are about code
it also gives us an
early indicator of health care use for
covert
indicator 6 a sustained increase in new
covert hospital admissions
this is flagged when there is an
increasing trend at least
five consecutive days in the number of
new hospitalizations due to covert
and this again is over the last three
weeks this informs us of the burden on
the hospital system
and disease severity and as a sign the
storm clouds are gathering
uh in fact that it's it's coming um
we could be in for a very very heavy
heavy storm
uh as you recall uh this
indicator uh has to do with
uh europe uh
because people end up many times in
regional
hospitals that is that is indicated
indicator six intensive care unit bed
occupancy
is flagged if both the percentage of the
occupied icu beds in each region goes
above
80 for at least three days in the last
week and more than 20 percent of icu
beds are being used for covet
19 positive patients for at least
three days in the last week
there are four of these indicators that
are typically present
for our red county so far this is what
our
weather forecast looks like two
indicators are present
in all of these 29 counties indicator 1
which is new cases per capita an
indicator 3
proportion of cases not in congregate
setting
indicator 2 sustained increase in new
cases is flagged in 22 of our 29
counties an indicator 5 sustained
increase in outpatient visits is present
in 23 of the 29 counties
both of these mean we're seeing the
weather start to turn in these counties
it's again an early early indicator
um
indicator 4 sustained increase in
emergency visits is flagged by 10 red
counties an indicator
6 sustained increase in hospital
admissions is flagged
by just three of the red counties
again unlike the weather we have the
ability to to control this but this is
where we are
are today
we have as i said 13 new red counties
today new red counties
i want to talk a little bit about what
we are seeing in the data and what we're
hearing from the health commissioners in
regard to those counties
almost to a person our local health
department officials have told us we
this week that our schools are doing a
very good job
but what they are seeing is spread
sometimes connected with the schools
in social gatherings but not officially
connected
with the students could be social
gatherings among
students from parents or others
examples include bonfires birthday
parties
weddings funerals we know that several
red counties still have several formal
events planned like
pub crawls political events art fairs
car shows
now is really the time to rethink
whether these are in the best interest
of the community
our health commissioners tell us they're
seeing less and less mass compliance
when people are out and that people are
not wearing masks when they're with
friends and family
um as one health commissioner said
people are complacent in places where
they're
comfortable that's human nature and
we've talked about this before but what
we're seeing many times is people who
are with friends
with family letting their guard down not
wearing a mask not keeping
the social distance if you're in a red
county
if you're in a county with high
incidents
the virus is spreading throughout your
county quickly and everyone is at risk
really of catching it
let's look at some examples in cuyahoga
county
they have seen a significant increase in
daily outpatient visits
in just 10 10 days outpatient visits
they were averaging 187
cases per day outpatient visits uh
now 100 now 445 so from 187
to 445 within a period of 10 days
down in lawrence county southern tip of
ohio high school was closed for two
weeks after a non-school associated
non-school host excuse me non-school
associated homecoming event
led to at least seven children getting
sick and
25 percent of the school being
quarantined
the cases are now expanding
unfortunately to other family members
fayette county school and a daycare were
closed after staff
went to work sick our friends in fayette
county have had two members of their
community die
tragically during the past eight days
mahoney county an elderly woman died
after attending a relative's
wedding there were ten cases associated
with the wedding
muskingum county they're still seeing
one or two new cases each week from
their outbreak
at their social clubs and this started
around september 18th
and so these are just examples of some
of the stories that
we're seeing some of the things that
were
what we'll continue to learn um
the message you know is the same stay
home when you're sick
keep your distance wear a mask
wash your hands uh let's turn to
a couple of health care care providers
and experts
and ask them about what they're seeing i
read an article
in cleveland.com headlines ohio's record
number of coronal cases
coronavirus cases may be a start of a
full surge
health experts say two doctors from
metro health in cleveland talk about the
increase in cases
and what they are seeing those doctors
are with us
today first i would like
to start with dr nick grahar
medical director of the population
health innovation institute at metro
health
system doctor thank you very very much
uh
for joining us today and i wonder if you
could
kind of tell us what you know you're
seeing uh what you read from these
increase in
covet cases in ohio and and some of the
you know the data that we just just went
through yeah we're not getting the
doctor at least i'm not
we think eric should we
okay let me um we'll
hold up uh there um
let me go to dr david margolius
is the division director of internal
media medicine at
metro health system um
doctor i know you're seeing a lot of
patients and maybe you could tell us a
little bit about
what you're seeing as far as your
patients and maybe
what they have kind of collectively told
you and what you've discerned
obviously not telling us what any one
patient told you but what have you kind
of learned
uh in your in your job uh in dealing
with covid patients
sure well thanks governor dewine really
getting your message this morning
meant a lot to to all of us at metro
health
who have been caring for people with
covet and people who are worried about
getting coveted for the last six months
so i really appreciate that
so i'm the director of the covet hotline
here and
um just like the rest of the state um
we've seen
sort of waves of of of increasing
concern
um come and go and we've had a couple
good months where where we were
averaging about 50 calls a day
uh that resulted in doctor visits on the
phone
but for the last couple weeks those
those calls have doubled and
the folks that i speak to who test
positive it's a pretty similar theme
it's it's they've spent time with
friends family
indoors without masks and so it's a
pretty common theme i think it's
human nature just like you said to to
want to spend time with people
and and i my message today is it is okay
to spend time with people
but it doesn't have to be a binary
decision it doesn't have to be
yes or no if you do spend time with
people which you should
wear a mask try and be outside try and
be six feet apart
and if you do those things chances are
that it would be really
really unlikely to get kova 19 if you're
wearing a mask you're keeping your
distance and
and you spend as much time as possible
with others outside
doctor how many how many first of all
thank you for what you do
thank you know everyone metro uh
who's dealing with covet patients and
this has been a long seven and a half
months i know
so we're very very grateful for what you
all do
how many patients do you think you may
have talked to
uh during this epidemic as far as
you know people who had covet you know
roughly
yeah roughly i would say um
a couple people a day uh for
probably over 200 people who've had it
who've been diagnosed
in yesterday's cleveland.com
they quote you saying i think more and
more people are getting together
some of this is happening because
there's this urge this human
nature to get back to normal life i
think that's part of
what has been driving these surges um
and then you say later on your quote is
saying we just need these constant
reminders
uh that's still very much out there
it's not not going away and so i guess
you're
you're really talking about human nature
we all want to be together with family
we all want to be together with friends
um and and it sounds like your message
is you can still do a lot of this but
you just got to be really careful is
that
is that is that kind of your bottom line
yeah that's the message
i think you know it's a harm reduction
mentality it's it's if you're going to
spend time with people
spend time safely um you know look look
at coach kevin stevansky of the browns
you know when he wears that mask it's
it's it's there he's doing it i think
many other examples exist where you
really can
be around other people and you can do it
safely and i think
what i worry about is it's like folks
who break their diet
you know if you break your diet and have
one cheeseburger
or one candy bar you know it's probably
going to be okay
but if you break your diet and it's like
you know cheeseburger every day
that's really going to hurt you and so
it's the same thing with with
covenanting i mean you can really
be around other people but do it safely
so avoid
big crowds if you do spend time inside
with others
just everybody should wear a mask and
and hopefully we'll become more and more
comfortable with
reminding each other that you know i
think at the beginning it was a
uncomfortable conversation to say to
someone hey you know your mask is
you know not quite covering your nose
you know get that up but i think if we
really share this mentality that we're
all in this together we're doing this
for
our kids so our kids can be in school
and and our grandparents can stay
safe you know and our relatives can stay
safe and so
we're all in this together the masks
have gotten a lot more comfortable
over the last seven months you know
there are a lot more colors and such to
choose from and i i really think we can
do this
but what we've seen is this roller
coaster of all right
i haven't you know heard anyone in a
while anyone i know getting covered 19
so maybe it's kind of gone maybe i can
go back to doing what i was doing before
or doing the things that i did last year
at this time
but it's still here we're not
an island like new zealand where we can
stop new cases from coming
in and so we do have to adjust to this
new normal and that means spending time
with each other
safely that's great i
i read an article last night
and i want to read you a quote um
because i i thought this summarized it
at least from what i've been able to
learn uh fairly well uh
kind of what we have learned over the
last seven half months
and and here's the quote cover 19 is
airborne over dispersed and often
uh asymptomatic that means it spreads
mostly through
tiny spray droplets commonly produced by
people talking loudly in crowded
unventilated spaces over long periods
leading to super spreading clusters
where one sick person infects many
healthy people
that account for a large share of total
infections infected people without
symptoms might also be
super spreaders i don't know if you is
that a
fair summary do you think or do you want
to add anything to that
yeah no i think that that covers it i
mean i you know i i
on behalf of the the medical community
i'm sorry that we didn't know
more about universal masking in march
you know we didn't know it's not
something that that we learned in our
training
it's not um we i wish we had remembered
more from the 1918 influenza pandemic
but it wasn't something we learned about
and we know
so much more now you know in in
october we know about masks working
it doesn't mean that everybody has to
wear an n95 mask i mean
all it takes is this cloth mask to
prevent that type of spread that you're
describing
well doctor again thanks to you and
everybody at metro for
all you do and thanks for uh being in
our press conference today
i appreciate it very much thank you my
pleasure
we'll go back now
let me go go to dr dreher again medical
director of population health
innovation institute at metro health
system
uh doctor we hope we can hear you now
can you hear me now we can we can hear
you now
we can't we can indeed um you know we're
seeing a
this increase in covet cases in ohio i
don't know whether
i went through the data you're very
familiar with the data
um what's your take on this and and you
know from kind of the big
picture what should what should ohioans
take away from
this data i think they should by the way
yeah we we watch it all the time uh in a
different view the elephant than your
team watches the governor
but same messaging and first message is
ohio knows how to do this it's been
amazing when we have watched this since
march and been scared since marston saw
it but
i mean there was times that that other
states similar to us were 10 times the
infection rates than we were we know how
to do
this and it's the basic stuff it's it's
staying mask
it's saying social distance it's washing
your hands it's disinfecting everything
that hasn't changed i mean like david
said we
we kind of had a little misunderstanding
in march and then the mass thing got
clear and now that's clearly a big deal
we actually look at the data a little
different than you
because the strength point to us is the
hospitalization rate
yes the case rate is kind of a lead
indicator but the true rate is
hospitalization because we admit
people the same way in april as we do
now so it's a pretty consistent number
if the hospitalization rate is going up
the disease burden from covet in ohio is
going up so
in very short order ohioans know how to
do this
they can do it again we want to
encourage you to do it again
all of us do together we are all in this
together but the other thing i want the
message is
when the beds start disappearing from
covid they disappear for every disease
and it makes everybody unsafe even if
you happen to have covet and even if you
had immunity if all this happens
you don't have a bet for your heart
attack for your stroke for your
pneumonia
so it is it is a universal thing so i
just want to emphasize that and
i people ohio has done it we know how to
do we need to do it again
well thank you very much for the message
and and and doctor
again thank you for all that you you
have been doing
uh everybody at metro um i i want to be
clear because i will get some questions
in a minute uh we're not saying that
hospitals are overflowing at this point
um right absolutely not no we are
we are all in good shape and we have
planned a b and c
you know from the leadership of the
government from the leaders of other
healthcare institutions and we are all
working together
we're fine this moment but we are paid
to be paranoid as doctors
and we are worried about plan a b and c
so but we are good right this moment
but but we want to stay good by people
doing the
thoughtful thing okay very very good
well anything else you'd like to share
with us we just appreciate uh
your your time very very much and
appreciate yeah the one last thing that
we want to say though
is um you know herd immunity is sort of
a good thing but herd immunity really is
more defined
by in our standards is mostly from
vaccines in other words when there's a
hurt immunity
you know part of it is from people
getting a disease and then they're
immune
but the bigger part of it is the vaccine
you don't want to do hurt immunity by by
exposing people to the disease alone
that that just increases the number of
deaths so we are strongly supportive
of vaccine-driven herd immunity
and that we don't have that yet you know
so i know it's a confusing message to
different people but we just know from
the medical community
i want you to know herd immunity really
is we wanted to be a vaccine-driven
human immunity not a disease exposure
one so we just want that message out
there too
well and look none of us know at least i
don't know
um you know when that's coming but we're
we're hopeful
and we're hopeful when we get into next
year at some point we are
you know able to first take care of the
most vulnerable and
first responders and then as more comes
out
you know achieve whatever level we need
to achieve
in in society so at that point you and i
will be talking i hope about uh you know
encouraging people to get to get their
shots and get
immunization so that'll be a happy uh
it'll be a much happier uh
uh time so doctor thank you again very
very much
appreciate it
let me just a little bit let me at this
point let me go
let me go to lieutenant governor i know
john has some
things john hi governor
uh yes because everybody knows what
today
is today is the last day to fill out the
census
uh our our time has drawn to a close for
the 2020 census
we need to get you counted today's the
last day to do it
uh it determines how 675 billion dollars
in federal funds
uh are spent and and what portion of
that comes back to ohio
this is for schools hospitals public
roads
and public safety and bridges things
like that
and it also could determine our
political voice in washington whether we
lose a congressional seat or not so
all very important if you want to fill
out your census form
uh and be counted just like we're going
to be counted in our vote we want to be
counted in the census
uh 2020 2020census.gov 2020census.gov or
844 330-2020
for more information and i'll just close
with this
humorous thought that statistically
speaking
you don't exist unless you fill out the
census so
i hope i hope everybody will do that
and help ohio have a bigger presence
in this country by your presence in the
census
uh and then i know
that covid sometimes makes us feel like
there are
all kinds of problems out there and and
i know it can
can wear on us and we do like to
highlight the people who are going above
and beyond the call and really making
things
better for all of us and one of the
groups of people that do that are child
care centers we know
that in when the virus came that there
was a lot of questions about how to do
it safely
many child care centers stepped up and
did a wonderful job to
help moms and dads go back to work
especially those essential workers
and and to give them the peace of mind
that not only were their children going
to be safe but they were actually going
to learn
and grow and develop in that setting and
we want to highlight
one particular child care center the
children's discovery
center in lucas county who really
stepped up during this
time frame to to keep their side their
class sizes low by
by hiring new people and putting every
single protocol in place that others
learn from
to keep the environment there safe
when many schools were closing and going
to remote learning the children's
discover
children's discovery set up a virtual
learning space for kids
to come while their parents work and
they also assign teachers to help
students with their schoolwork
again one example of many
who went above and beyond to make sure
that child care worked
that children were being served that
moms and dads could go to work
and just this is a little part of how we
all chip
in do a little bit extra uh to help us
all get through this and we thank
children's discovery center and all
those
child care centers out there who are
doing that and then i'll close with this
thought we talked about mom and dad
going back to work
we know that that there's still a high
unemployment rate in ohio
but i want to reassure folks there are
opportunities out there
on ohio means jobs alone there are 158
316 jobs available 78
100 of them pay 50 000
a year or more there are also i know
that a lot of
a lot of students maybe having their
college
careers disruptive well there's still a
lot of internships out there 2 800
internships that are available right
there on ohio means jobs
now you may say hey my i know that but i
worked
in the hospitality industry there aren't
any jobs in the hospitality industry
or at least not as many as there used to
be uh for me
well we have solutions to help retrain
you for other opportunities
if you go to our individual micro
credential training program
imap the imap website you can find
training opportunities that that
courtesy of the taxpayers of ohio
we can help pay for your retraining and
you go to imap.development.ohio.gov
and look through all of the retraining
opportunities are out there
we can do them in a short period of time
do them before your unemployment runs
out
get you retrained for one of these jobs
that pay at least fifty thousand dollars
a year or more
uh we're all in this together and these
are just some
some examples of how we can do that and
how we can move forward
back to you governor thank you very much
we'll
go to questions
governor first question today is from
spencer hickey at hannah news service
thank you governor on last thursday
you announced a new order on a nursing
home indoor visitation
and i was just wondering if you could go
over the details of that
given that it was kind of mentioned
towards the end and
don't think it had been discussed too
much i know some facilities have opted
not to open for indoor visits yet
yeah i will i will do the best i can
but for a more accurate rendition
people should look at our web page where
we we specifically
outline it the goal
has been to try to safely
have people in nursing homes have
visitors and
it's been one of the most heartbreaking
things frankly that's occurred we closed
the
nursing homes to visitors early early on
when the virus was coming in we did that
to save lives
but we also know there's been a lot of
agony because of that when people can't
see their family
so we went to outdoor visitation when
the weather was better
and when we did that we're moving from
there
now to to indoor visitation um
and a lot of it is within the discretion
of the nursing home they have to be able
to have the people that
are necessary to do this but we
encourage all the nursing homes to you
know make
make a provision for this to be done so
that people can visit
their family members uh it's you know
it's very very very important and i'll
i'll um we'll get you
i'll get you the next time and i'll just
read the specific
uh details but it was worked out along
with the nursing homes
um and the whole whole idea is to
open it up but do it in a in a safe way
and that's our constant constant
challenge as we
as we do these things
next question is from andy chow at ohio
public radio and television
andy hi governor um i'm wondering if you
could talk a little bit more about
testing it seemed like last week the
state was averaging about
40 000 tests a day but seems to have
dropped off in numbers as
far as we can tell from the dashboard is
there an effort by the state to try to
ramp up testing again to encourage
people
to to get testing as a more of a
preventive measure
yeah you know we now
uh are in the process of dispersing
uh 228 000 i think was the figure
uh of the new test from the white house
these the strip tests
and we've kind of outlined how those are
going to be utilized they're going to be
used to some extent our nursing homes
we'll try to we're going to use them
some of our colleges are going to use
them as well
to ramp up their testing capacity
we're also going to use those tests um
in
other areas where if we see a surge we
see a problem
uh develop we'll be able to move in with
those tests so
you're going to see these numbers go up
just because of those alone
we've also got other things that are
going on
where we're going to continue to see the
testing go up so
i think i don't know the exact average
andy for the last seven days but our
last 10 days but
you know we're significantly higher than
we were we've sort of hit a plateau now
we've got to kick it to kick this thing
up again
and continue the the testing so we're
gonna
we are focused on more and more and more
testing faster we can get it out and we
can get
out in in in the correct way uh we're
going to use that i mean it's going to
for example in the nursing homes
it's going to significantly increase the
how often
for example we are testing employees
it's going to increase uh and allow
ohio to comply with what what the
guidelines are from the federal
government is if you
get a case what you have to do and
federal government
provides for very intensive testing
after that until you clear out there's
no cases left
and we're fine with that we're going to
deploy a lot of these tests
to do that so you're going to see the
numbers go up
next question is from jeff redick at
wsyx
in columbus afternoon governor
uh preface this by acknowledging what
you had said
uh last week that the future of the
state's economy will depend on people's
confidence to go out or not
but on last thursday
you had said we're not going to shut
down this economy again we're not
then on tuesday you were asked about
could there be any more lockdown
measures this winter and you said yeah
there could be
will you commit to not authoring any
other
state ordered shutdowns or lockdown
measures or are you not making that
commitment
no thanks for the question i'll try to
clarify it
um we don't have any plans to do
shutdowns
uh but no governor can stand up here
during a pandemic
and and you know say under no
circumstances will we
shut something down and that just that
would be irresponsible we have no plans
uh to shut anything down we believe
as you heard from the from the doctors
uh
that there is a safe way to do most of
the things that we
as ohioans want to do and we just ask
people to do those
uh look what you're seeing in today's
numbers
should
get our attention there's a red tide
flowing all over the state of ohio
and virtually everybody in ohio is now
living
in in a high incident uh
high rate of spread area and
that's something that we can do
something about though it is not
inevitable
this spread of the virus in ohio can be
slowed down it can be reversed
it's totally within our hands to do it
we have the ability to do it
distancing wearing a mask
when you're inside you know make sure
that you're getting some air from the
outside
in and these are wash your hands these
are
basic things as the doctor said a moment
ago
from metro most things we can do
i mean people talking about thanksgiving
if you're going to do it safely you're
probably not going to do it exactly like
you've done it before but you can still
do
something you can still you know have
friends uh but you're gonna have to do
it differently
yeah if we're gonna be safe and and
that's
you know when we look at these numbers
um this is the worst situation ohio has
been
in and more ohioans are vulnerable today
than ever before because of how far the
spread has
has gone there are very few ohioans who
can say wow
i live somewhere where there's no you
know there's no covet and
there's no spread and as
was indicated doctor indicated
we've learned a lot you know we've
learned a lot the medical community has
learned a lot in the last seven and a
half months
we have always tried to tell people what
we knew
but doctors were telling us medical
experts were telling us but they have
learned
and as they have learned we have tried
to continue to you know
keep people informed so we can
live our lives safely schools can stay
open but it's pretty hard to keep
schools open
when you had massive spread of the covet
in your community
no matter how good those schools are
those teachers are
superintendent principal no matter how
hard they're working to keep their kids
safe if it's out in the community it's
going to get in the school
same way with nursing homes you know it
comes from the community
uh and if we can lower that rate in the
community we lessen the chance that gets
into our nursing homes
so it's these are things that we can do
these are things that we can do we got
to be careful
but we can do them
next question is from ben schwartz at
wcpo in cincinnati
hi governor a large er yeah a large
number of
ohioans in the tri-state area and around
cincinnati have to travel
to indiana for work every day yesterday
the ohio department of health put out an
advisory asking
ohioans to self-quarantine after
visiting states with a 15 percent covet
positivity rate or above
indiana is one of those states so what
should ohioans who have to travel to
indiana or other states like that
regularly
what should they do in this situation
yeah ben
even even when we had uh our more
stringent
order early on uh we certainly made
exceptions for people who are commuting
to work
people traveling back and forth now that
we have a
state that's on our border that has that
high incidence
it mostly serves really as a warning
uh and you know if you look at the
counties that border
indiana they're also some of our highest
uh positivity counties and highest
incident counties
uh but we just we put this out uh to
tell people if you're going in
any of these states it's above 15
positivity you should know that
and you should you know adjust your
behavior accordingly it just simply
tells you that there is significant
spread very significant high spread
in in that particular state so again
like
our color code it is a warning
it is a caution that's really what it's
for
next question is from jim province at
the toledo blade
thanks again governor i appreciate this
um it's been three months to the day
since you held your special televised
address to ohioans to urge them to wear
masks
and to practice social distancing and
that was
after ohio hit another infection record
and before you and it also came before
you issued a statewide mass order
what does it say about our progress that
we've been that we're back in this
position again
in october well it means people are
tired they're sick of the
the sick of the virus and they want to
get on with their lives and and i get it
but i i think you know that the history
that you just described is very
instructive
because three months ago i gave the
speech and then
after that we started putting orders on
in regard to masked worry very
controversial a lot of people still
upset about it i understand that
but here's what we found uh we found
what we thought we would find
and that is when those orders went on
people started wearing their masks more
and initially jim when those were put on
those were mostly urban
counties that were red and those urban
counties
very quickly went from a compliance
maybe an average of 50 55 percent to
maybe 85 percent
when that compliance rate went up we
started seeing cases
then after that start to go back down
and so ohioans have done this
before we have been here before we know
what works
wearing a mask works keeping a distance
keeping some discipline washing your
hands
all of these things work and if we can
do these again at a high level
uh we'll we'll knock this virus right
back
uh but this virus is coming on
really strong now and it's coming on
strong all throughout
the state of ohio and so what we did
before
we can do again this is really the third
big challenge
our first challenge was you know ohioans
basically stay home you control this
thing
we did that ohioans did that did it
phenomenally well
the second one was was as you said three
months ago
and i gave the speech then we started
putting
you know mass quarters on and ohioans
rose to the challenge again
and started wearing the mask at a much
higher compliance and because of that
we knocked it down again
now we've got a really high rate
and it's moving fast and we can do it
again
we've been through this and one of the
reasons i i like the ad
that our two coaches did um uh
her admirer jim tressel uh because
that's the emphasis of hey we're tough
we're ohioans we can do this
we got to hang in there and that's
really
where this game is we can see the end
and we don't know exactly what it's
going to be but it's it's we
certainly think it's going to be next
year and we certainly think we're going
to have the
have the vaccine we're going to get the
vaccine out to to
enough people so at some point then
the world gets back to where we want it
to be
but our goal should be to have all of us
who are
alive right now make it and be there and
be there at the end
and we can do that and we can do it
without
destroying what we love in fact the
virus is the biggest threat to our
schools the virus is the biggest threat
to our loved ones in nursing homes the
virus is the biggest threat to our
economy
and when we recognize that
when we put on a mask and do do what we
have to do
this is our pathway to freedom it's our
pathway to keep the economy going it's
our pathway to keep our kids in school
it's a pathway to keep our kids in
college it's a pathway to
do the things that we want to do and if
the virus
continues to roar through ohio you know
we're not going to be able to do those
things so i i think it's
this is the third big challenge we've
faced it's here
it's i've tried to describe it today and
describe it in the last several
sessions the data clearly shows it but
we can overcome it
we can clearly overcome it because we've
overcome it before
next question is from jesse ballmer at
the cincinnati enquirer
hello governor um my question is there's
a group of
lawmakers in the senate introducing
legislation to lift
that 10 pm last call or early bar
closures
could you maybe respond to that or and
give an update on
your review of that issue yeah
look um we'll talk about that next week
um fully understand
um i mean no one fully understands
unless they're in the business but
i i've talked to enough bar owners
people who own restaurants
to understand that this has had an
adverse impact on them and we're looking
for ways frankly to help them
financially and we hope to be able to
talk about something next week now we're
never going to be able to put them make
them whole
we're never going to be able to make up
that money but we need to help
and i intend to help them and i want to
talk with the legislature
about the best way to to help them
because
they are in a unique position we've had
a lot of small businesses that have been
hurt but they've they've been hurt very
specifically
uh because of our need for the public
good
to close the bars at 10 o'clock
um i've spent the last several days
talking to a lot of people who would be
directly impacted by that
and this is going to be something that
you know i just
don't think that we're going to be able
to do at this point
we get this virus down uh we certainly
will be able to
to do that uh but we got to get it down
and we got to get control of it um but
we're working
i've been working with the lieutenant
governor and i uh
and we want to take something to the
legislature in the next several days
and work with them to come up with some
financial help for those
those those bars and those restaurants
so
uh you know this these numbers um
you know candidly i thought we would be
able to lift that this
but when you look at these numbers these
numbers are just
horrible and they're going the wrong way
and we
just can't do it at this point
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
hey governor the state of ohio doesn't
require
health care providers to report specific
vaccinations
to the state and i'm wondering if you
think that's something the legislature
should consider
changing in preparation for a coveted
vaccine and
why or why not you know i'm not really
looked at that
um and i'll get back to you on that but
i i you know one of the things that
you know we want to be able to know uh
is all kinds of data like that
and so you gotta protect people's he
protect people's privacy
uh but knowing numbers uh
you know what percentage of people that
uh you know have received a vaccination
uh is certainly very important it's it's
a question that you know i know i
ask our team in regard to flu uh
well baby shots uh these are all things
that you know
the legislature needs to know and the
governor needs to know and the people of
ohio need to know because they affect
the health of all of us
so i'll get back to you on that but
certainly
more information is better
next question is from john london at
wlwt in cincinnati
hi governor i've tried to listen to you
really carefully here today i've heard
you
say this is the worst situation ohio has
been in
you said red tide flowing across the
state no county has gone purple
governor and despite the dramatic higher
numbers and the positivity no
changes have been made in the rules or
the guidelines and i'm wondering what
you're prepared to do if the numbers
keep going up
what would be at risk and what's your
trigger point are we
close to that now
you know john um
there's a limit to what a governor could
do or should do
um and we're at the point
where we have to live with this virus
the consequences of going in and
shutting things down again
would be devastating not just
financially but devastating to people
in their individual lives so we do not
want to be in a position to do that
but let me make it really clear this is
not a situation
where we don't know what to do this is
not a situation where we don't know what
works
thank heavens we know what works and
we've learned it
the hard way we've learned it an
agonizing seven and a half months
but there is now a real real consensus
among health experts the medical
community the world over
about the things that we can do that
can keep this virus down and they lie
within each and every
one of ohio citizens each and every one
of us
has the power to change the future
when you look at the data today the
future that that paints is
ugly it is not good
um it will be
a tough very tough tough
november december january maybe february
who knows how long
we can avoid most of this pain
we can avoid
losing a lot more people than we should
be losing
but we've got to do the basic things
we've got to wear mask in public
we've got to keep a distance we've got
to not go to
events that look look like fun
but where you're going to have family or
friends there
at least that are big gatherings and if
you can keep gatherings outside
i know it's getting colder but if you
keep some things outside
but at the very you know we're a mask
this mask if both people are wearing
masks
the data the more data i see the better
the better this this looks um
and so we all have within ourselves
the power uh to live with this
which is really what we have to do so
i'm
you know i hope that the data we showed
today
um will kind of be a wake-up call
uh to every ohioan uh that this is real
it's real in your county um
and but we have it within our capacity
to change the outcome we can change the
future
unlike the weather we can't change the
weather we can sure change we get a
forecast we've got a bad forecast today
but we can change the outcome we just
got to do it
next question is from a man and alan at
wews in cleveland
hey governor so you keep talking about
spread coming from weddings and funerals
um and i know just a couple of questions
ago and the question you just answered
from john
you talked about not shutting shutting
anything else down but
can we expect some sort of order banning
gatherings soon
well we already got an order on uh you
know there's a there's a there's a 10
person limit
uh you know we made the exception for
weddings funerals religious services the
services themselves
but not the party afterwards so there's
an order on now
that tells people that we need you need
to limit this
so you know there's some exceptions but
again you know it's like we talked about
two days ago on tuesday
you know a lot of this is gatherings of
people you know we don't have the
ability to go into people's homes we
don't want to go into people's homes
um and it's the same way of weddings um
you know these are what we hope is that
people look at this and say look
you know and make personal decisions and
accommodate
everyone's health you know is it worth
it to have a large wedding
where there's no social distance
can't you have a wedding people have
masks on keep some distance
still have the wedding still have the
same people there i mean there's ways of
doing
all of these things you know i'm not out
here telling people to
to you know change what they they do
other than
figuring out how to do it safer and
ohioans are you know have great
ingenuity
uh you know they they can figure out how
to do
about anything and we know if we keep in
mind the
four or five basic principles of how we
slow this spread down
we can do about anything that we want to
do as long as we do it carefully and
within the confines of what good public
health is
question is from james pilcher at wkrc
in cincinnati
good afternoon governor this fall when
you opened up
sports you said everybody needs to be
held accountable
but we've learned that almost half the
schools observed by ohsaa
are not following your mandates yet
there's been no consequences for that
non-compliance
so who holds these schools accountable
is it your office
is it ohsaa and how do they do it
and as a follow-up on the nursing home
question that was asked earlier
how do you feel like the new center
program where the
each county has a center for covet
patients is working and do you feel like
families are being notified well enough
uh that
covid patients are coming into those
centers thank you yeah yeah are you
are you hearing that they're not being
notified um we've heard
from a few that they're not but then i
talked to
uh a couple of administrators who said
they are putting out one call so there
is some
there is some complaining about it but
i'm trying to nail down
okay um go ahead let me give you a rain
check on that until tuesday and i'll
have an opportunity to reach out
and find out what our team knows about
that i'll find out what director mcelroy
and others know
about that as far as the ohio high
school athletic association
john do you know anything about any
reports back from them
you know james was talking about a
significant number i think you need
a number that were not in compliance and
that there were problems
yeah i don't have the latest report from
from them but here was we had long
discussions with the ohio high school
athletic association
about what the standards were for return
to play
and what the expectations were for
observation and accountability and
that lies with the ohio high school
athletic association
the the tools that they promised they
would use were
things like disqualifications
forfeitures
uh suspension of seasons uh and
particularly now that
that many of these events are into
playoff season
i would hope uh and look we we want them
to have fun we want them to have the
games
but we we have to make sure that the
rules are being followed
and look it's to the it's in the best
interest of the schools that
these rules are being followed because
if you don't follow them
you're going to have a spread you're
going to end up with
coaches or players who are going to get
the virus you're going to end up with
other people around them who end up
quarantined
and you'll cost yourself your own season
so
we will but i will in response to the
question
do a follow up with the ohio high school
athletic association get the latest
report
and come back with
what we learned from those conversations
next question is from laura bischoff at
the dayton daily news
hello hey governor um so
most my questions were asked by my
colleagues uh so i'll go with this one
um you talk about thanksgiving is it can
be done uh but done differently
uh what do you think your thanksgiving
is gonna look like this year
yeah you know it's gonna be fran pie in
a giant dwine zoom meeting
or rapid tests for everybody who attends
or maybe
like a dewine family bubble like the nba
what's the plan yeah we're not really
sure fran you'll answer that
no friend's not ready to answer that yet
uh look i
you know i'll tell you you know we we
did uh
our daughters did something for uh our
three daughters and and two of them uh
put on a shower for another daughter
and um you know they did it did outside
it was kind of a drive-through um and um
you know everybody seemed to have fun
but people would drive kind of drive
through
and uh and you know nobody ever got too
close to each other and we were outside
and we had
had everybody had masks on so some
people said they preferred that type of
shower in the future so i don't know
that will catch on or not but it seemed
to seem to work very well but
you know i i suspect and i hope fran
will be cooking
and uh uh all the all the
family members are good cooks and uh we
got a lot of
a lot of good cooks in the family but uh
it's gonna be different i mean you know
we can't uh we probably will have some
who
uh you know live a distance away may not
come uh
and um you know we'll see but we're
gonna have to have it
it's gonna have to be spread out and
we're gonna have to you know be very
concerned about families
intermixing so we'll let you know when
we get the plan
next question is from josh roltenberg at
spectrum news
hi governor this question is actually
for the lieutenant governor john husted
um lieutenant governor you've been at
two political events now within the last
month the one in cleveland with the
debate and then the pence event on
monday
uh in both circumstances there was
inconsistencies in the
and the people that were social
distancing and also wearing masks
um i'm just curious because we've talked
about accountability here
um how can you stress accountability for
ohioans
in everyday life but not to the trump
campaign at different events
well i can reassure you that i've
done my level best to practice what we
preach i've worn
masks tried to keep my distance from
folks
i know it's a complicated matter right
now with political campaigns going on
but you know i can't you know look the
the political events
are allowed to occur under the order
uh we have tried to set a good example
i stood up in front of a hostile crowd
and asked them to wear masks
much to my own peril as they didn't
think much of my suggestion
but i i you know that's the
the best the best thing that we can do
is to try to
act as good examples i've tried to do
that and
and believe that is consistent with what
we've been saying
next question is from jake zuckerman at
the ohio capitol journal
hi governor case loads hospital rolls
death counts positivity
i mean all the indicators are moving in
the wrong direction
is there any kind of policy or strategic
change underway or are we just kind of
betting it all
that people change their habits this
latent game
well look there's there's well
dolly is dally is commenting on like
what i'm doing i guess anyway hello
dolly um
there's three things really going on i
think
one is is certainly beyond
our control and that is what
the companies are doing uh in regard to
coming up with the vaccine
uh that's coming two
is what people do it's the most
important thing
because the most barring
having the medical solution uh
the shot you know it comes back to what
we all do
we know what works we know mass work
uh and literally if 80 percent of the
people of this state
would wear masks and be careful we'd
knock these numbers
down dramatically
the other thing is you know incumbent
upon us
and local health departments and mayors
and everyone else but
but i take the lead and that is to get
testing
out and get testing and make it
available
throughout the state and have it done in
a strategic
way that accomplishes two things uh
one is those tests have to be deployed
and are being deployed to save lives
directly
so the most vulnerable population are
nursing homes for example
and the other you know is to you know
slow community spread
make sure that we're hitting uh
underserved populations
national guard is is helping us do that
but a lot is going on in regard to
testing right now
as we deploy new tests and we continue
to look at other ways to get more
testing
so that's on us things are going okay
we just need to keep kicking it up and
kicking it up
next question is from jack windsor at
wmfd in mansfield
hey jack hi governor you reviewed the
advisory system and pointed out
there are a few indicators that are
flagged in many of the rick counties
of those two can be triggered by
non-coveted illnesses
outpatient visits and emergency
department visits
and three of them are tied to tasks now
those new tests you mentioned we're
getting
and using the fda guidance says they
pick up bacterial infection
viral fragments that are old and not
contagious and even non-covate viruses
and the fda warns that a positive test
needs to be considered other factors
five of the seven indicators governor on
the system are wobbling so how do we
know
we're not getting right indicators and
high incidence warnings based on
non-coveted illnesses and positive tests
that are either false
or lack additional uh consideration
you have system is perfect um and this
is not perfect
uh you know but this was put together
uh with advice from national experts
from people in the trump administration
um
to come up with a way to measure
um using a number of different
indicators so you weren't just relying
on one
to tell the people in the community
exactly where they are
we think this system works works very
well
um you know we also tell people to look
at the number of cases
in that community that's very very
important as you heard one of the
doctors talk about from their
perspective
uh very understandably it's the number
of
people going into the hospital
and so you know by all indications we're
headed the wrong direction if you look
at just the people going into the
hospital
which is a lagging indicator
death would be the last lagging
indicator farthest lagging but
going into hospitals pretty far along i
mean you've already
you've been exposed and then you've you
know you've come up with symptoms
usually and then you're tested
and then maybe you get really sick and
anyway you end up in the hospital
so the the number of of covet patients
in the hospital today
is about double what it was not too long
ago so
we're not no one's saying we're
overflowing with patients
but that's a that's an indicator that
you know is a solid solid solid
indicator we think the other ones are
solid too but you just count the number
of people in the hospital
from from from covet
we use the other indicators frankly
because that's a lagging indicator
we need to we need to see what's early
on going on so at least we can
give give the community some indication
of which way
which way they're going and so every
indicator
is going the wrong way on us
right now next question is from laura
hancock
at cleveland.com hello governor
hey laura hi um poll workers have been
told
this was like in august that they um
cannot ask people to wear masks
at polling places it was directed from
secretary frank larose
um now there's a surge and people are
early voting
um if there's a statewide mass mandate
why can't
we make people wear masks at polls
yeah i think my understanding i've
talked to the secretary of state uh
franklin rose about this
is that you know people are told to wear
a mask
when the when they're voting they're
told to wear a mask in line if they're
waiting in line
all the people working there wearing
masks but i think
when asked the question would you deny
someone the right to vote
who would not wear a mask his answer was
no we would not
deny them the right to vote and i think
you know we get into some other
very serious constitutional issues
when we if we would say we're going to
deny you the right to vote
if you did not have a mask so i think
that
you know everyone's told to wear a mask
everyone's expected to wear a mask will
there be someone
you know or some people who show up and
don't worry i suppose
uh but that's that's not what
we're telling people to do but if you
get down to the question are you gonna
throw that person out you're gonna tell
them you cannot vote
it's election day whatever day it is
you're not going to vote
we're not going to allow you to vote
without a mask what the secretary of
state has said and
i don't disagree is we're not going to
deny that person the right to vote
but we're asking them please wear a mask
governor look we've got if i could just
we've got we've got poll workers are
going to be there 15 hours
uh or so and 13 of those hours the polls
are open
they're going to be exposed to a lot of
lot of people
and so you know it's just not right to
walk in there
and not have a mask on john yeah
that's exactly right you know we need to
respect each other
uh protect each other and i think the
process will work is if you come
in you will be offered a mask if you
don't have one
uh if at that point uh you don't want to
wear a mask then i think they will
encourage you to vote curbside because
there is a curbside option
for voting so that you don't have to be
in the facility without a mask
uh and at that point after the poll
workers exhaust
all of their options uh for trying to
get somebody to cast a vote in a
in a safer manner then they would
just allow the person to vote because
you can't deny them
that opportunity and and that's the
procedure that will be followed
next question is from dan perlman at
wcmh
in columbus hi governor
earlier today you said that there are
several red counties that
have formal events planned such as club
crawls political events art affairs
and now is the time to rethink whether
those should go
on focusing on political events would
you
urge political candidates from both
parties to refrain from holding these
events
here in ohio and would you attend a
rally or event
given the situation that we are in right
now
well our message is consistent
uh what we've said whether we're talking
about political rally a demonstration
uh you know anything like that
as far as exercising first amendment
rights
and that is please everyone more mask
we've asked organizers to you know make
sure
people have the opportunity to wear a
mask they're encouraged to wear a mask
and
should wear a mask um and so i would
hope
that um you know i wouldn't say that we
shouldn't joe biden shouldn't come into
ohio or the president shouldn't come or
the vice presidential candidate
shouldn't come i would never say that
uh what i should would say though and i
am saying is that
look we need to be careful uh and we
need to keep
have events where people can keep a
distance we need to try to do them
outside
and we need to you know have a strict
adherence to wearing a mask
i mean that's what we have told every
every group
um and sometimes you know people listen
more than they they do
other times but um you know that's the
message it's pretty simple
uh you can have these rallies you can
have uh you know the opportunity to
to do these things which is part of um
you know the month of october
and early early early november as these
campaigns
wind down uh you know this is what we
expect to see particularly if we live in
ohio because ohio's always a
battleground state so i'm not saying
this shouldn't occur
but there's ways of doing it and we just
encourage everybody to do it in a safe
a safe way next question is from alex
ebert at bloomberg
hey governor sorry for the delay there
um
we've heard some trepidation it seems
between the medical experts that we've
had on today and yourself
saying that we're not at the point where
we should be concerned about
hospitals being overflowing but it also
seems like we're not ruling that out in
the future
what are the medical experts telling you
about the chances for that happening in
the future
if these statistics don't go in a better
direction for ohio thank you
well i don't know that i've asked that
specific question
but there's grave concern with these
with these numbers several doctors were
quoting the paper
you can see by the quotes that they have
very significant
significant concerns
we prepared well in the spring
for a surge that because of what ohioans
did we
didn't get thank heavens unlike other
states
but these numbers are terrible i mean
this is alarming
and they've come up very quickly
very quickly and it's not just one
alarm going off this is every alarm
going off right now
so we have the ability to turn this
thing around
and it's pretty simple what we need to
do we need to wear a mask
we need to be careful uh we need to
protect each other
and we can we can do that but
you know we we had a build out of
hospitals
that we didn't need uh everybody's still
got their plan
everybody's still ready to go if they
have to go
but uh you know we certainly hope we
don't we don't need that but i know
there's grave concern with doctors
there's a very serious concern
uh with people in the medical community
i i have
talked about and look there's a lot of
ways of measuring this
um you know the worst case scenario
uh is that we overflow our hospitals and
people can't get other care
somebody has a heart attack can't they
can't find a bid for them
uh and that we we're making tough
decisions about who gets
you know uh how we're treating people so
we're not treating them as well as we
might be
able to but there's other scenarios too
that are less dire that are still
bad uh and that is you know we get
a lot of people a lot more people who
die i mean my goal
and i think it should be the gold area
ohioan man let's get through this
let's get through it let's see the
sunshine
let's see other uh opening day baseball
games and let's
have the opportunity to go to weddings
and in
baptisms and and enjoy our family i mean
you know if we're not here we can't
enjoy that
and so uh we got a lot of lives at stake
uh you know it's not just whether or not
the the uh hospitals are overflowing or
not that's important
but there's other things to worry about
as well
so let me let me go to our clothes as we
close today i want to share
a picture we received a nine-year-old
girl named claire who is
from gahanna and let me just read it
wear a mask stay six feet apart
stay healthy ohio we can beat this
ohio i love it claire's done a great job
of capturing what we need to do
we can't in fact beat this ohio we know
what to do
we have done it before we can do it
again
one phrase that dr atkin used that
became popular is not all heroes
wear capes not all heroes or capes
that is true everybody in ohio can be a
hero
to protect each other if we wear a mask
distance
frequent hand washing and be careful to
end today we have the university of
cincinnati
marching band playing a piece called
summon the heroes
by american composer john williams who
wrote it for the 1996
olympic games with or without a cape
you can be a hero
