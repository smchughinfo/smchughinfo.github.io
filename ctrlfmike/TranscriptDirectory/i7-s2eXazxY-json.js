    "moderna with their drug trials",
    "proceeding very well 95",
    "pfizer the week before so that's very",
    "very good news help",
    "is truly uh on the way for us in ohio",
    "and across",
    "across the country so very very very",
    "good news",
    "the bad news is that uh our situation in",
    "ohio is deteriorating",
    "um we see more and more cases more and",
    "more people in the hospital",
    "and we've got we've got to turn turn",
    "this thing around",
    "we literally have to build",
    "a bridge to get from here to",
    "the point when we're going to have the",
    "immunity",
    "from the vaccine so we got to get we got",
    "to get over this we got to get over this",
    "bad",
    "bad spot i'm going to talk today about",
    "some of the things that",
    "we can do and it sounds like reports i'm",
    "getting around ohio we're already",
    "starting to",
    "to do that more and more people are",
    "wearing masks and retail",
    "outlets which is just great great great",
    "news",
    "so let's um eric eric is back",
    "good to see you eric let's take a look",
    "at",
    "the numbers let's go to today's slide uh",
    "seven thousand cases this has been",
    "running between",
    "seven and eight thousand uh for about a",
    "week",
    "um six weeks ago we were",
    "at about a thousand so it's gone up",
    "dramatically",
    "a number of deaths sadly at 30",
    "hospitalizations uh way up 368",
    "we'll talk about hospitalizations in a",
    "moment those people in the hospital",
    "21 day average was only was 210 and icu",
    "admissions is up",
    "a little bit as well let's talk a little",
    "bit",
    "about hospitalization",
    "october 13th we had a thousand people",
    "in our hospitals in ohio who had covet",
    "uh november 5th that number was 2000.",
    "by november 12th that number had gone",
    "from 2 000",
    "to 3 000. and you look at",
    "today's number 3648",
    "so this is just as you can tell",
    "going up dramatically uh you'll see",
    "that the yellow is the icu",
    "and that's going up certainly as well",
    "and you'll see",
    "covered positive hospitalized is the is",
    "the purple",
    "so just a dramatic dramatic change i",
    "spent yesterday",
    "traveling around in some of the",
    "southeastern parts of the state as well",
    "as the northwestern part",
    "of ohio i had doctors with me to stop",
    "and each one of them describe what they",
    "were seeing in their",
    "in their local local hospital uh let's",
    "let's uh the icu let me give you the icu",
    "numbers",
    "um one month ago we had 280",
    "of our fellow ohioans and icu uh",
    "today we have 900 so a dramatic",
    "dramatic increase of those in that",
    "in that situation so eric let's take a",
    "look at the next one",
    "this is our slide of course 88 counties",
    "ranked by highest occurrence and again",
    "as you'll see",
    "every single county every single county",
    "is now a high incidence",
    "and these numbers continue to go up even",
    "for the counties that have",
    "the least spread if you look here",
    "makes county for example still",
    "these are high these are high numbers",
    "every every county in the state is at",
    "least two times the",
    "the high incident level set by the cdc",
    "eric let's look at the",
    "top 20. and if you look at the top 20",
    "these are astronomical numbers",
    "um you know if you look at the top five",
    "putnam mercer allen lake all glazed",
    "um it you know these numbers are just",
    "shocking it means that one out of 100",
    "people in the last two weeks",
    "i was diagnosed with coba so",
    "just think about the odds and we know",
    "that's always lower than",
    "not everybody's diagnosed not everyone",
    "has the test",
    "and so what that means is that",
    "dramatically increases the chance of",
    "someone in those",
    "counties uh running into somebody uh who",
    "does in fact have the coven and again",
    "it's it's the reason for the mask it's",
    "the reason for the",
    "for the distancing all right eric let's",
    "take a look at the next",
    "slide um this is something we've shown",
    "before",
    "uh i believe this is cases versus",
    "testing this shows",
    "we're very happy to see the testing",
    "going up and it continues to go up",
    "but it a number of cases is going up",
    "much more",
    "obviously much more dramatically so we",
    "have some people who think that the",
    "increase in testing is what's causing",
    "the increase in cases",
    "yeah a little bit of it but most of it",
    "uh is",
    "more and more cases um so let's take a",
    "look at the next",
    "slide here um so this is number",
    "number again test perform and you can",
    "see these numbers are going",
    "way way up we're happy certainly happy",
    "about that",
    "and the positivity number the seven day",
    "running average is 12.8 positivity",
    "uh the last day was 13.8",
    "so certainly not heading in the right",
    "direction",
    "so let's talk a little bit uh about",
    "building that bridge to get us",
    "across until we get uh to the",
    "point when we start",
    "not only getting start getting testing",
    "out or excuse me getting vaccinations",
    "out",
    "but get them out enough so that we're",
    "starting to get that",
    "herd immunity so it's a ways away but",
    "the good news is it is coming",
    "and it's great great news that we got",
    "this weekend in last",
    "week well we started down that path last",
    "week",
    "with our retail mass order we had",
    "inspectors go out yesterday for the",
    "first day",
    "again our goal is to protect the workers",
    "in the retail establishments also to",
    "protect customers when they",
    "when they go in it's the right thing to",
    "do",
    "with every county now being hot",
    "every county now having very significant",
    "spread the good news is that we have had",
    "some reports that even before monday",
    "when it started to be enforced we were",
    "starting to see",
    "a number of case number of people who",
    "were wearing masks in retail",
    "establishments",
    "uh go up and i've got some emails from",
    "some folks who have been in in these",
    "different",
    "retail establishments and some of them",
    "so that's great we just encourage people",
    "to continue",
    "to do that we issue reissued last week",
    "the",
    "uh order that people should not come",
    "together",
    "you know 10 or more people",
    "that has to do of course with what",
    "wedding receptions and",
    "and funerals again not impacting the",
    "wedding",
    "receptions or the weddings themselves",
    "the ceremony",
    "nor the funerals but uh the receptions",
    "the getting together uh the order simply",
    "says",
    "that it has to follow",
    "basically the restaurant protocol",
    "there's a few additional tweaks in there",
    "but it's basically people need to wear",
    "masks when they're not",
    "actively eating they need to be seated",
    "they need to be careful and we think",
    "that will",
    "help when people follow that as well as",
    "we've seen a lot a lot of tragedy come",
    "out",
    "sadly uh out of out of weddings and out",
    "of out of funerals and spread coming",
    "from from that what else can we do",
    "i i think really if we could summarize",
    "what we need to do",
    "it's we're a mask and have fewer",
    "contacts",
    "uh what do i mean by that well think",
    "back to the spring",
    "we did some shutdown people stayed home",
    "not looking anything that drastic",
    "but we know that if we reduce the number",
    "of people we come in contact",
    "every day with that we",
    "reduce the chances of getting the virus",
    "and we reduce the chances of spreading",
    "the virus if we unknowingly",
    "have it you can look back",
    "in the spring you look back in in in",
    "march april uh and you just saw activity",
    "went down and we're not talking about",
    "closing any businesses as we did then",
    "but what we are asking every ohioan to",
    "do",
    "uh is to limit your activity limit your",
    "contacts",
    "with other ohios so how we going to do",
    "that",
    "we are issuing a curfew",
    "and the curfew will start",
    "thursday at 10 p.m so the curfew every",
    "day",
    "for 21 days we're gonna try it for 21",
    "days see how",
    "how we're doing for 21 days three weeks",
    "at 10 pm uh retail establishments",
    "need to be closed and people should be",
    "home",
    "that will run until 5 a.m i know a lot",
    "of people like to get up and exercise",
    "and do things that's great um",
    "we believe that this is going to help",
    "it's going to reduce some of the",
    "contacts that are taking place",
    "um what else what else can be done can",
    "be done",
    "so i'm asking in addition to the curfew",
    "itself",
    "i'm asking each ohioan every day",
    "to do at least one thing that reduces",
    "your contact",
    "with others or one thing that enhances",
    "your",
    "personal contact with someone",
    "your emotional contact with them but not",
    "a physical contact",
    "um what what are we talking about let me",
    "give",
    "maybe some examples that i just wrote",
    "down today",
    "you're thinking about going watching the",
    "ohio state game with a bunch of friends",
    "don't do it pull back watch watch",
    "that at home talk about on the phone",
    "skype in if you want to talk back and",
    "forth about it but",
    "but pull back um",
    "we're a master church again",
    "something that people can do call a",
    "friend",
    "just talk to a friend uh lord chris",
    "is going to talk a little bit later",
    "today",
    "about some of the mental health toll",
    "that's going on during this pandemic and",
    "what people can do to",
    "to alleviate that something you can do",
    "write a letter",
    "write a letter somewhat people like to",
    "get mail they don't get",
    "a handwritten note very often give them",
    "give them a mat",
    "again something positive that we can do",
    "uh during this time",
    "something we did back uh in the spring",
    "we consolidated trips",
    "um talking to someone the other day uh",
    "they said you know in the spring i would",
    "have made one trip to the grocery store",
    "yeah this week i've made two maybe three",
    "so you can buy the same amount of stuff",
    "we want to help help the merchants but",
    "make a list consolidate it these are",
    "just simple things everyone can come up",
    "with their own list um",
    "so i'm i'm really asking and we're",
    "asking every ohioan to do",
    "one thing at least or two or three that",
    "cuts down the contact",
    "every single day um ask what you can do",
    "for your fellow man that's what you can",
    "do",
    "for the people uh of ohio and we are",
    "all in this together and what each one",
    "of us does will make a difference",
    "we don't have to cut these contacts down",
    "by as much as we did in the spring but",
    "if we can cut it down",
    "say 20 25 we're going to have a",
    "significant impact",
    "and you couple that with what we really",
    "didn't know",
    "in the spring and that was that these",
    "masks work really well",
    "and so you couple the mask with that",
    "a couple of the cutting down on the",
    "number of contacts",
    "and you know that's going to go a long",
    "way",
    "to keeping our hospitals from being",
    "overrun it's going to go a long way to",
    "keep our kids in school",
    "it's going to go a long way to keep our",
    "loved ones",
    "who are in a nursing home safe",
    "i will now go to",
    "our chief medical officer of the ohio",
    "department of health",
    "dr bruce vanderhoff doctor thank you for",
    "joining us uh and you're officially on",
    "the team and so thank you very very much",
    "for this uh",
    "the good work that you're doing i know",
    "that you and i've talked an awful lot we",
    "we talked some before you took the",
    "position but uh we've been talking a lot",
    "more",
    "since you took this position so give us",
    "a little perspective from a medical",
    "uh scientific point of view about what",
    "we're seeing",
    "in ohio right now and you know maybe",
    "some of the things that we",
    "should be looking to do and what the",
    "significance of all this is",
    "well thank you thank you governor dewine",
    "i'd like to",
    "share information about really two",
    "things",
    "the science of covid19 and how our",
    "hospitals",
    "are handling all this first let's turn",
    "to the science",
    "at the beginning of march when covid19",
    "first arrived in ohio",
    "we didn't know much about the virus and",
    "the disease it caused",
    "this science has evolved as the virus",
    "has spread across the world",
    "and today our picture of how the disease",
    "progresses",
    "is much more complete",
    "what we know is that this disease is",
    "spread",
    "mostly through the air by respiratory",
    "droplets",
    "when we cough sneeze sing talk",
    "even when we breathe we expel virus",
    "droplets",
    "into the air if an infected person is",
    "having a conversation in close proximity",
    "to another person",
    "or coughs or sneezes next to them",
    "we know now that that second person is",
    "at",
    "real risk of being infected by some of",
    "these airborne droplets",
    "fortunately what we know today",
    "is that there really are simple things",
    "each and every one of us can do to",
    "protect ourselves",
    "from these droplets we can maintain a",
    "good distance say six feet",
    "from those around us and we can wear a",
    "mask",
    "these are simple and yet very effective",
    "non-pharmaceutical interventions that",
    "accomplish three things",
    "they protect the person you're",
    "interacting with",
    "because the mask limits your respiratory",
    "droplet",
    "spray and keeping your distance makes it",
    "harder",
    "to share the virus today we also know",
    "that the masks",
    "protect the wearer from being on the",
    "receiving end",
    "of another person's respiratory droplets",
    "and there's now scientific evidence that",
    "if you're wearing a mask",
    "and yet still or infected you're less",
    "likely to get sick",
    "than if you weren't wearing a mask i",
    "also want to comment",
    "on the importance of good ventilation as",
    "we shift",
    "to being more and more inside we need to",
    "look for ways to ensure good ventilation",
    "when we're around others",
    "so if you're going to be inside around",
    "people who",
    "aren't in your inner circle consider",
    "cracking a window",
    "in addition to wearing a mask the",
    "science",
    "is absolutely clear keeping your",
    "distance",
    "wearing a mask and good ventilation all",
    "work",
    "together to form a protective barrier",
    "against viral transmission it doesn't",
    "matter if you feel fine",
    "or you just have a mild tickle in your",
    "throat",
    "you could be asymptomatic and still a",
    "carrier",
    "be able to infect the people around you",
    "even if you feel absolutely fine",
    "that's why it's crucial that each one of",
    "us",
    "wears a mask when we're around anyone",
    "who",
    "isn't in our immediate circle now as",
    "the holidays approach these protective",
    "measures",
    "are going to be even more important",
    "it's obviously not possible to wear a",
    "mask while you're eating or you're",
    "drinking",
    "which is why we're recommending that you",
    "celebrate",
    "small this season keeping your",
    "celebrations to the inner circle of",
    "people who live in your household",
    "will help protect you and your family",
    "now i'd like to turn to our hospitals",
    "something that's important for us to",
    "know as we",
    "think about and talk about covet 19 is",
    "the trajectory of this disease",
    "and how long it may take for someone to",
    "get sick",
    "sick enough to end up in the hospital",
    "say for example i was infected with",
    "covet 19 on monday it could take",
    "three days for the virus to make me sick",
    "enough",
    "to start showing symptoms then",
    "it could take me another couple days of",
    "feeling lousy",
    "before i decided to go to the doctor",
    "assuming i got",
    "tested and the doctor gave me a result",
    "and that result came back let's say",
    "fairly quickly in 48 hours",
    "it could take another couple of days of",
    "feeling badly before i got sick enough",
    "to say you know i need to go to the",
    "hospital",
    "once people get admitted to the hospital",
    "we need to be aware that",
    "they aren't staying a short period of",
    "time",
    "we've made great strides in the",
    "treatment of combat 19 and those",
    "advancements have in fact reduced",
    "hospital states",
    "a lot nevertheless even with these",
    "improvements",
    "a person who gets admitted to the",
    "hospital for covet 19",
    "typically will stay several days and if",
    "you're sick enough to end up in the icu",
    "especially on a ventilator your length",
    "would stay could be weeks now",
    "if you've never seen anyone who needs a",
    "ventilator for assistance with breathing",
    "you should know that it's not an easy",
    "road",
    "it can take a long time to rebound from",
    "being an event",
    "it's grueling and requires a long",
    "recovery",
    "even after you're breathing on your own",
    "again",
    "i speak directly with my colleagues in",
    "healthcare around the state",
    "each and every day and what they're",
    "telling me is that the situation",
    "is very serious as we look around the",
    "state",
    "every county is being impacted there's",
    "no relief valve",
    "there's no place where the virus isn't",
    "transmitting",
    "at a high rate a month ago we had",
    "a thousand people in the hospital at any",
    "given time",
    "today that number is more than 3 600",
    "and it's growing considerably in the",
    "spring",
    "we focused our efforts on conserving ppe",
    "and building physical capacity the space",
    "and the stuff for our health care system",
    "we were successful and we're in much",
    "better position today",
    "to help support our hospitals through",
    "this surge",
    "however we now face a different kind of",
    "crisis",
    "it's the people it's a staffing",
    "crisis our caregivers are in a",
    "precarious situation",
    "they're at risk of illness because of",
    "their exposure",
    "or their family's exposure outside the",
    "hospital",
    "as a result of these outside the",
    "hospital exposures",
    "some of those people some of those vital",
    "nurses",
    "and other medical staff may be",
    "quarantined",
    "or may become ill themselves many of",
    "them have been treating covet 19",
    "patients",
    "since march and they're just exhausted",
    "let me leave you with this thought",
    "we all need to do absolutely",
    "everything we can to contain the spread",
    "of this virus",
    "we're at a critical juncture we need to",
    "protect",
    "our health care workers i spoke earlier",
    "about the trajectory of the disease",
    "remember that even if we make necessary",
    "changes",
    "immediately it's going to take us weeks",
    "before we start seeing any real",
    "improvement",
    "in those hospital numbers even if you",
    "don't believe",
    "in masks please wear one",
    "keep your distance from other people and",
    "reconsider your gatherings",
    "to protect our health care workers",
    "they really need us now more than ever",
    "doctor thank you very much thanks for",
    "being with us",
    "great to have you on the team department",
    "of mental health and addiction services",
    "director laura",
    "chris is next and we're going to skype",
    "her in",
    "and lori you've talked to me",
    "a lot about uh what we're seeing",
    "out there with people and their mental",
    "health needs",
    "i know that as i've talked to other",
    "people across the state we're seeing",
    "that as well maybe you can",
    "help us a little bit about how to get",
    "through this and maybe help",
    "family and friends get through it yeah",
    "thank you so much governor for having me",
    "back i",
    "appreciate your attention to our",
    "physical health and our mental health as",
    "ohioans and i know that so many others",
    "do as well",
    "this pandemic is definitely creating",
    "prolonged stress for",
    "all of us and if you're feeling stressed",
    "out you're not alone",
    "it's okay to not be okay and it's okay",
    "to ask for help and these are things",
    "that",
    "you've heard me say before you've heard",
    "the governor talk about before",
    "and it's true we've established an ohio",
    "care line",
    "so that if you want to talk to someone",
    "about your stress you can call",
    "1-800-720-9616 to connect with a mental",
    "health professional 24 hours a day",
    "and maybe you don't want to have a",
    "conversation",
    "you'd rather just text with someone",
    "that's available too you can text the",
    "number four",
    "and the word help to 741 741 and you can",
    "chat via text",
    "either way you're connected to a mental",
    "health professional that's just going to",
    "walk you through",
    "answering questions that you have",
    "listening to your concerns connecting",
    "you to resources",
    "or information in your local community",
    "maybe you",
    "don't really need to talk to someone yet",
    "but there are still healthy ways for",
    "each of us to think about",
    "adapting to adversity during the",
    "pandemic and",
    "these are pretty simple things that each",
    "of us can do",
    "but they do take some attention on our",
    "part to make sure that we're",
    "taking care of ourselves so the first",
    "the governor's already talked about this",
    "uh staying emotionally connected to",
    "people that we care about each day",
    "reaching out",
    "to a friend or a family member with a",
    "phone call it helps",
    "us feel better as the person making call",
    "and it's always great to get a phone",
    "call from a friend too",
    "get a little bit of fresh air a little",
    "bit of sunlight a little bit of exercise",
    "each day that gets a little harder in",
    "the colder months in ohio",
    "especially the sunlight sometimes but",
    "getting outside",
    "and even if it's just bundling up and",
    "taking a walk around the block",
    "or doing some stretches inside near a",
    "window these are good things for",
    "us physically and then the other thing",
    "i'll just mention quickly today is",
    "prioritizing time for your spirituality",
    "or your faith",
    "spending some time in meditation or",
    "prayer",
    "is something that can really help with",
    "managing stress too",
    "so again these things sound simple and",
    "it's easy to move away from",
    "anyone or all of these things on a",
    "day-to-day basis especially if we're",
    "dealing with financial struggles",
    "or missing loved ones during the",
    "holidays or",
    "supporting a school-aged child during",
    "the learning from home but",
    "research shows that these coping",
    "strategies will help each of us deal",
    "with adversity",
    "and they help each of us build some",
    "confidence in our skills",
    "calmness in our mind and perseverance",
    "when we're starting to feel the fatigue",
    "of the pandemic",
    "and it taking place over months and",
    "months so remember taking care of",
    "yourself",
    "is a priority not a luxury",
    "and now i just want to take a minute to",
    "talk to our friends and family",
    "and neighbors who have been",
    "struggling with or recovering from a",
    "mental illness or substance use disorder",
    "maybe starting before the pandemic",
    "please keep up with your treatment keep",
    "up with your medication",
    "stay connected to your support groups if",
    "you run a facility that hosts a support",
    "meeting",
    "find ways for that meeting to continue",
    "in person",
    "in a safe way if possible and if not",
    "look for ways",
    "for people to connect virtually through",
    "social media meetings or or other",
    "connections",
    "these support meetings are life-saving",
    "so stay connected to your peers",
    "they'll help you when times get tough",
    "also we know that no matter how long",
    "someone's been in recovery from a mental",
    "illness or a substance use disorder",
    "relapse can happen under prolonged",
    "stress and so the pandemic is certainly",
    "something that can threaten relapse for",
    "our friends and family who are in",
    "recovery let's",
    "make sure that none of us are making",
    "assumptions that we're checking in with",
    "our friends checking in with our",
    "families who we know have struggled with",
    "addiction or mental illness in the past",
    "invite these family members these",
    "friends into our inner circle into our",
    "bubble",
    "to help them find ways to be safe and",
    "help support their wellness from",
    "copen19 but also to reduce opportunities",
    "from being alone and for having a",
    "substance use crisis",
    "without support and and that could",
    "include an overdose",
    "ask your friends and family who are in",
    "recovery if they're okay",
    "encourage them to stay connected to",
    "treatment and support",
    "ask if they need help getting what they",
    "need and if they do",
    "then there's resources available you can",
    "go to takechargeohio.org",
    "or you can again call the ohio care line",
    "at 1-800-720-9616",
    "these are simple ways that each of us",
    "can commit to supporting",
    "ourselves and one another every day",
    "during the pandemic and",
    "and beyond and remember taking care of",
    "yourself is a priority",
    "not a luxury well director thank you",
    "very much um",
    "all good comments very important",
    "comments um",
    "you know for example if someone is in an",
    "aaa group",
    "um what you're saying is try to figure",
    "out",
    "either how to physically continue that",
    "maybe wear masks do something",
    "or do it do it on online or somehow keep",
    "that connection",
    "is that that's right that's right there",
    "are a lot of",
    "peer support groups family support",
    "groups that are continuing in person",
    "maybe there's fewer people they're",
    "sitting further apart they're wearing",
    "masks",
    "the meetings might be shorter so don't",
    "assume that a meeting is not happening",
    "reach out and find out but also",
    "online there are a number of meetings",
    "available",
    "and there are organizations that are",
    "hosting those and and they're private",
    "and confidential",
    "and secure as well great well thank you",
    "very much",
    "thanks for the great work you do and",
    "your team and",
    "folks around the state of ohio so we",
    "appreciate that very very much before we",
    "go to lieutenant governor",
    "maybe just a couple more comments about",
    "the curfew because i'm sure people are",
    "saying what what",
    "all does that mean again ten o'clock to",
    "five to five o'clock in the morning",
    "um basically want people",
    "not to be out but there certainly is",
    "always always exceptions",
    "it would not apply to those who need to",
    "go to work during those hours or those",
    "who need to be out for any kind of",
    "emergency purpose",
    "curfew is not intended to stop anyone",
    "from getting groceries or getting a meal",
    "from carryout",
    "or drive-through or or delivery uh",
    "curfew is not intended to stop anyone",
    "from going to a hospital obviously",
    "or or seeing a doctor or getting help or",
    "treatment for medical or mental health",
    "condition so just kind of common sense",
    "our idea is to kind of carve this time",
    "out and we know that if we all do it",
    "with some exceptions",
    "that that in and of itself will reduce",
    "some of these contacts that are",
    "that are going on so lieutenant governor",
    "we'll turn it over to you",
    "thanks very much governor uh last part",
    "people need to pay attention to that",
    "it's just common sense",
    "and lori and bruce are great a lot of",
    "great advice there",
    "and you know i've had lots of",
    "conversations over the last week from",
    "people who offered",
    "opinions and advice and and and i've",
    "just tried to to put it in perspective",
    "for them",
    "we've heard a lot of statistics it's",
    "always hard to know which ones to use",
    "but",
    "we've had we had it took us five months",
    "to get to our first hundred thousand",
    "cases",
    "and we had a hundred thousand cases of",
    "virus spread over the last three weeks",
    "that puts in perspective about what",
    "we're confronting now and",
    "and i know uh the governor and and uh",
    "bruce alluded to this but over the past",
    "21 days",
    "hospitals as a result of that spread",
    "have seen the increase from",
    "around 1400 patients to over 3 600.",
    "and as a result some of those hospitals",
    "have had to slow",
    "uh have had to accommodate this",
    "increasing numbers by",
    "slowing uh postponing some elective",
    "surgeries and",
    "and we just can't see this trend",
    "continue without it having",
    "a really increasingly negative impact on",
    "the way",
    "that our caregivers provide that care",
    "and so doing nothing",
    "is not an option it's easy to understand",
    "why though because i've had a lot of",
    "these conversations it's easy to",
    "understand why",
    "targeted shutdowns of businesses",
    "like restaurants and phys fitness",
    "centers were were for some considered",
    "pretty unpopular",
    "and they didn't consider it a fair",
    "solution",
    "because those businesses and the people",
    "who rely on those paychecks",
    "would bear a disproportionate",
    "responsibility of the burden",
    "when we know we all know this that the",
    "responsibility for the solution lies",
    "with all of us",
    "personal responsibility and",
    "accountability and shared responsibility",
    "we don't need a shutdown but we do need",
    "to slow down",
    "for a few weeks to get this virus",
    "back into a manageable situation",
    "i often hear people asking for this",
    "balanced approach",
    "as the best approach and our challenge",
    "now is how do we reduce the spread of",
    "the virus",
    "not overwhelm our hospitals keep",
    "businesses open",
    "save jobs educate kids avoid the",
    "unintended consequences",
    "anxiety and stress and mental health",
    "issues",
    "addiction and abuse those things that",
    "lori chris talked about that can wear on",
    "us",
    "this is the complexity of the problem",
    "that we're trying to",
    "resolve and of all of the options we",
    "discussed",
    "with business leaders health care",
    "community leaders",
    "legislators school leaders a 21 day",
    "temporary curfew was considered the",
    "least",
    "disruption of a disruptive option to our",
    "economy",
    "but also believed to have a meaningfully",
    "positive impact for our health care",
    "providers that's the balance",
    "and the majority of the opinions of the",
    "people we talked to",
    "felt the approach the governor outlined",
    "today would be the best",
    "way to go the virus spreads when people",
    "get together",
    "so for a while we need to make sure that",
    "fewer people are coming together",
    "and spreading the virus no shutdowns",
    "just a slowdown this has been hard on",
    "everyone",
    "i've talked to sons and daughters who've",
    "lost parents to covid",
    "overwhelmed nurses who care for coveted",
    "patients and",
    "don't want to carry the virus back home",
    "to their families",
    "i've talked to business owners who've",
    "closed and even more who are struggling",
    "uh and employees who've lost their jobs",
    "and those who are",
    "anxious fearful that they might lose",
    "theirs",
    "and moms who are stressed over educating",
    "their kids at the same time",
    "they're trying to work from home i know",
    "it has been hard and it is hard",
    "but we need to get the spread of this",
    "virus under control and we can do that",
    "uh and we'll get through this",
    "we just do what the governor's asking us",
    "to do we're gonna get through this",
    "to that vaccine that's the light there's",
    "some great news",
    "as the governor mentioned about some",
    "quality vaccine options that are on the",
    "way",
    "we've got to get through this tough part",
    "um",
    "and you know i know it affects every",
    "family",
    "and every family needs to have a plan",
    "and and i shared",
    "with the governor this morning about",
    "what our family our",
    "family plan is um on sunday my dad",
    "called",
    "uh he and my mom are in their 80s",
    "and i know the highlight of their year",
    "is thanksgiving because it's the only",
    "time of the year",
    "where all of their kids and their",
    "grandchildren are ever together",
    "and i knew when i picked up the phone",
    "answering my dad's call he was",
    "he was he was concerned didn't know",
    "how to do it safely so we talked about",
    "it we made a family plan",
    "our families are all going to limit our",
    "exposure between now and thanksgiving",
    "we decided that we would have",
    "thanksgiving outside this year",
    "now i know that can be weather dependent",
    "so we're going to be flexible maybe",
    "it'll be the day before thanksgiving it",
    "might be on thanksgiving it might be the",
    "day after thanksgiving",
    "based on whether the weather will allow",
    "us to well we'll cooperate and allow us",
    "to do that",
    "and we're gonna space everybody out have",
    "every family sit at their individual",
    "table",
    "uh in our in our normal family group but",
    "we're all gonna be together",
    "just a little farther apart than usual i",
    "and we know that this will dramatically",
    "reduce the chance that my mom and dad",
    "will get the virus or be exposed to the",
    "virus",
    "and no it won't be a thanksgiving as",
    "usual",
    "but with the right attitude it will be a",
    "great thanksgiving",
    "and if we do it right if we all do it",
    "right that will",
    "make sure that my mom and dad get to be",
    "around for the next thanksgiving",
    "uh it will be inconvenient but we'll get",
    "through it",
    "we'll all get through this we just",
    "everybody has to have that family plan",
    "and sometimes we have to have those",
    "difficult conversations",
    "like i've had to have with my own family",
    "about how we do this and",
    "i want to say thank you thank you for",
    "all of you who will make sacrifices",
    "have been making them and will be making",

    "you know we're all committed we're going",
    "to do our part help control the spread",
    "coven 19. you know we know there's",
    "tremendous pressure",
    "on the medical system and healthcare",
    "workers it is severe",
    "we know that and all ohioans now have",
    "the chance to kind of step up a little",
    "bit more help curb the spread",
    "and lower the number of patients they're",
    "in our hospitals and the icu",
    "icu units we know those are real numbers",
    "and we know we're all very concerned",
    "about that you know i have two daughters",
    "in the healthcare field",
    "wyodis is a physician assistant here in",
    "columbus",
    "and the other is a registered nurse in",
    "iowa they talk to me all the time about",
    "what they see firsthand",
    "and this virus getting it down in ohio",
    "and getting it down across the united",
    "states",
    "is part of all of our jobs the citizens",
    "so we appreciate",
    "everybody being so focused on this and",
    "we really appreciate your decision",
    "as well as this announcement today we we",
    "think it's the right",
    "step at the right time it's going to",
    "allow ohioans to do their part",
    "without having what we thought would be",
    "an immediate and disastrous impact",
    "on restaurants and thousands of",
    "employees that we shut everything down",
    "the vast majority of restaurants and",
    "hospitality locations",
    "in ohio they are operating safely we",
    "know that",
    "they care so much about their employees",
    "actually refer to them as",
    "their family and we know that we also",
    "love taking care of our guests so we",
    "certainly want to be safe",
    "you know months ago we started something",
    "called the ohio restaurant promise",
    "and that's where operators pledge to",
    "meet and exceed",
    "the dinesafe ohio requirements you know",
    "and we've seen",
    "incredible examples all over the state",
    "restaurants they're separating their",
    "tables they're doing that six-foot",
    "distancing they're placing barriers",
    "between",
    "tables and booths they're doing more",
    "extensive cleaning and sanitizing",
    "and it was already something that was",
    "critical to our industry",
    "you know they make sure that their",
    "employees are wearing their get in their",
    "mask and the guests are wearing mask",
    "until they sit down to eat and i haven't",
    "saw over the last couple weeks",
    "installation of new air filtration",
    "updated air filtration systems and units",
    "and restaurants all over the place it's",
    "just a great",
    "great thing that we're seeing we're",
    "really proud of the work that's being",
    "done by restaurants",
    "food service locations and many bars you",
    "know",
    "even though many of them are facing",
    "sales that have been down between",
    "20 and 70 percent versus the same time",
    "a year ago and any of you that are in",
    "business know how difficult it is to",
    "operate",
    "that way at the same time they have all",
    "these ppe costs they're",
    "very significant you know i think it's",
    "important to recognize that restaurants",
    "have done",
    "everything to ensure that they're not",
    "spreading the virus",
    "and the good news is that metal experts",
    "medical experts",
    "confirm it's true the spread appears to",
    "be occurring",
    "in unregulated settings like we've",
    "talked about home parties",
    "family gatherings social events some",
    "schools and other places where",
    "individuals",
    "are not always following the advice and",
    "wearing mask as our as our doctor talked",
    "about",
    "we believe the curfew is the best choice",
    "to slow",
    "things down right now and help everybody",
    "understand it's time to be",
    "even more cautious i think it's a good",
    "decision",
    "most restaurants especially independent",
    "and family-owned ones",
    "can't survive the pandemic without all",
    "of us doing our part to control",
    "this virus you know many restaurants and",
    "small businesses all over",
    "ohio were able to take part of the",
    "paycheck protection program",
    "which was a lifeline that was funding",
    "that we got a few months ago",
    "but that money's gone now more recently",
    "governor you and lieutenant governor",
    "provided several forms of financial",
    "support including the bwc refund and",
    "we're so thankful",
    "for that those are all steps to help",
    "businesses get through this in employees",
    "however we all know it's not enough you",
    "know restaurants",
    "and food service and retail businesses",
    "they need to remain open you know we're",
    "providing food to guests at restaurants",
    "but you know that we're really stepping",
    "up and doing more and more carryout",
    "in pickup window in delivery and this is",
    "going to help ensure that",
    "as many of those 585 000 people who call",
    "our industry their home",
    "that's where they work keep their jobs",
    "you know we're really",
    "also thankful for our ability to",
    "continue offering takeout and delivery",
    "past",
    "uh 10 o'clock you know we feed ohioans",
    "we take care of thousands of essential",
    "employees who work those second and",
    "third shifts",
    "as well as everybody on the front line",
    "who's working 24 hours a day",
    "you know we take this responsibility",
    "seriously and we pledge to continue",
    "operating safely",
    "and continue to work with you thank you",
    "john thank you very much appreciate it",
    "a number of your members have contacted",
    "me about their what they're doing",
    "uh with their air filtration and uh",
    "some very very uh you know really",
    "following the science on that",
    "and that's uh that's very important we",
    "we appreciate that very much",
    "thank you thanks for being with us",
    "ready to go to questions governor your",
    "first question today is from laura",
    "hancock at cleveland.com",
    "good afternoon governor",
    "on monday the fbi searched the home of",
    "the puco chairman",
    "samandazo an indication that he could be",
    "under a federal investigation",
    "you appointed him are you continue are",
    "you comfortable with him continuing to",
    "serve in that position",
    "have you discussed the situation with",
    "him",
    "i've not discussed it with him um you",
    "know we have no indication he's",
    "under investigation or he's a target of",
    "an investigation",
    "uh you know we'll we'll wait until we",
    "find additional",
    "facts but we don't we don't have any",
    "indication of that at this point",
    "next question is from tom jackson at the",
    "sandusky register",
    "tom",
    "consider uh actually closing",
    "restaurants and bars on thursday like",
    "you had previously talked about",
    "and also does are are people going to be",
    "allowed to do",
    "carryout after 10 or does everything",
    "shut down well tom i missed the first",
    "part i think i got the question",
    "i'll try to answer it if i didn't answer",
    "it you come back and tell me i didn't",
    "answer it but",
    "as as far as the carryout yes carryout",
    "will",
    "will be allowed nothing",
    "no retail no place you can walk in",
    "retail uh but you could do it you could",
    "do a drive-through",
    "if a restaurant had drive-through you",
    "could do",
    "if they have delivery you can do the",
    "delivery and get a",
    "pizza delivered whatever you want to",
    "have delivered so and i sort of missed",
    "the first part of the question",
    "i think",
    "governor the first part of the question",
    "is have you now",
    "ruled out closing bars and restaurants",
    "because previously there was an",
    "announcement you were going to discuss",
    "that thursday",
    "yeah we looked at this and frankly we",
    "heard from you know a lot of people who",
    "work at",
    "bars and restaurants and uh you know",
    "i've always said we do we do listen",
    "i got some amazingly compelling",
    "uh emails um in regard to this some",
    "texts",
    "and you know behind each worker there's",
    "a story",
    "you know there's a single mom out there",
    "who who's this is what she's doing",
    "trying to keep her family moving forward",
    "we got people with other",
    "other situations so you know every",
    "employee has a story",
    "every owner has a story as as well",
    "so what we tried to do is balance things",
    "but we have to take action and so we're",
    "going to try this we're going to do this",
    "for",
    "for three weeks uh we think that we",
    "could accomplish frankly a lot more by",
    "having this curfew than we could",
    "at closing one or two different",
    "business sectors uh and so we're going",
    "to try this for for 21 days",
    "uh this coupled with uh the mass",
    "worrying enforcement in retail",
    "which we're already starting to see some",
    "results it looks like people are",
    "more and more people are wearing masks",
    "that along with our",
    "request today for everyone not only with",
    "the curfew",
    "but to do one two three other things in",
    "a day",
    "to reduce the number of contacts that",
    "you have",
    "with somebody else and then we're in the",
    "mass so if we could all do these things",
    "we will avoid shutdowns but",
    "no one can predict the future i do",
    "feel very strongly that we have it",
    "within our power",
    "to keep our kids in school to keep those",
    "in nursing homes safe and as well",
    "as keeping our hospitals from being",
    "over run and not being able to serve us",
    "so we have it within our power to do",
    "that we think we have a formula here to",
    "do it to start knocking this",
    "knocking the curve down again and we're",
    "going to try it",
    "next question is from farnoosh amiri at",
    "the associated press",
    "hi governor um thanks a lot for taking",
    "the time today",
    "i do want to go back and clarify because",
    "i think",
    "you mentioned something about people",
    "still being allowed to go",
    "get groceries after 10 p.m and i guess",
    "i'm a little confused on",
    "how that would work if all retail i",
    "don't think look i don't think grocery",
    "stores open",
    "beyond 10 o'clock but if people are",
    "going in there it's probably not a high",
    "risk there's probably not that many",
    "people in there",
    "so we're not going to say you can't get",
    "groceries and we're not going to say you",
    "can't go to a pharmacy now",
    "whether it's a pharmacy open beyond 10",
    "o'clock there may be some",
    "but we're not going to tell them that",
    "they have to close someone may need",
    "a drug someone may have some reason that",
    "they",
    "have to be at a at a grocery store so",
    "you know this is this is we want",
    "basically we want everybody home by 10",
    "o'clock but there are",
    "there's always emergencies and there's",
    "always there's always some exceptions",
    "but all retail",
    "closed by 10 o'clock you can do carryout",
    "you can do delivery but all all of the",
    "retail",
    "basically that you walk into is in fact",
    "closed that should accomplish",
    "putting people at home you know but",
    "there are a couple exceptions that you",
    "know",
    "we think make sense",
    "next question is from andy chow at ohio",
    "public radio and television",
    "andy hey governor uh so you just",
    "detailed",
    "how this order impacts businesses and",
    "how restaurants can stay open for",
    "delivery and pick up how does this order",
    "impact just everyday people like you",
    "said you want people you're hoping that",
    "after 10 pm people go home",
    "how will the health order be written is",
    "it like a stay-at-home order for from 10",
    "p.m to 5 a.m",
    "well it's gonna be similar i mean we're",
    "calling it a curfew we think",
    "curfew probably describes it at best uh",
    "i mean this was reported",
    "um you know i saw some headlines uh this",
    "morning and",
    "some stories yesterday that talked about",
    "a business curfew it's really not a",
    "business curfew it's curfew",
    "uh the goal is to have fewer",
    "contacts if we can take these contacts",
    "with people have with other people down",
    "20 30",
    "we saw the impact it had in the spring",
    "we're not shutting businesses down",
    "but remember in the spring we had a lot",
    "of businesses open anyway some were",
    "closed",
    "we went to the essential non-essential",
    "but the whole idea is if you can",
    "slow these contacts down um",
    "that's going to be go a long way to slow",
    "this virus down this virus lives",
    "only when it goes from one person to the",
    "other and so",
    "if you reduce those number of contacts",
    "that's why i",
    "ask people in addition to the curfew do",
    "something every day",
    "think what am i going to do what would i",
    "normally do i'm getting ready to do is",
    "no i don't want to do that because that",
    "will uh you know",
    "increase the contacts and so if you just",
    "decrease the contacts we're going to be",
    "better off the curfew starts us down",
    "that path",
    "i'm asking people to do more than the",
    "curfew and we believe that those things",
    "coming together along with",
    "the mask worrying and in retail we hope",
    "mask worrying",
    "throughout uh we'll start flattening",
    "this curve and start getting this thing",
    "under control",
    "next question is from jeff redick at",
    "wsyx in columbus",
    "afternoon governor jeff does this uh",
    "strengthen the 10 person gathering limit",
    "in other words that's not often enforced",
    "would it be more enforced under the",
    "curfew",
    "secondly science behind this yeah look i",
    "mean we don't anticipate for example",
    "uh someone's driving down down the the",
    "road on",
    "you know 71 or 70 or wherever",
    "uh you know and it's past 10 o'clock",
    "we're not really",
    "anticipating they're going to get pulled",
    "over unless they're doing something else",
    "but let's say there's somebody uh",
    "there's there's a group of people coming",
    "together",
    "and it's 10 30 and they're in a park or",
    "they're someplace",
    "there's someplace else well it would be",
    "logical for police to go over there and",
    "say hey what's going on",
    "um and so that does not depend on the 10",
    "person order",
    "is a curfew and the curfew is what you",
    "know really would control",
    "uh if you look at the 10 person order we",
    "reissued it",
    "and the real change substantive change",
    "in there is we are very specific",
    "uh in regard to banquets very specific",
    "in regard to weddings funerals",
    "these gatherings after the funeral after",
    "the wedding",
    "where people naturally want to get",
    "together and that's fine",
    "but they need to wear masks they need to",
    "be careful they need to be",
    "seated and so that was not in the",
    "previous orders that",
    "is now in in the orders next question is",
    "from kevin landers at wbns",
    "in columbus well governor thanks again",
    "for doing this uh you are going to be",
    "criticized for not being tough enough at",
    "a time when cases",
    "are going up if we shut down for 21 days",
    "wouldn't that have a more",
    "dramatic decrease or impact in",
    "eliminating",
    "these cases from going up what was your",
    "driving",
    "decision as to why you didn't feel",
    "strong enough to do",
    "a shutdown well a shutdown is is rather",
    "dramatic we did it once",
    "uh doing it the second time has you know",
    "uh",
    "double the ramifications quite candidly",
    "some people survived the first shutdown",
    "won't survive the second shutdown if",
    "it's a relatively short period of time",
    "there are all the other consequences",
    "lord chris talked about the consequences",
    "that we have seen",
    "in regard to mental health you know you",
    "do a shutdown",
    "that you increase the mental health",
    "problems",
    "you would be saying if you did a",
    "complete shutdown nobody goes to school",
    "and yet we know that um there",
    "are kids who are doing well in school",
    "that don't do well outside of school",
    "and each school is making that",
    "determination we would then be",
    "overriding that",
    "and telling every school they have to",
    "close they have to they have to go",
    "remote all kinds of cons",
    "all kinds of consequences um you know we",
    "saw",
    "uh when we looked at overdoses deaths uh",
    "in the spring they went up",
    "goes back to something that lori was was",
    "talking about director chris was talking",
    "about",
    "um you know people being together and we",
    "think",
    "one of the reasons those overdoses went",
    "up is frankly people",
    "took drugs they overdosed no one was",
    "there to call 9-1-1",
    "so for everything we do",
    "that distorts the economy or or changes",
    "things there are consequences and there",
    "are many times they're unintended",
    "consequences",
    "so what i had to do is balance that you",
    "know",
    "the bad things that could happen with",
    "what would be the positive things",
    "that would happen uh came up with this",
    "idea",
    "uh that a curfew could carve into that",
    "time",
    "uh cut the contacts down",
    "but the success of this also not only",
    "depends on people",
    "following the curfew but also people",
    "wearing masks",
    "and seeing that mask compliance go up in",
    "some",
    "counties from 20 we need to get to 90 95",
    "percent in stores",
    "we expect to see that and it's also from",
    "everyone",
    "pitching in and saying hey we can do",
    "this so we've set a goal",
    "we got 21 21 days we need to knock this",
    "thing down we need to start seeing cases",
    "go down",
    "because even at the rate we are now and",
    "we've not seen them",
    "go up for the last two or three days now",
    "it's over the weekend so you always get",
    "kind of",
    "skewed numbers but even at this high",
    "number if it never goes up",
    "anymore it's not acceptable these high",
    "numbers that we are out for 7",
    "7 500 8 000 cases a day are going to",
    "mean a lot more deaths and a lot more",
    "people in icu and a lot more people in",
    "the hospital",
    "a lot more schools closed a lot more",
    "virus get into our nursing homes",
    "and our hospitals be really hit so",
    "um i'm counting on the people of ohio",
    "we've got 21 days let's do it let's",
    "start today",
    "let's do what we need to do and we'll",
    "evaluate it after 21 days",
    "no responsible governor would ever say",
    "i'm not never going to do this",
    "i'm never going to do that this is our",
    "attempt not to do those things",
    "it's our attempt to pull everybody",
    "together on one team",
    "not single out any particular industry",
    "but say hey we're all in this together",
    "we gotta knock this thing down let's",
    "let's sprint let's do it for 21 days",
    "let's see where we are and we'll",
    "evaluate it after 21 days",
    "governor um just wanted to",
    "add a couple things to the or to answer",
    "the question",
    "just to try to simplify this for folks",
    "is that if 10 pm comes around you got to",
    "go to work then you can go to work",
    "if you got an emergency you can go take",
    "care of it",
    "but otherwise go home and try to help us",
    "achieve the goal",
    "of reducing people who are not normally",
    "in the same household from coming",
    "together",
    "when we had these long discussions over",
    "the past week the hospital officials say",
    "look that's the goal",
    "everything that contributes to people",
    "coming together is the cause",
    "and everything that we can do to prevent",
    "people from coming together is the",
    "solution",
    "and we tested this idea of the curfew",
    "with",
    "with the business community and the",
    "hospital community",
    "the health community and they all",
    "thought this was a",
    "was a reasonable compromise to get there",
    "uh",
    "to find that balance and if people",
    "follow it it will work",
    "uh it will definitely work to help slow",
    "the number of contacts",
    "and get us uh to the point where we're",
    "going to be able to",
    "get this in a manageable situation again",
    "and as far as closing more down",
    "i mean we always have to remember this",
    "is a balance so the governor and i have",
    "done",
    "i don't know governor probably close to",
    "calls with 30 counties and",
    "superintendents and",
    "hospitals and local government officials",
    "and and",
    "when you do these calls you get the",
    "practical",
    "feel for the interconnectedness of how",
    "everything is in our society that when",
    "schools are closed",
    "nurses who work in hospitals don't have",
    "anybody to take care of their children",
    "how all of these things are connected",
    "and how keeping things open",
    "and doing it right benefits everyone",
    "from an economic and health point of",
    "view but we just have to own it",
    "we have to own doing this right",
    "so that we can knock this virus down get",
    "through this",
    "difficult period so that we can get to",
    "the vaccine and",
    "and to kevin's question we can do this",
    "this is this is a good compromise",
    "between all of those competing interests",
    "next question is from jesse ballmert at",
    "the cincinnati enquirer",
    "hi governor jesse my question",
    "is uh what evidence or experts do we",
    "consult",
    "to uh decide on the ten to five",
    "number um and how that will make enough",
    "effect on the numbers and then the",
    "second quick question is what penalties",
    "are there for not complying with the",
    "curfew",
    "yeah we look we know we know the basic",
    "science",
    "um and we had um the doctors who we",
    "normally consult",
    "uh take a look at this and the the basic",
    "science is fewer contacts",
    "fewer spread less spread",
    "so anytime that you can reduce contacts",
    "you know statistically you will reduce",
    "spread",
    "particularly when you have in some",
    "counties",
    "today when you look at the number of",
    "cases that they've",
    "they have and you look at it and you say",
    "it's one out of 100 people in the last",
    "two weeks",
    "have come down with the virus in this",
    "county that",
    "tells you how dangerous it is out there",
    "so whenever you can reduce that contact",
    "it matters and that's you know this is",
    "one way of doing it there's",
    "it's not the only way of doing it we",
    "could have done it other ways but",
    "it seemed to me to make sense and we ran",
    "it by a lot of different people and",
    "scientists and who",
    "thought yeah that that makes sense but",
    "look nothing is perfect",
    "nothing is guaranteed this is all",
    "depends on how you know how well",
    "we we do this thank you",
    "next question is from laura bischoff at",
    "the dayton daily news",
    "hey laura hey governor i wanted to",
    "circle back to laura hancock's question",
    "about sam randazzo you said there's no",
    "indication that he's the target of an",
    "investigation",
    "why don't you consider an fbi predawn",
    "search warrant where they carry out box",
    "loads of stuff",
    "not an indication of an investigation i",
    "mean you're a former prosecutor you",
    "oversaw bci",
    "tell us when these kinds of searches are",
    "just friendly visits",
    "look look the the fbi many times will",
    "indicate that someone's a target they've",
    "not indicated that he's a target",
    "i have no reason to think he's a target",
    "i don't know",
    "um so you know we're",
    "waiting for additional information quite",
    "candidly",
    "um you know we uh i hired him",
    "uh i think he's a good person uh if",
    "there's evidence to the contrary then",
    "we'll we'll act accordingly but yeah",
    "not going to act without that without",
    "facts",
    "next question is from jim province of",
    "the toledo blade",
    "governor thanks again for taking our",
    "questions um",
    "why did you settle on three weeks i mean",
    "do you anticipate that uh",
    "we would have to extend the curfew",
    "beyond that do",
    "would we have enough evidence as to",
    "whether it's working after three weeks",
    "and do you know whether this has been",
    "tried in other states and what the",
    "success rate has been",
    "yeah i've seen that some states have",
    "have looked at curfew i don't know",
    "though",
    "we've got empirical data uh",
    "you know what has happened when others",
    "have used it it has been used in europe",
    "uh the situation in europe is different",
    "uh",
    "because in europe uh what they've been",
    "able to do",
    "when they put an earlier curfew you know",
    "earlier",
    "you could do a 60 o'clock or seven or",
    "eight o'clock",
    "when they've been able to do that",
    "clearly they've knocked businesses out",
    "and knocked a lot of employees out",
    "and they subsidize those those",
    "individuals we do not have the ability",
    "in ohio sadly to to to do that",
    "we've looked at it we've looked at all",
    "kinds of options can we subsidize people",
    "uh and you know the federal government",
    "came through us a very significant money",
    "but that money is now gone",
    "and we don't have the ability to look at",
    "that as an option",
    "so in answer to your question we know",
    "it's been used in europe",
    "uh it's been but it's used been used",
    "differently than we would be using it",
    "here",
    "because we don't have a we don't have",
    "any money and therefore we can't extend",
    "those",
    "extend those hours 21 days there's",
    "nothing magical about 21 days",
    "uh you know we instituted some things",
    "last week that we thought will",
    "make a difference we're instituting the",
    "curfew now",
    "uh we're asking ohioans do very very",
    "specific things or refrain from doing",
    "specific things there's",
    "much more awareness today in ohio about",
    "what the",
    "problem is as people are seeing these",
    "numbers go up as they're starting now to",
    "hear from their local hospital officials",
    "so",
    "uh 21 days is an eternity",
    "with this virus so where we are in 21",
    "days",
    "i don't know i hope we're in a better",
    "position than we are",
    "today but it seemed like 21 days was",
    "let's give this a run for 21 days",
    "we may have to take much more drastic",
    "action we don't know",
    "we may have to we may be able to get rid",
    "of the curfew we may keep the curfew",
    "you know we're gonna have to judge this",
    "um you know",
    "at that time but this is long enough",
    "until we can see you know get some",
    "patterns and it's long enough to see",
    "what what is going on and what the",
    "result there is of doing this",
    "next question is from james pilcher at",
    "wkrc in cincinnati",
    "good afternoon governor i wanted to",
    "circle back and get specifics on",
    "enforcement penalties",
    "who who enforces this what are the",
    "penalties",
    "and as an adjunct question i saw a post",
    "today from an elected mayor in this",
    "in the state saying don't listen to the",
    "tyranny",
    "have as big a thanksgiving as you want",
    "what do you say to somebody like that i",
    "know the two different",
    "ones more of a logistical question yeah",
    "well",
    "look i just i think we're at the point",
    "of this debate in this discussion after",
    "eight months",
    "that um you know the science is clear",
    "as a former colleague of mine daniel",
    "patrick moynihan once said",
    "everyone's entitled to their own opinion",
    "you're just not entitled to your own",
    "facts",
    "and i would say that to that mayor uh",
    "and to other people who are just totally",
    "irresponsible",
    "uh and want to be telling people to do",
    "things that may end up",
    "hurting them or killing them so i just i",
    "find that to be",
    "totally totally outrageous can you just",
    "follow up on the uh",
    "on the penalties and the enforcement is",
    "it going to be up to law enforcement to",
    "enforce this and",
    "and what can they arrest somebody can",
    "they give what are they getting tickets",
    "what are the what are the penalties here",
    "yeah let me get uh i'm going to have my",
    "my team",
    "send in to me the statute or the or the",
    "reference point",
    "in here and i'll get back i'll answer",
    "that in in a minute but basically we're",
    "having",
    "calls now uh our team is with with",
    "with local law enforcement um and",
    "again we do not expect",
    "law enforcement to go pull people over",
    "because they're out beyond 10 o'clock",
    "but if they're seeing some something",
    "going on",
    "um this isn't this this is a way that",
    "law enforcement can walk up to them and",
    "say hey guys",
    "you know you're you're here you're",
    "hanging out at this gas station or",
    "you're here or there you're congregating",
    "together and there is a curfew",
    "and why don't you just go home uh you",
    "know we're not looking for a heavy hand",
    "here",
    "and we don't want to put law enforcement",
    "in a difficult position",
    "on the other hand uh this is it is it is",
    "a serious matter and we need to",
    "we need to deal with it so i'll get back",
    "i'll answer that as soon as i",
    "get something from our team here so",
    "thank you",
    "next question is from josh ruttenberg at",
    "spectrum news",
    "hi governor hi josh question for you",
    "you've used words in this very press",
    "conference like dramatic to paint the",
    "picture of the virus",
    "and common sense as far as what",
    "certain measures need to be taken um and",
    "the lieutenant governor said that this",
    "was the least disruptive option in the",
    "economy",
    "um but do you have data to suggest that",
    "the majority of people are out between",
    "10 pm and 5 a.m as opposed to 5 a.m to",
    "10 p.m",
    "and if and if not why is this not being",
    "done in reverse",
    "you know josh excellent question uh",
    "right now",
    "i can guarantee you there there are some",
    "people who are tweeting",
    "uh and who are saying that uh dewine is",
    "a dictator and a tyrant",
    "and uh in doing this so you know we got",
    "different points of view",
    "but we wanted to see what could be least",
    "disruptive that would not cause",
    "other problems other social problems",
    "unemployment more mental health problems",
    "but could make a significant difference",
    "and no of course there's more people out",
    "during the day than there is between 10",
    "o'clock",
    "and and and 5 and 5 a.m but there are",
    "people out at 10 o'clock",
    "and the goal is you know we we put",
    "a stop of alcohol some months ago at 10",
    "o'clock",
    "in in our bars okay",
    "then then the uh you know people said",
    "well they're congregating here they're",
    "congregating there they're doing this",
    "okay this should eliminate most of that",
    "additional congregating uh and that",
    "contact that occurs after 10 o'clock and",
    "so while",
    "there may not be as many people out",
    "after 10 o'clock",
    "um you know with the exception of those",
    "who are working and doing",
    "other things you know many many of them",
    "are out congregating together",
    "and so this should get rid of most of",
    "that",
    "uh nothing's perfect and this",
    "coupled with what we did last week on",
    "with retail establishments",
    "where we're saying you you know you",
    "unless you've got",
    "a medical reason and we resp and by the",
    "way we respect those medical reasons and",
    "somebody doesn't have a mass we should",
    "not",
    "no one should give them a hard time",
    "let's just assume that they've got",
    "a medical reason but you couple those",
    "things that we've done in the in the",
    "last",
    "um six days and",
    "we think you know it gives us a shot at",
    "this thing",
    "a good shot at it's slowing this down",
    "now we know it's not easy",
    "uh when you get spread as high as seven",
    "thousand new thousand",
    "cases a day seven new cases a day seven",
    "thousand new case a day",
    "i mean you you know it's it's hard to",
    "slow this down",
    "the faster this train goes uh and it's",
    "going pretty fast now the harder it is",
    "to slow it down",
    "but we think we have a shot at doing it",
    "without causing",
    "many other social problems uh that",
    "also are very very bad so i've said this",
    "before",
    "but most of what i'm doing and the",
    "choices i'm making are between two bad",
    "decisions",
    "which one's worse because one's least",
    "worse",
    "so lieutenant governor yes thank you",
    "governor uh",
    "you you you hit the you hit the right",
    "point right there is that",
    "is that over the last week we have i",
    "mean look we've been doing this for nine",
    "months but over the last week",
    "we really uh we really pursued",
    "all of the available options and we",
    "talked to medical officials and people",
    "that were talking about the strain of",
    "the economy and the mental health issues",
    "and",
    "because it's not covid's not the only",
    "problem of the pandemic",
    "coven is the cause of the pandemic but",
    "it creates other problems economic ones",
    "mental health ones",
    "and and this i i know",
    "i'm convinced from the conversations",
    "i've had over the last week",
    "that this is a balanced approach this is",
    "a middle ground",
    "this will slow down enough the people",
    "that are coming together",
    "that we can impact the spread of the",
    "virus",
    "move it back to the point where it can",
    "be controlled",
    "and at the same time not cause",
    "a catastrophic effect in the economy and",
    "you have to care about both you",
    "can't just care about one in isolation",
    "you have to find a balance",
    "that's what the governor tasked all of",
    "us to do is to",
    "to to help with that challenge and",
    "and based on all of the recommendations",
    "this was the most impactful uh with the",
    "least disruption that we could",
    "determine that we could come up with",
    "next question is from scott hallis of",
    "the xenia daily gazette",
    "hi scott hey governor how are you i'm",
    "wilson",
    "good um a lot of school or not a lot but",
    "there are many schools in the dayton",
    "area who are starting to go back to",
    "remote learning for the next couple",
    "weeks or even",
    "longer because of some outbreaks within",
    "their",
    "district um that leads to a few",
    "questions i've received from some",
    "from some folks regarding winter sports",

    "occur to make it safe",
    "they'll be you know significantly less",
    "in attendance because we're going to be",
    "inside",
    "versus what it would have been outside",
    "with a football game but there are fewer",
    "participants we're in a football team",
    "you might have 50 60 players",
    "with some of the the basketball and",
    "others you you have maybe",

    "we are in constant communication with",

    "of 3701.352 this is a general health",
    "order",
    "it's like any any other order i believe",
    "second-degree misdemeanor",
    "not more than 750 fine 90 days in jail i",
    "would just",
    "point out that to my knowledge we have",
    "no one has been charged under",
    "under these health orders doesn't mean",
    "there couldn't be but they have not been",
    "so far",
    "next question is from lucia wallinches",
    "at oh i",
    "on ohio good afternoon governor and",
    "thank you so much for taking my call",
    "um we'll be talking a lot about you know",
    "making sure that people stay",
    "safe and stay away from each other so",
    "that we don't overwhelm hospitals",
    "last week the ohio court of claims ruled",
    "that the number of",
    "beds available and you know ppe and",
    "ventilators and so forth",
    "should be released to the public so i",
    "just wanted to inquire if you had any",
    "plans um",
    "you know when and how to release that",
    "are you going to add that to the",
    "dashboard is there a certain time you're",
    "going to release that every",
    "day there's no reason we can't release",
    "that",
    "i'm aware of and i'm not sure exactly",
    "how we're going to release it but we",
    "will",
    "we'll should be able to get that out",
    "great thank you",
    "this is all data that you know we're",
    "pulling we're getting uh that's been",
    "reporting to us",
    "from from the hospitals around the state",
    "great thank you next question is from",
    "randy ludlow at the columbus dispatch",
    "hey randy",
    "good afternoon governor uh we're still a",
    "little unclear on the retail component",
    "of this",
    "uh you said retail businesses will",
    "generally be",
    "required to close what are the",
    "exemptions",
    "who can remain open and uh is dine-in",
    "permitted at restaurants past thursday",
    "no randy uh we'll have this in the order",
    "uh it's not out yet but you'll you'll",
    "see it but",
    "basically it is",
    "perfume people should be home by 10",
    "o'clock",
    "there are exceptions exceptions if you",
    "know there's some emergency some reason",
    "they need to be out and they're common",
    "they're basically common sense",
    "exceptions as far as retail",
    "um you know we're never going to close a",
    "pharmacy",
    "i'm not going to close grocery store",
    "because they have",
    "things that some people need it late at",
    "night that someone in sick",
    "we're not going to close those as far as",
    "food no dine in",
    "nothing open but there could be delivery",
    "of pizza for example",
    "there could be a drive-through",
    "order and pick something up right there",
    "so you know those things",
    "would be would be permitted uh but",
    "any any retail you walk into uh",
    "basically",
    "uh with the exception as i said of the",
    "grocery store and the pharmacy",
    "uh would be closed at ten o'clock and so",
    "it has the ability to really kind of",
    "push people more towards home and uh",
    "slow things down for for that period of",
    "time",
    "i'm sorry we'll dine in be still be",
    "permitted at restaurants past thursday",
    "no no dine in no dine in beyond 10",
    "beyond 10 o'clock i'm asking about",
    "during the day you had talked to closing",
    "restaurants",
    "apparently you're not going to do that",
    "dining will be permitted prior to 10 p.m",
    "yeah sure and look we we we encourage",
    "uh the restaurants have worked hard on",
    "this",
    "and you know there are a few outliers",
    "uh but you know they come under uh",
    "you know they need to have people with",
    "mask and do everything they need to do",
    "but the vast vast majority of",
    "restaurants are doing what we have asked",
    "them",
    "to do and are working very very hard at",
    "that",
    "you know look we encouraged uh",
    "carryout i think carryout is one way we",
    "can support our restaurants",
    "and it's a good thing next question is",
    "from desiree gosselin at wkbn in",
    "youngstown",
    "hi yes thank you um just to clarify on",
    "the last",
    "call bar rule um is that still in effect",
    "or",
    "do people need to be out of the door",
    "before tonight",
    "yeah every retail establishment will",
    "close at 10 o'clock",
    "next question is from jack windsor at",
    "wmfd",
    "in mansfield hey jack",
    "hi governor uh last week your medical",
    "experts told us that they see",
    "mass compliance being high and that",
    "shutdowns would do more harm than good",
    "and then back on july 15th cases were",
    "already dropping when you said quote if",
    "all of us put on a face covering for",
    "four weeks",
    "six weeks we would drive this epidemic",
    "into the ground",
    "now here we are 16 weeks later and in",
    "light of that last week the new england",
    "journal of medicine",
    "military study indicated that cases were",
    "actually higher and those who",
    "quarantined and underwent strict",
    "enforcement of masking distancing and",
    "disinfecting",
    "so it appears that the masking",
    "distancing and quarantining",
    "isn't stopping the spread but we do know",
    "that it's certainly creating unintended",
    "consequences",
    "that are hurting many people but it also",
    "appears that you're not willing to come",
    "off a dime",
    "and consider different directions so my",
    "question is why",
    "well i'm going to refer to our doctors",
    "dr still on",
    "i am indeed yeah all right bruce you",
    "want to answer that",
    "to jack you know i would caution uh",
    "anyone",
    "looking at a particular study and using",
    "it as a basis for",
    "um contradicting a vast repository of",
    "medical",
    "data and information it is",
    "incontrovertible",
    "that masking is effective in reducing",
    "the transmission of this virus",
    "it is incontrovertible that staying",
    "apart from one another reduces the",
    "spread of this and it defies common",
    "sense",
    "if one understands the very good science",
    "around the droplet",
    "nature of this virus and its droplet",
    "spread",
    "if one looks at the pattern of",
    "transmission across large populations",
    "it is absolutely evident that this is a",
    "respiratory virus",
    "respiratory virus not unlike the flu and",
    "that we need to do the",
    "simple common sense things our mothers",
    "taught us when we were young",
    "to avoid getting cold and flu we just",
    "have to do it in a much more serious way",
    "with this one because",
    "it is more transmissible and there is",
    "recent research showing that it has",
    "evolved to be",
    "highly contagious and i i think that's",
    "that's the story thank you",
    "next question is from adrian robbins at",
    "wcmh",
    "in columbus hi governor thank you so",
    "much for taking my question",
    "um dr vanderhoff said that",
    "we see hospitalizations as kind of a",
    "lagging indicator",
    "from what the hospitals are telling you",
    "do we have 21 more days",
    "if the curfew isn't as effective as we",
    "need it to be",
    "when it comes to how quickly our",
    "hospitals are are filling up",
    "well i'll let the doctor answer that one",
    "as well i just i'll start",
    "by saying look our goal is to set this",
    "out",
    "for 21 days if hospitals come to me at",
    "any time",
    "and say uh you know we have a bigger",
    "we have an emergency you must take",
    "additional action we're gonna",
    "you know we're gonna listen i mean it's",
    "all based on facts that are coming in",
    "uh so uh you know we make these",
    "decisions every day we've set this",
    "out we think that uh we can let this run",
    "for 21 days",
    "uh and if particularly uh",
    "if ohioans you know really",
    "uh get the percentage of mass worrying",
    "i'll go back to what jack said i",
    "disagree with what jack said we have",
    "some communities where",
    "mass warrants 20 percent in some",
    "establishments but it's going up now",
    "and that's that's the good thing bruce",
    "yeah i think it's a i think it's a very",
    "good question and",
    "uh what i i hope um people",
    "are beginning to to gather is",
    "just what you're pointing to that this",
    "is a ship that won't turn around quickly",
    "but",
    "we should be able to see a real impact",
    "from the guidance the steps that have",
    "been",
    "advised and taken over the last week or",
    "so the masking",
    "the asking people to stay apart and now",
    "this curfew in about two weeks so a two",
    "to three week interval",
    "to look and see look for an impact",
    "is just about the right amount of time",
    "it's a reasonable window of time",
    "to look for that impact and look",
    "specifically for it on our hospitals",
    "next question is from ian cross at wews",
    "in cleveland hi good afternoon thank you",
    "governor",
    "i have a two-part question um what",
    "guarantees can you provide to assure the",
    "small business community that compliance",
    "enforcement will be applied",
    "evenly and fairly uh regardless of if it",
    "is a",
    "fortune 500 company or a small",
    "family-run business",
    "and secondly do large retailers with",
    "significantly more resources and",
    "customers at any given time",
    "have a great responsibility to go beyond",
    "the health order that went into effect",
    "on monday",
    "yeah give me the give me the second",
    "question again sure um",
    "large retailers you know with with more",
    "resources and more customers do you",
    "think that they have",
    "um a greater responsibility to go beyond",
    "what the health order monday",
    "entailed",
    "well the health order is pretty explicit",
    "you know i think many companies",
    "certainly are already doing",
    "some of this but i've had some",
    "conversations with some of the bigger",
    "ones directly so yeah",
    "i think they will um but you know what",
    "we what we",
    "want to see is substantial mass",
    "compliance in the store",
    "uh you know we want to see uh not",
    "crowding",
    "uh and that's the responsibility of of",
    "these companies",
    "uh to make sure that that that happens",
    "so i think you think we're",
    "certainly gonna see see that um",
    "as far as fairness and compliance look i",
    "mean",
    "it's always important to have fairness",
    "it's always important",
    "uh to be even-handed and uh the goal",
    "and we've instructed the inspectors um",
    "and their background is that their job",
    "normal job is to make sure that there's",
    "a safe work environment",
    "same thing making sure there's a safe",
    "work environment",
    "uh we're not in a gotcha business uh",
    "we're in the business of",
    "you know if there's a problem telling",
    "the owner there's a problem telling the",
    "manager there's a problem",
    "hey this is how you fix it this is what",
    "you need to do",
    "so we intend to work with people but but",
    "people have a right when they go into a",
    "retail establishment to feel that most",
    "the people in there are going to have a",
    "mask on",
    "and if you work there you have the right",
    "to think that people come in the door",
    "gonna have a mask on too",
    "governor next question is the last",
    "question for today and it belongs to",
    "kenny bass of wchs",
    "in charleston west virginia governor",
    "thanks for stopping by our region this",
    "week it was good to hear from you",
    "in our area um i i don't want to go too",
    "far down any conspiratorial",
    "rabbit holes here but there are many and",
    "you've even",
    "referred to people today who could",
    "dismiss you as a tyrant",
    "imposing your will but i would say that",
    "there are many",
    "moderate fair-minded people in the",
    "country",
    "who have legitimate concerns about",
    "government power",
    "and the ability it has to influence our",
    "lives and so how do you",
    "help ease their any concerns they might",
    "have about",
    "what limits that you see your power as",
    "governor",
    "should be imposed upon and and how we're",
    "not sliding down this hole",
    "to where more and more things are denied",
    "or taken away",
    "uh whether it's good-natured or not i",
    "mean there is a constitutional right to",
    "freedom of assembly",
    "curfews i know have been proven to be",
    "held up in court under emergency",
    "circumstances",
    "but there are many who have a lot of",
    "concern and worry",
    "about this country even in the midst of",
    "a pandemic",
    "fundamentally changing in some way well",
    "kenny i think that's a very good point",
    "and i think it's something it's a it's a",
    "caution",
    "that all of us should hear who are in",
    "government uh all of us who are making",
    "decisions um",
    "you know throughout this uh we've been",
    "very clear that",
    "uh we're not gonna violate the first",
    "amendment",
    "and some people have criticized me for",
    "doing that some people have said well",
    "you needed to shut churches down i said",
    "i'm not gonna shut churches down",
    "some people said you need to shut",
    "demonstrations down i'm not going to do",
    "that some people have said",
    "political rallies you need to tell them",
    "you know i beg",
    "people to do things at rallies and beg",
    "people to do",
    "but but you know so there's there's a",
    "there's a limit",
    "and i think we have to have respect for",
    "our constitution",
    "we have to have respect certainly for",
    "the first amendment",
    "and i believe that we have shown that",
    "throughout this",
    "um so we're going to continue to do that",
    "but it's a it's a good",
    "it certainly is a good uh is a good",
    "caution",
