so
so
so
so
zones five of them being odot
contractors as you noted to better
protect
our employees and our contractors
we've partnered with colonel fambro and
the highway patrol to set up airspeed
enforcement
zones around the state and they're going
to be lots of them
and we're going to continue them not
only this into next year
some of the construction airspeed
enforcement zones include
i-75 and allen county u.s 23 and
wyandotte
i-70 and clark county i-71 and i-75 and
hamilton county
in belmont county and washington county
i-71
us-33 and athens county when you're
traveling through these
when people are driving traveling
through these construction zones
they're going to see signage alerting
them that their speed
is going to be patrolled by air so what
we're
about is improving safety uh following
your direction your leadership to make
ohio safer
when people are traveling on its
roadways
well it must be very scary for
construction workers uh jack who are who
are out there
if if we've lost did you say five this
year
yes sir yes sir we have and these people
have to go out again after near misses
we've had several near misses
and it rattles people who just want to
go home to their families
every day after work just like you and i
do sir
well well thank you for sharing that
with us
it's something we you know i don't think
we really think about when we drive we
see a construction zone and
is what it is but uh you know sometimes
we forget there
are people out there who are building
that road or repairing that road and
people who
whose lives are really in our hands as
as and
other drivers and so i guess the message
is
slow down stay awake slow down move over
stay
alert when you're driving through these
construction zones governor people's
lives
literally depend on it director thank
you thank you very much
appreciate that uh each week for the
last several weeks at least i've been
talking about my concern about gun
violence
in ohio an absolute necessity
that we have to strengthen ohio's laws
in this area particularly in regard
to people who are using guns who have no
right to use a gun
people who are convicted felons who are
not supposed to have guns in the first
place
since last week since last week at least
39 more people have been shot in ohio
15 of them died
from wbns in columbus the headline
five-year-old girl
in stable condition after shooting on
south fifth
street according to reports this child
was at home
in bed when someone fired shots into her
home
and shot her and hit her in the back
a five-year-old in her own bed
shot from the dayton daily news
18 year old woman 18 year old dating
woman shot to death
suspect in jail court records show the
suspect
was prohibited from carrying a gun due
to previous
felony convictions from wcpo in
cincinnati
middletown k-9 officer and murder
suspect
shot as police chase ends in mason
luckily reports say the officer is
expected to recover
court records show the suspect was
prohibited from carrying a gun
due to previous felony convictions
most gun crimes are committed by people
who do not legally have the right to
have
those guns there is a bill
in the general assembly today that would
allow our judges
give them more discretion allow them to
impose
longer sentences at their discretion
to deal with people who are violent
repeat offenders who insist on
continuing
to travel in their car with guns or have
guns on their person
you can talk to any chief of police in
ohio that will tell you
particularly the bigger cities that this
is a problem and we have to go after
those
individuals so again i would ask the
legislature
to move on that bill
over the weekend u.s marshals rescued
dozens of missing children
across ohio many of whom were being
trafficked
human trafficking is a tragedy that
occurs every day in the united states
and sadly ohio is no exception
this morning i talked with pete elliott
united states marshal for the northern
district of ohio about the efforts
that he and the men and women of the
marshall service have carried out
in conjunction with local law
enforcement uh they've also
had help from their media partners wtam
1100 radio
fox 8 in cleveland
they feature fox 8 tv features local
human traffic and survivor amanda berry
on their segments on missing children
and also help from former browns
quarterback
bernie kozar a great great effort
as attorney general i created a human
trafficking task force that supported
local law enforcement
investigating human trafficking rescuing
survivors and prosecuting johns and
other perpetrators
the task force identified hundreds of
potential human trafficking victims and
successfully
connected them with supportive social
services as governor
i was proud to sign senate bill 5 last
year which
increased penalties for trafficking of
minors
it's important that all ohioans
recognize the signs of human trafficking
young people that often run away
individuals that move often or
frequently talk about traveling
if a young person is with someone who is
older
controlling boyfriend some young person
who's
rarely alone doesn't appear to be a
parent
signs of physical abuse including
malnutrition
young people who lack identification
we would hope to see this program
expanded
i know marshall elliott told me that
this is
they've been working working well in the
cleveland area we would hope to see this
expanded
throughout the state of ohio and as i
told marshall this morning the same
thing we can do to help expand that
we will certainly be willing to do it
not all runaways are trafficked
but a large percentage of those who are
trafficked are in fact runaways
eric let's go to our slides uh and sadly
we have a real jump in cases 1453 cases
which is our highest
number since the end of july this is a
stark reminder that the
virus is not going away
we think that a significant part of this
is caused by our colleges going back
as well as our uh grade schools and in
high schools going going back um and
we're seeing
uh some cases reported out of some of
our our colleges
uh let me just say this uh when it's
reported out of colleges we should thank
the colleges for doing the testing
uh because just because there are
cases there there may be cases other
places if the testing is not
in fact taking place we have to do
everything we can to protect each other
while trying to safely do the things
that we all want to do and need to do
work go to school
our highest number of cases report in
august was on the
12th when we had 1422 cases so
not happy with those numbers our
hospitalizations as you'll see in deaths
are slightly higher than what they have
been in in recent weeks
uh eric let's go to our top 88 counties
uh put these um in order
and you can see uh our we all start at
the top we'll go the
low part uh shout out to harrison noble
ashland muskingum carroll guernsey
counties
these counties are at the low end of of
of the
of the 88. uh eric let's go the top ten
we start again to remind everyone what
this is
two week period of time the last two
weeks uh snapshot
what's happened in the last two weeks as
far as a number of cases
it is figured by population 100
000 population uh so you'll see for
example putnam
uh is number one uh they had 79 cases
actually
but if you do that based on a hundred
thousand
that's 233 so they start off so it's
putting them dark
jackson meigs mercer henry shelby butler
montgomery and in all glaze again we're
seeing a real
movement into our rural areas montgomery
is the only county of those
top 10 that is an urban that is an
urban county
putman county health department is
attributing a lot of the cases to
community spread
social settings family gatherings
again we remind everyone no matter what
county they're in
the wearing of the mask we've seen it
we've really seen what it's been able to
do
in our urban counties we know what it
can do across
the state of ohio i was on a call with
the white house
yesterday the vice president vice
president pence
and the folks at the white house who are
focused on this every single day
uh they have a grave concern about labor
day coming up and they ask
me and the other governors to talk
directly to the people
of our states about labor day holidays
are when we get together
we have fun we can get together we can
have fun but we've got to be very
very careful
many people it marks the end of summer
uh kind of a
milestone it's an opportunity to get to
get together
but as we gather uh with families and
friends we must remember
that whenever there's more activity
we're going to see more cases
i'd like to take a look at what we've
seen from previous long weekends this
summer
and what we've been seeing recently in
our communities
we saw a lot of movement around the
state over the fourth of july weekend
and then
after that we saw a significant spread
of the virus
many of this was comes out of what you'd
expect of the fourth of july family
gatherings being with friends to
celebrate the holiday
we know it takes about a week or maybe
two for people to develop symptoms after
coming into contact with someone who is
contagious
uh we should remember that some people
may not show symptoms of being sick
at all and they can be contagious
cases and positivity were already going
up in june after
we reopened as people got together
though during the fourth of july
we saw our cases increase even more by
mid-july we were averaging close to 1500
cases per day
and our positivity rate was an average
of 6.5
percent eric let's look at this slide
this is a slide we showed you before
we talked about this case before i want
to show you again
as an example of just how a kind of
benign
what would seem to be a benign uh happy
trip
uh to a lake result in significant
community spread a couple with their
daughter and a family friend
rode in the same vehicle on a 40-minute
trip to a lake
in ohio the family friend had covered 19
but she did not know it at the time
as you can see from this graphic uh that
case led to an additional
nine cases it also led to the temporary
closing of three businesses
a vacation employee from one of those
businesses was quarantined in a hotel
room
and another was told on her wedding day
that she faced possible quarantine
and the daughter from the car ride who
was trying to get her first teaching job
had her hiring process delayed
more recently other cases just in the
past few weeks we've heard from several
of our local health departments about
spread
associated again with family friends
gathering together
for example in lake county the parent
traveled out of state and came home the
day before a birthday party that
included high school athletes
from multiple jurisdictions the parent
got sick
uh the day after the party and now there
are four confirmed cases
associated with that party in another
lake
county example a group of teens who
worked together at a grocery store
attended a birthday party together in
mid
mid august there are now three
associated cases
to date and one person who
does not have symptoms who's waiting for
test results
the attendees at the party have said
that there were no masks
no social distancing taking place at the
party
another case a neighbor attended a
family card game in trumbull county with
three members of the same family
the neighbor got sick the day after the
card game and now all the family members
are positive
two of the family members passed along
to their spouses
putnam county there are now 10 cases
associated with a large gulf outing
held on august 21st
but certainly not everything we're
hearing is bad a lot
a lot of good things that are in fact
going on i'll share a couple stories
in regard to that first of all let me
just say i
i truly believe that our schools uh k-12
schools
our colleges our universities uh planned
for this
uh and they're doing a very very good
job i talked this morning
uh to rush school superintendent steve
rose
uh who told me that their seventh to
twelfth grade is now
going remote gone remote because they
had a case
uh before they had one student uh who
tested
positive and that was due to communities
spread
as we've said before schools are going
to have cases
they're going to have positive cases
because they're in the community and
they reflect the community when there is
widespread
community spread uh there's going to be
spread within those schools
we should understand that when the data
is published and when you see in the
paper
like last night i saw on on dayton tv
about rushi uh that's why i called the
superintendent this morning
we see about that but what that really
means is they're doing
their job uh they're following protocol
they're following their plan uh
so in this case uh the urushi folks did
a very very good job did exactly what
what they should do and that's
i think something we should all remember
when we see that there is a
case in a school all that means is that
school's focused on it
and they're doing the tracing and
they're doing what they what they need
to do
another example in youngstown there are
two catholic high schools that use
youngstown state
facilities for football games tickets
for recent games were all pre-purchased
uh only by families and loved ones of
players cheerleaders and band members
and the school sent daily reminders to
parents
about social distancing and masking
the youngstown city school
city health district purchased large
signs to reinforce masking and social
distancing
and health department staff including
the health commissioner the
environmental health director and others
worked during games offering free mass
to anyone who did not have one and
greeting fans with handouts and a
message welcome
mask on game on and please remember the
social distance
when in the stadium they also reinforced
the message in the stands and the
concession areas
during games schools used the scoreboard
and made numerous announcements to
remind fans about social distancing and
mask worrying
one coach assigned players designated
spots on the sidelines to ensure social
distancing so from both these schools
as well as the public schools that they
hosted
that was just really really great news
and they followed the guidelines that
they should that they should follow
in canton a local football team had two
players who were confirmed to have coven
19.
the players and coaches quickly isolated
the players and notified the local
health department
the health department quickly
quarantined those who had been in close
contact with the two positive cases
the outbreak and this is something that
is significant
the outbreak was limited to those two
players with five people quarantined
as a precaution the school had already
implemented the recommended guidelines
for
player practices involving social
distancing worrying of face coverings
and more
this is a great example of a school
having a proper plan in place
and executing that plan and cooperating
with the local health officials to keep
cover 19 in check
again having a plan carrying out the
plan
and the cooperation can result
in fewer people being quarantined we've
seen examples occasionally when there's
not the
cooperation and you see a lot more
people end up getting getting
quarantined
the toledo lucas county health
department like so many of our health
departments has worked with schools
to send consistent messaging that
students should not be attending
mass ever gatherings and so we thank
them for that
in one instance a party was attended by
students including athletes from two
school districts
the school said they would halt
athletics if those in attendance did not
come forward
it was a clear message to everyone in
the community
holding or allowing parties is a
liability to academics
athletics and the spread of covid 19.
another such party that had been planned
and promoted on social media did not go
forward life is full of trade-offs
and we want our kids in school which we
do we want our school playing athletics
which we do we want them
uh doing other extracurricular
activities um
then the way to do that is for us to
slow this spread down
uh speaking of schools i want to turn uh
to our education order the education
order will be issued in the next several
days last week i talked about issuing
the order
on reporting covet 19 in our schools
as i said we're still working on the
exact language of the order and we'll
get it out shortly
when it's complete we will of course
post it on our coronavirus.ohio
uh so everyone can read it but let me
reiterate a couple of the goals or three
of the goals
that we have
number one if you have a child
in school and your child has come into
contact with someone
who later tests positive uh
for for covid within the relevant period
of time
then you have every right to know that
and so the school should notify you and
will notify you
of that fact second
uh we want parents to know if there's
anyone in their child's school building
who has in fact tested positive
so again not the specific names of
course in any of these
but we want the schools first of course
contact the parents
if they have come in contact with that
child
and they can work then with the local
health department
second though if you're just in the in
the school building itself
we want the school to notify the parents
and third we want to notify the public
once this has occurred and so that will
be a report that will be issued
by the state health department
uh once a week our goal is to be as open
as transparent as possible
so families can be informed
if there are if there are cases in
school again it doesn't mean that
anybody did anything wrong
if they found the cases and are acting
accordingly it means they're doing
they're doing the things that that are
right it's
you're going to see many many cases in
you're going to see many
times when there are cases in schools
just because of what we see
in the community let's turn to our
colleges
in july we put out our guidance for ohio
state public
and private colleges universities and
technical institutions to open in the
safest
way possible administrators have been
planning and taking steps to allow for
social distancing
provide more living space on campuses
and other measures
now that students are returning to
classes both in person and virtually we
thought we would invite
some students to share their experiences
on campus
first i'd like to introduce nicholas
juan
javi
bose um air bows
excuse me avi how you doing hey how are
you doing governor
i'm i'm i'm good hey thanks for joining
us
where are you from yes i'm from cary
ohio and so i graduated
graduated from cary high school in
wyandotte county and you're going to
school where now
uh bowling green state university all
right you want to tell us a little bit
about
the experience this year it's a little
little different than
past experiences yeah absolutely it's
definitely been a different change
uh from my previous three years at bgsu
it's definitely with the detentification
of our campus there's a lot less
students
on our campus which has been i think the
biggest change in my experience
uh however i know the things that we've
done uh as
bgsu and our return to campus plan has
been for the benefit
um to help us have uh this in-person
instruction
um and experience that we want to the
the closest to
a traditional college experience as we
can and so it's definitely been a
definite change
but i think from my experience and
discussions with my peers it's been
going very very well and it's been an
effective change
to continue we have 13 weeks left and
we are all in this together as bgsu and
i hope we can continue to do that moving
forward
well you are i see that you're the
studio body vice president
you all managed to have an election
somehow right yes
that was that was definitely a change as
well um a lot of not just
the undergraduate student government but
organizations in general
um with everything changing and back in
march
i had to do a lot of a lot of quick
changes in relation to
to getting their new president's new
leadership in the organization so a lot
um as as classes as well all went
virtual
um so we did our best um as student
leaders to be able to facilitate that in
the most effective way
so so tell me um uh javi tell me a
little bit about the
kind of the student attitude on campus i
mean what
how how are people dealing with this i
mean this is
it's just different but i mean what's
what's what's the
what's the attitude you think among most
the students
i think it's been relatively positive uh
from
a majority if not all the students
the constant communication from whether
it's professors and faculty members or
the higher administration
at our institution it's been a
constant reassurance that we
as students are first in mind when it
comes to decisions that are being made
i know there's been a little bit of a
change within like student activities
and student involvement
but we we have done everything we
possibly can with the
while maintaining compliance to to
continue that traditional experience
with
being able to meet in person as long as
it's a
maximum of ten individuals six feet
physical distancing and facial coverings
at all time
all times we've created spaces where
that can be done effectively to be able
to have that
experience it's just a lot of change as
you as you noted
but i think the overall attitude has
been pretty positive
because we have done very well as an
institution to really maintain that
traditional experience
so are you taking some courses online
yes uh so i have
so bjc went with three different course
delivery methods
and so that's strictly online which is
an asynchronous course it's a self-paced
course we have a remote option which is
a synchronous course so you meet at a
certain time just at a remote location
and then we have an in-person and hybrid
course delivery method as well
which is a little bit of both um where
we go to class maintaining
all the compliance set by our university
and health organizations
um but it's still able to have that
in-person educational experience
so i have one in the hybrid method and
it's going
i would say very well we wipe our desks
down
after each class and then
when the next course comes in they would
wipe the desk down again to ensure that
it was
cleaned properly so we're taking all the
necessary steps to be able to have that
traditional educational
experience as well so javi uh
college experience uh you know part of
the experience of
college is socialization meeting new
people
going to parties going to bars doing all
kinds of
things so so how how do you balance
that uh can't that can't that can't be
easy
you've got the the threat of spread of
the
the virus just on campus just like you
do anyplace else
how how do you balance that
i think it comes down to discontinuation
of programming
um that the institution can put on um so
i know
last evening we did an alpha art
activity where you could go
and create your name um with different
types of letters that
that were pictures that were taken um
just
from a lot of different locations um so
being able to be involved within
specifically
on campus because we can guarantee as an
institution that this on-campus
experience is going to be safe
right and so how can we
ensure that the safety is going to
happen off campus and really it comes
down to
you as an individual as how can you do
your part to maintain
the safety of your peers and individuals
around you
and so we have implemented a falcon
commitment
um we have provided options if you
didn't feel safe
to attend campus you could have taken
your classes completely online
undone it from a remote location whether
it's at home or or
simply from your apartment bedroom
however
um for those who decided to come in
person and have that
close to a traditional experience we've
had these really expectations set in
place
that we continue to push forward to
make sure you're doing your part to help
us get these 13 weeks
together hobby thank you very much i
forgot to say your community
communication major right
i am good you're doing a good good job
communicating today
thank you we appreciate it and good luck
to you and the other students at bowling
green
appreciate it very very much return now
to
ohio state um with us
is anand shaw originally from
centerville
and majoring in biomedical research
thanks for joining us we appreciate it
thanks for having me governor dewine
how's how's how's the experience this
year
the experience has definitely been
something different um but i think it's
been exciting
to return i mean every year it's
exciting to come back to campus i think
this year it's been exciting
uh for definitely a couple of different
reasons i think being able to walk
around campus you get to see the way
that students are responding
uh to the pandemic and i think there's a
level of perseverance hope and optimism
about
the ability for us to work together to
be able to take our campus and
to be able to stay on campus i mean when
it comes to
what i thought when i was going to come
back it was are students actually going
to wear masks their students actually
going to stay socially distant are
students going to be within their
parties of less than 10.
and i think it's been interesting to see
that in a time in an interesting paradox
where
in a time when we're supposed to be you
know physically distant and apart
i think the campus has come more
together than i've ever seen
and so that comes not only when you look
at people on the oval who are sitting
you know in their independent circles
six feet apart or when you see people
working out in the r pack
which is a recreational facility and
they're working and working out in a
physically distance
environment and even when you just walk
around campus i think there's 30 000
kids that are walking around
our campus every day and it would be
it's
amazing to be able to see the amount of
kids that have their masks on everybody
um walking physically distant on making
sure to stay safe so it's
it's been a very exciting time i would
say i have a lot of hope and um
i've really seen that we've really come
together as buckeyes
um and we've i think we found our why is
really just trying to
make sure we can have our opportunity to
stay here as long as possible
so ohio state's doing a lot of testing a
significant amount of testing
uh they're putting it up on on on a web
page
from the time you've been back on campus
how long
i'm back on campus for about uh this is
my second week so we've been back on
campus for about
about four days so yeah so any
difference between uh
when you came on campus the first day uh
and now means is more people were in
mass
same any kind of difference in attitude
as you talk to
talk to students yeah absolutely i mean
i think there's a greater understanding
day by day there's a greater and greater
recognition
that the ability for our campus to stay
open and the ability for our campus to
stay healthy is really the hands of the
students that are here i mean we make up
the largest population of anybody who's
on our campus and it really comes down
to
making sure that we can follow those
rules stay with the guidelines and i
think an attitude has definitely changed
i think coming back to campus
there was an understanding that you know
mask wearing is a thing and that we need
to
have well fewer than 10 gatherings but i
think with help from the university help
with student leadership
we've been really able to you know have
those beliefs widespread and i think
the amount of mass wearing has
definitely increased i think people
understand that
with some of the numbers as you had
mentioned earlier that the rate in ohio
the pandemic is an ongoing thing and
it's something that isn't
going away anytime soon and i think
that's something that students are
really starting to recognize as
they have a very tangible piece of the
puzzle
um and without them and without being
able to follow those guidelines it's not
going to be
something where we'll be able to you
know enjoy senior year freshman year et
cetera so
absolutely so ownership maybe of kind of
the
the destiny you see that absolutely
absolutely i would say that
students have really taken it um from
the horns and i think that stands kind
of
how nicholas was saying where we
have student organizations all across
campus who have really started to buy in
and have bought in from day one
um to be able to make sure that the
causes that we've had across campus
kind of all come back to making sure
that we stay together as buckeyes
um to be able to make sure that every
student organization
uh can continue to run all students have
the ability to then still participate
and i think it comes down to programming
as well i mean when we look at things
like buck i thought an organization
who's raising money for pediatric cancer
typically an in-person event every
single year i think
you've seen organizations like that
transform an entire dance marathon to
being completely online
and recognizing that we can still have
the exact same impact
um where we can transform and innovate
uh in a greater sense
across our campus and i think that not
only for buck i thought but across all
student organizations we've seen
a very very uh pivotal shift but one
that i think is
utilizing innovation to make the best
out of the situation
i mean not only that making innovative
moves where i think even
outside of the pandemic will be
beneficial for students
thanks for joining us good luck to
everybody at ohio state
and thank you we appreciate it very much
we'll go now to
lieutenant governor
good afternoon governor uh i have
four items today three of them are on
broadband and one of them is a
public service announcement that we'll
go over
i want to take folks back to the
broadband connectivity grant that we
announced on july the 28th
this was 50 million dollars of cares act
funding
that we were making available to schools
and their students
to supply or meet the urgent need that
they had for high-speed internet so they
could continue their education
during the pandemic today we are making
the awards of those grants we'll be
informing
951 schools school facilities
of that their grant requests uh have
been
approved and this will go towards hot
spots and internet
internet enabled devices for broadband
connectivity
we had 83 million dollars in requests
for the 50 million dollars that we had
and so the way we handled this is that
for the smaller requests under twenty
thousand dollars uh they will get the
entire
uh requested amount for those who
qualify
and for schools that went above the
twenty thousand dollars uh they will get
the entire
twenty thousand first first twenty
thousand and then above that they will
get
uh 60 percent of
their requested amount for qualifying
purchases and this will enable there's
the good news
bottom line this will enable 121 000
students to gain
access to high-speed internet in their
homes uh
and thanks to the devices that will be
provided with this grant
so that's uh super important
additionally uh there are areas where
there are barriers to take-home devices
the grant will also
support the creation of new public wi-fi
and mobile wi-fi spaces to help students
connect to the internet
and this will enable up to 645 000
students
in schools that are increasingly either
increasing their public wi-fi
or mobile use wi-fi these students will
have places to go
the bottom line is to connect to the
internet if they don't have access
to it in their homes and by the end of
the week all the schools will receive
the notifications of this
and they can begin to purchase the items
that they need
so good news uh for
you know hundreds of thousands of
students who needed improved access to
the internet
we're getting that out to them this week
another broadband if you if you go back
to the telehealth pilot project we
actually announced this in march it was
the
i remember it distinctly because it was
the first day that we had our
first case of covid19 that we reported
as you recall governor you and i
announced this telehealth pilot project
with the
switzerland of ohio school district
which is in monroe county
i know both of us have been there it's a
very rural part of the state down in
southeast ohio
switzerland of ohio was chosen because
of that fast fact they were a very
difficult
use case for this and we believe that if
we could
improve the situation there we could
provide a strong blueprint for other
schools to use
who may find themselves in a similar
situation just to review
switzerland of ohio is extremely rural
covers district district covers all of
monroe county
has significant poverty issues and had
serious
cases of mental illness mental health
mental health issues i should say
among students and their
families in the last school year as
promised
this project has yielded a lot of really
important lessons
that we hope will will help other school
districts a couple of those lessons
first of all
we now understand the regulation the
regulation
restrictions and complications that can
come particularly regarding hipaa rules
so we have been able to work through
those
we understand better the facilities and
infrastructure is neat
excuse me needed to provide private
telehealth services to students
we understand the staff resources that
are necessary particularly on the
the i.t side and we understand how
a school needs to what they can do to
leverage a relationship with an area
health care provider
so the takeaway frankly for students
teachers and school leaders if
you think you could benefit from this
telehealth program
and we know a lot of schools can
particularly
for mental health services
this pilot project will provide the
blueprint
blueprint for that and we continue to
we'll continue to learn from it
you can find the blueprint at
innovate.ohio.gov forward slash
broadband
that's innovate.org
forward slash broadband so any school
district that wants to understand how
they can do this
the information's there and if that's
not enough you just call
my office and we will make sure we get
you to the correct resources
an additional broadband update this is
with the
csi the common sense initiative ai tool
we announced not too long ago that we
have acquired the licenses for an
artificial intelligence tool to go
through all of the ohio
revised code and and administrative code
to streamline it and this is this
research idea came from the
telecommunications industry itself
because in many cases
they find regulatory challenges and
it's confusing to them sometimes on how
they can expand broadband
uh as regulated entities and
the csi team took a big look at this
they took a look using the new
artificial intelligence tool
they noticed that there were a lot of
common definitions but this is an
interesting thing that they found there
are
303 definitions in ohio on rules
and statutes across 25 different
agencies regulating broadband
for example there are 16 definitions of
public utility
in ohio law across five different
agencies all of this
in some way connected to broadband so we
want to streamline this
we want to make it easier for these
tele telecom entities and
agencies to to help
expand broadband across the state
and this is one regulatory reform we can
do to help with that
uh to put this in perspective what the
new ai tool does for us
it literally would have taken a team of
people a month uh
in their subject areas to get this done
the i the ai tool took it
took it on in two days and now we're
going to get those subject matter
experts
to work with us uh on getting this
streamlined so it's just
these are the ways we're trying to use
technology to innovate and make it
easier to provide the services in the
private sector
to the public that needs it and then
finally
we have a psa a public service
announcement
that we're making today and i really
need to give you
a little bit of background to put this
in context
a few months ago i heard a story about a
world war ii veteran i was on a phone
call heard about the story of a world
war ii veteran who when asked
about the idea of wearing a mask to
fight the war
against the spread of the coronavirus he
simply said well
when i was young they asked me to go to
normandy normandy and fight the germans
and
it seems like wearing a mask is a pretty
easy alternative to that
well that's hard to argue with and i
remember thinking at the time
when i heard that story uh that just you
know
the small sacrifices were being asked to
make
uh you know this this story really puts
it in perspective and so
i asked if we could meet this this
gentleman
and see if he might share some thoughts
with us and and he certainly was willing
to do that and i want to introduce to
you world war ii veteran
jim peewee martin
and uh uh he is
um a 99 year old um who
jim martin is who lives in sugar creek
township which is a green county
uh a county that's near and dear to the
governor uh
he's uh one of ohio and america's true
heroes in my opinion and jim just give a
little more background on him he
volunteered
he volunteered uh to be a world war ii
paratrooper
and an original member of company g
the third battalion 506 parachute
infantry
infantry regiment in 101st airborne
division
and uh his nickname peewee was earned
because he was 106 pounds which
was the smallest and lightest guy in his
company
and in 1944 jim jumped into france
over utah beach the night prior to d-day
uh and he fought 33 days in the normandy
campaign and he also fought in holland
belgium in germany and among his awards
jim earned the bronze star in the purple
heart
for his great work a true american hero
and during this time when we're fighting
the war against the coronavirus
jim has a little message that he
recorded for us that we would like to
share right now
i am jim pewee martin i served as a
paratrooper in world war
ii as a world war ii veteran
a lot of us did our duty during that war
in this war against the coronavirus
i will wear my ass to protect
others it seems pretty easy it's very
little to ask
please do your part and thank you for
your service
yeah he's he's an american treasure and
uh
i will just say in conclusion governor
uh you know
makes me want to wear a mask to protect
people like jim
pee-wee martin who sacrificed for us and
it's a small thing to ask of others and
and so we all should hear jim's call and
service to one another during this
difficult time
so i'll turn it back over to you
governor lieutenant governor thank you
uh jim martin has been a friend of our
families for
a long long time one thing the
lieutenant governor did not tell you is
he's made a few more jumps
and did that not too long ago actually
so jim's a a treasure a national
treasure we're very very
uh proud that he is from from greene
county but we're just proud of him
thanks jim appreciate it very much ready
for questions
governor your first question is from
molly martinez of spectrum news
hi governor thanks so much for doing
this the legislature met today to
discuss
hb6 and former speaker of the house
larry householder was there
do you still support hb6 as law given
everything surrounding it
and what does it mean that he was on the
floor today
speaking about householder
well i think i've been pretty clear
that hb6 needs needs to be repealed
we need to start over again and
he needs to be replaced we've got jobs
at stake we've also for the foreseeable
future the vast
vast vast majority of our non-carbon
generating electricity is nuclear
and so if we lose the nuclear we've lost
most of most of that
but we need to start over so we've got
to repeal it
legislature we're happy to work with the
legislature to figure out you know
what where we go from here but i think
hb6 has been so tainted um
by what came out uh and what was
disclosed
that it needs to be needs to be repealed
as far as the speaker uh former speaker
being on the floor he is still a member
uh so he has a has a right to be there
um you know that's his his call
next question is from tom gallick at
gangwar news service
hi governor looks like you might be
getting
civil immunity legislation on your desk
pretty soon and you've talked about the
importance of your strong ohio plan
i wondered what else would you like to
see from the legislature in the coming
weeks and months
well we've got significant reform bill
in regard to
police a bill that begins to treat at
least like the
professional job that it really is
which means it'll be a board um
an oversight oversight board just like
for a nurse just like for a doctor
i think that's very important i think
it's important to put in statute that
when there is a
police shooting that that needs to be
for a police officer shoot someone
that that investigation that always
takes place
but that investigation needs to be done
outside that that particular police
department
i think that is that is appropriate so
there's a lot of other things in this
bill but it's it's it's a bill
that really has been has been worked on
by the fop uh from our police
uh by local law enforcement by
community members and it's the
it's really the right thing to do and as
we see continue to see
you know cases across the country that
draw a lot of attention and tragic
tragic cases
you know i think we need to remember
that there is a bill in ohio
and we can pass this bill won't solve
every problem but i think it it will
certainly
deal with some problems uh and and
you know there's no police officer i've
ever found who didn't think
it was a profession and we need to treat
it
that way and there's no police officer
i've ever talked to going back to when i
was a prosecuting attorney
who didn't think that more training was
better
and so these are some of the things that
this that this bill does and i would
i would think the timing is certainly
right and the legislature
uh should take that that bill on and
pass it
next question is from alex ebert at
bloomberg
good afternoon governor thanks so much
for having us
yesterday the ohio tax credit authority
delayed both its vote on the largest
state clawback in u.s history
60 million for gm shuttering a chevy
cruze facility
and a vote on incentives for the joint
battery facility in lordstown with lg
and gm
is gm threatening to scale back
developments in ohio if the state goes
forward with the clawback
and if not what is holding up the
negotiations thank you sir
the answer is no i'm not aware of any
threat coming from general motors
um look what we have
talked about with the lieutenant
governor i have talked about
when we have been in lordstown uh in the
mahoning valley any place
in the valley and at these press
conferences
is that general motors has been a good
partner with the state of ohio with the
people of the state of ohio they have
many plants here
we hope they continue to invest here
they employ
many workers here so while
they do owe this money because they did
not carry out all the terms
of what they said they were going to do
we're looking for
an avenue whereby we can encourage more
investment in ohio
and for whereby that we can reach some
agreement with general motors so
i talked to some members of the of the
legislature
uh about this from the mahoning valley
uh one of the things that they told us
was
you know we go back and see if you can
work something out
uh and so we're we're doing that we
think it's the right thing to do
we don't know what that will be
uh but we hope that there'll be a
win-win uh win for the people the state
of ohio where we can see more jobs
created
uh and a win for for general motors uh
if we can't get an agreement
then we can't get an agreement we'll
have plenty of time to
you know to go after them in regard to
to the money
but it would be best if we can work
something out we're going to try to do
that
governor i just wanted to add that we're
having
regular productive conversations with
them
we recognize our mutual obligation
they have an obligation to the taxpayers
of the state of ohio and we have an
obligation
to them as well and at the same time we
want them to be successful and we want
them
uh we want gm to to have a successful
partnership with the state of ohio and
more more so
continue to create jobs for the people
of the state of ohio and
and those construct that constructive
dialogue is ongoing
thank you next question is from scott
hallas at the
xenia daily gazette
whoops head on mute hey governor how are
you doing today just got
um kind of a two-part question i had a
phone call with mike turner earlier
today to talk a little bit about
space command um and he said you know
green county and ohio is going to put
together
a really good bid to try and land it
here um
a you know he said he's working with
with the state to have a good unified
bid so what exactly is the state
you know doing to help bring that to
ohio and then what would it mean to
greene county to land something like
this with you know 1400 more jobs and
some good high-paying jobs
well i have been we have been working
with mike turner i know mike has really
taken the lead
on this and doing a very very good job
he has a big
vision uh as as we do we think that this
is an opportunity we think that we
should be
not only competitive but uh you know we
ought to we ought to win this uh we've
got so many things going for us at
right pat one of the first things i did
when i became governor is ask jose's
who has real experience at wright
patterson air force base to
join our team to be focused on
aerospace and so he has been working on
on this as well so we think we're we're
very very competitive uh we think this
is where
you know those jobs belong so we're
we're in the game
next question is from kevin landers at
wbns
in columbus hello governor
hey kevin ohioans are conflicted by the
medical information they're receiving
there are questions about
the effectiveness of mass questions
about the true number of deaths
related directly to covid19 and there
are also questions about what ohio's end
game is if the vaccine is not found soon
all of these questions are happening
without a director of the department of
health
are you concerned about the science
you're being fed what is the status of
replacing dr amy acton
thank you very much um we are vigorously
searching for that person um
but this is an important job and we have
to have the right person
uh when i filled the position originally
with dr
acton she was the last member of the
cabinet to be pit
um and it was not that we didn't have
other good candidates we did
but i felt that the role was so
essential obviously the role is even
more essential today
in in the in the pandemic so um
we we have some leads we're talking to
some people but nothing
yet to announce um i'm uh
impatient about this as i am about a lot
of things so we we would like to get
that
individual on board but we're not we're
not quite there
yet as far as the issues that you talked
about
uh that where there is a as you
described in a dispute
um all due respect i'm not sure there's
a lot of dispute
uh amassed the jury as we used to say
when i was a prosecutor the jury
jurors reached a verdict um masked
by every credible person in the medical
field
is saying that masks are are in fact
important
we can point to the date when we started
mask at our urban areas in the state of
ohio
and you can go forward a week or two
weeks and you started to see
numbers change uh when the mass
compliance went up um you know you see
you see results and so we have we have
seen that
in our urban areas uh we we hope to see
more of it in the in the rural we're
seeing somewhat in the world
seeing people being more compliant uh
and we know that that will make a huge
huge difference and so as long as you as
you say as long as you don't have a
vaccine
you know the mask and the social
distancing are absolutely
you know the key things um that
are important the other is sanitation
wash your hands and the other is being
outside i mean those are all variables
and we know
each one uh does in fact work as far as
the number of deaths
you know i saw i've seen stuff on the
internet i saw
what was what was put out out of
washington
all that really means is that when
someone
dies i think they had like six percent
were
only listed as a coronavirus the other
ones had
other causes on there look that should
not surprise uh
any of us uh the people have
other medical problems uh and if they
have another medical problem that
problem will
will get listed uh on on the death
certificate
so i don't think that's that shouldn't
be a shock to anybody
um you know we've known in ohio uh the
older a person gets
uh you know their
possibilities of survival is still good
even
even at a high age but it goes down and
we know it goes down and statistically
we have seen that and we also know
statistically that as people get older
they pick up more
other medical problems that's just a
fact of
of life and and so these numbers i don't
think
you know change anything uh as far as
um what what we know about
covert 19 and what we know about the
desk
next question is from jesse ballmert at
the cincinnati enquirer
hello governor my question is the
cincinnati police chief
wrote in a letter that there had been
some unintended consequences
from the early bar closure things like
multiple shootings and assaults at
unprecedented levels in the city of
cincinnati so i guess would you respond
to those concerns
yeah i've talked to mayor cranley
uh today about that i talked to mayor
cranley about that
uh last week uh as well and he expressed
that
to me so what the chief said in his
letter to me was not a
not a surprise um you know we value our
close working relationships with local
government they're the ones who are
on the on the scene uh other mayors
uh in ohio uh because i've specifically
asked them
mayor ginther mayor bailey
for example have told me that they
adamantly feel that the 10 o'clock
shutoff of liquor is very important to
their communities and to their cities
so we are at this point consulting our
lawyers
to see you know is it possible to carve
out cincinnati
out of a out of a statewide order
and and frankly our lawyers um
the initial read they gave us was they
were very skeptical if we legally could
do that
but uh they're gonna research it and uh
you know we're gonna
see what they what they come up with
again we believe that overall in the
state has worked well
but we respect the mayor in cincinnati
mayor cranley respect the chief
they have described unintended
consequences basically where people
uh leave the bar and then uh you know
because they can't drink there anymore
and they go off to a park or someplace
else and
so we we understand that uh
but i think clearly the majority of
mayors in the state by far uh believe
just the opposite
uh and they believe that the ten o'clock
has been has been very very helpful
so we think statewide it has been
helpful
as well so we're going to see what we
can do for cincinnati we can't promise
anything again
we've consulted the lawyers to see if
there's something we can do here
next question is from andy chow at ohio
public radio and television
andy hi governor i just wanted to ask
about
just your take on the latest lawsuit
filed against the state
uh now in federal court just going
against the
the different orders that that they say
keep ohio shut down although we know
that a lot of businesses are reopened do
you have any take on the latest lawsuit
no not re not really uh you know we've
i've been sued many many times over this
the health department's been sued many
many times i mean i don't know how many
um you know they've been in many
different counties
and going into federal court i suppose
it's something that we would
would have expected so no i don't i
don't have any comment about it i mean
we're doing what
um you know we know uh will make a
difference
we know that this economy cannot move
forward that people cannot have jobs
unless we keep the virus down we've got
to keep the virus down
you know we've been i think very
thoughtful about what we have done
uh the state is basically open
there are some restrictions there's
restrictions we just talked about for
example in regard to liquor
we've tried to take cases for example
and come up with a responsible way to
approach them high school
football high school other other sports
cross country
you know we know there's some danger to
that and spread but we also know there's
really good reasons why uh young people
need to be able to
participate and so we've we've come up
with
a compromise where we don't have any
spectators other than
families and we let the athletes play
so you know we try to to work this thing
out
one of the things i think we sometimes
forget is none of these decisions are
made in a vacuum
and that's true not only for the
decisions i make as governor that's also
true for
individuals as ohio citizens 11.7
million ohioans we're making decisions
every day and none of those decisions
could be made
you know in in a vacuum uh we want to
live with this virus but we don't want
to see the virus
come up and consume us and so it's
trying to find that
that that sweet spot that happy medium
that we strive for every single day so
the lawsuits i'm sure
people will continue to sue us but look
i i just have to stay focused on
on what we need to be doing in ohio
next question is from ben schwartz at
wcpo in cincinnati
hi governor um i'd like to just quickly
ask
a kind of a follow-up to what you were
recently asked by the enquirer
about police chief elliot of
cincinnati's letter to you
is it safe to say that ohioans shouldn't
expect a statewide change
in the order regarding bars and
restaurants closing at 10 o'clock
anytime soon
well we are going to i mean we took this
seriously i mean this is not i think
we're blown off
and this is something that you know when
chief says something we take it
seriously
when mayor says something we take it
seriously um
and we're trying to see you know if
there is there a way that we can do that
the preliminary conversation i had with
our lawyer today was
uh it's gonna be difficult but they're
gonna they're gonna look at it and
they're gonna get back to me and i'll
certainly share that with
uh with with everyone with the public
and with the mayor and
and with the chief
next question is from angela ingram at
wkrc
in cincinnati
we'll come back to angela next question
is from uh
spencer hickey at hannah news services
thank you governor just following up on
the bars
we've seen a number of ones that were
cited by the state patrol's ohio
inspection or investigative unit
in some cases multiple times for
violating the health orders and i was
just wondering if you had any
comment on some of that
uh no not really i mean there's a
process as you know they go in front of
the liquor control commission the liquor
control
commission hears the evidence and they
make a decision
uh they have you know made some
decisions there's more cases pending and
you know i'm sure they'll continue to to
process those those cases
but the you know the investigative unit
will continue to do
what they do which is to go out and to
you know make sure
sure the laws are are being enforced
next question is from jim oddi at whio
in dayton governor what the level of
detail will you be requiring
for uh k-12 schools the reporting of
coronavirus cases
but still protecting privacy and then
secondly who's who's going to be doing
the contact tracing of these schools
uh contact tracing you know is going to
be done by at the county level
um you know we are there to back the
back them up we have contact tracers if
a county needs it
we have a number of counties where we
have contact tracers who are assisting
them
uh really depends on the size of the of
the outbreak but
this is you know what we've encouraged
and what we've seen is a very close
working relationship between the local
health department and the local school
you know i kind of jokingly told the
superintendents a few months ago i said
you know if you don't know your health
director you will
uh you know get to get to know them very
well and look i'm just very proud of
what
ohio superintendents and principals and
teachers have done across the state very
difficult circumstances
they're doing something they really
never had to do before some doing it
remotely some doing it in person some
doing hybrid
but they've all worked out they've all
looked at it and part of that
preparation is working very closely with
with their local the local health
department uh
jim second part of your first part of
your question uh you know had to do
what's
what kind of specificity are we going to
require look we've got to balance this
uh what we the law does not allow
you to give up information that clearly
pinpoints
medical information and clearly
pinpoints who that particular person
is um you know many times people will
certainly know who that person is but
that we have to be careful to follow
uh the law in that area so um you know
in all likelihood
for example uh the information um
you know first of all if you're a parent
uh and you've got a child who's come in
contact in school
with someone who now the school knows
has kova the school will
inform you as that parent that's what i
think as parents or grandparents we
would all
we would all expect second if you've got
a child in the building
in a building where someone has had
coconut you know if they have not been
in contact with your particular child
then
just you know you will be notified
everybody who has a child in that
in that building will be notified that
in fact
uh there's somebody in that building who
had who had who had coveted
uh and then and then third uh it's a
bigger
bigger picture uh you know these are
going to be reported in all likelihood
uh by by school district uh such and
such a district every week has
so many cases and that's in all likely
we haven't got it
totally worked out yet but that's in all
likelihood the way it's going to work
with those kind of three levels
next question is from adrienne robbins
at wcmh
in columbus governor thank you for doing
this
um you talked about today's case numbers
rising and possibly that being due to
cases and testing on our college
campuses
are you looking at these cases through a
different lens than our general case
count
like we have with nursing homes and
prisons and have you thought about
separating those cases
out on the dashboard so that people can
see how just how many cases are coming
from our universities
um i don't think that would be a good
idea
uh i i think that you know if you're
talking about
prisons then uh
you know there's always a relevance to
the community even with prisons because
you have people
from the community who are bringing it
in and then people who who are going
who work there who may be taking it out
too so there's a relevance to the
community
but a prison is a static population not
static they come in and out but it's
because they're released but most of the
people are there
uh and not mingling into that into that
community
but when you talk about the college um
you know students at miami university
students at
ou the students at ohio state bowling
green kent state
you know they're in those communities uh
they're uptown
uh you know they may work someplace
there
they many of them don't even live on
campus they live
out in the community so i think it would
be a mistake um
you know it's interesting i think you
know we try to kind of figure out
okay why why are our numbers up i mean
we've seen
our positivity numbers go up in the last
eight nine days
we don't like that why are they why are
they going up
why are the cases remaining high over
1400 today
you know that's not good we try to at
least understand it and drill down and
figure it
out but even then
it's not particularly easy you know you
you basically
could take the number put out by the
school and then you could you know
see those numbers are showing up in your
numbers so you know
that those are separate and anybody
could do that i mean anybody
picking up the paper and dayton can
figure out what ud is doing ohio state
they can
figure out in columbus and uh you know
on and on
but to separate them would indicate
they're not part of the community and i
think that would be a mistake
because they are part of the community
next question is from jeff redick at
wsyx in columbus
thanks governor to piggyback on that
question
uh and with respect to anan shah spoke
earlier it seemed to be a bit of a real
picture um for ohio state university
which
at last report was nearing a six percent
positivity rate
uh and knowing that that's a source of
cases in the community
how long would it be before your
administration is driven to act
beyond what the university might do
well we're certainly i had the
opportunity to uh
talk with a new president who
um i think starts officially today um
or yesterday a new president we talked a
nice conversation over the weekend
just about that frankly about you know
the rise in positivity
if i remember correctly when the
students came back
it was about six tenths of one percent
so a little bit a little above one half
of one percent positivity
just as they were coming in uh we've
seen that number go up
um and as you see that number go up it's
you know just like we see any numbers go
up that's not good
so if that positivity number keeps going
up obviously something's going to have
to be done
but you know the college presidents
are very much on top of this i can tell
you ohio state says
ud's is miami's is bowling green i could
go through
because i've been talking to a lot of
them and they're all over this
so i'm not sure it's going to be my
decision it's probably initially
probably going to be a decision made by
that school
but let's let's you know let's hope uh
let's hope that
um students at ohio state students at
every other university in the state or
college in the state
uh recognize that their ability to stay
on campus their ability to stay in class
is solely
within collectively within their own
hands
they really control that and the school
can do everything that it can do
again just like our k-12 schools our
colleges and universities i've spent a
significant amount of money
and time um you know i have every
confidence that these kids are as safe
as they could be
or adults in class uh
in the library uh even in usually in a
dorm uh
but it is what students do other times
and uh you know it's what they do that
can simply can't be controlled by the
by the university and uh you know we all
remember when we were that age and
what we did and you know people like to
party they like to get together that's
part of the college
experience but doing it with a mask
is just vitally important today doing it
with social distancing is vitally
important doing it outside
if you can do it outside you know so
much safer
outside and again i would say to our
k-12 anytime you can have those kids
outside
uh where you think it's safe outside
it's not a storm or something
you know if you can get them outside
that is going to be a safer environment
than inside
just by definition and we've learned
that
so very very much in the last in the
last few months so
these college presidents are on this
they're focused on it
uh they're watching the numbers and
they're doing what what they can
governor your next question is your last
question and it belongs to
max philby of the columbus dispatch
hey governor um given your concern about
labor day weekend and the fact that
cases rose over july 4th weekend
and also the fact that we've got a
number of holidays coming up toward the
end of the year this year that are on
fridays saturdays that'll give us some
long weekends
have you given any thought to
implementing any sort of coveted
restrictions
limited limited to holiday weekends and
why or why not
max i thought about a lot of different
things and frankly i continue to think
about you know what else can we do uh
what else can we do and we're seeing the
positivity go up
uh what else can we do we know colleges
are coming back they're in
there's a lot of mixing just naturally
the same thing with k k-12
so yeah i think about things a lot i've
not made any decision to do that but
i've certainly thought about it
eric is telling me that we are done i
guess that's the last question
we will barring something unforeseen we
will see you all here
two o'clock on thursday thank you very
much
you
