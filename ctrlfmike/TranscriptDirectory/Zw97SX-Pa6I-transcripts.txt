good afternoon everyone
today i'm wearing a molar high school
tie our
grandson matthew went to moeller but
that's not why i'm wearing it today
i'm wearing a muller high school tie in
honor of
2020 more graduate michael kern
michael was a student at the university
of dayton he died over
the weekend michael was a starting point
guard on mueller's
26-1 basketball team last winter
and a member of the 2019 state
championship
team fran i offer our deepest sympathies
to the entire
current family and to all those who
lose children
fran i just came back from the funeral
for friend
beth bumgardner and just a personal
uh note uh best served uh worked for me
as a nurse analyst
at the medicare fraud unit of the
attorney general's office
also a long long friend for over 30
years
she was a nurse and truly took care of
people as
our nurses do so we'll miss beth very
much
i want to start today by talking about
rowan sweeney
he was a four-year-old he was an
innocent child
and his future full of infinite
possibilities
yesterday he was shot to death gunned
down
after someone walked into a home in
struthers
and opened fire police say the boy died
in his mother's arms
she was shot too along with three other
adults
what a horrible horrible senseless
tragedy
over the past two weeks we found reports
in the news media of at least 88 people
shot in ohio of those at least
34 were killed including another young
boy named
king pleasant picture of king
right there king was just six years old
he too had a future with
infinite possibilities until he was shot
to death
last week according to the canton
repository king was excited about first
grade
he loved the superhero black panther
the person accused of killing king is
also just a child 11 years old
now charged with juvenile reckless
homicide
authorities are investigating how the
child managed to get the deadly weapon
all of this is is just absolutely
heartbreaking
here are some recent headlines in
cleveland
ten-year-old boy hospitalized after
being shot in the back
reports say this young man was
critically injured
he was taking out the trash when he was
hit by a stray bullet
fired in a drive-by shooting in the
neighborhood in which he
lived here's another headline
23-year-old woman shot killed in akron
wednesday night
the next day two more people were shot
in a vigil held in the victim's honor
i've been doing this i've been doing
this every week
this time next week more will have died
which is why i will keep
talking about our legislation
that we have in front of the general
assembly and i would ask the general
assembly
to please take it up
and pass it most gun violence
that we are seeing is committed by
people who legally
cannot have a gun anyway already they
cannot have a gun
current law clearly is not tough enough
since these individuals continue to
illegally carry
and use weapons anyway our bill
that i'm asking the general assembly to
pass will toughen penalties for this
group of people who are breaking the law
by having a weapon the people who are
most likely
to use a gun to kill our
bill provides added penalties for these
individuals what we call weapons under
disability they're not allowed to have
the gun because they've committed a
felony
and we would enhance the penalty give
judges more discretion
about what to do with them when their
previous crime was a crime of violence
we have an obligation as leaders of this
state
to take action to protect people
this is an easy one this is not hard
we need to get it done
all right eric let's move to our data
slides
today we have 685
new cases report in ohio and again we
always get a little
uh concerned if the numbers are
accurate and they're accurate for the
what's been reported
but sometimes on the weekends things
just don't get reported as much
so uh we hope that this is a new trend
uh 685 cases we've been
hovering above a thousand cases we
certainly would like to see those
numbers go down
um this is in fact the lowest number of
cases reported since september 8. we'll
look and see tomorrow
about this time when we see the new
numbers for the next day and see if we
are really
in a good trend we are seeing a little
trend downward
we'll anxiously await tomorrow's numbers
we also have 12 deaths reported
yesterday
additionally there are 70 new
hospitalizations and 11 new icu
admissions
during the past 24 hours let's go to our
top 10 20 i guess we'll go to 20.
highest occurrence counties and again
we started doing this a month or so ago
just to show you
the number of cases in each county in
the last two weeks
uh based on 100 000 populations so we're
comparing apples to
two apples um what you'll see here and
i'll just go down you start with mercer
putnam shelby uh athens lawrence
miami butler delaware dark all glazed
wood
and on um so a heavy concentration
uh in the western side of the state uh
these are counties where
the positivity
is high but the number of new cases is
what actually
we are in fact measuring so
when you look at how your county is
doing that's a good chart to look at
the other one of course is is our one
that we unveil every thursday
which is the color
coded uh by county
let me go to another chart uh we update
this daily
at two o'clock we'll go to the next one
eric
yeah and what this shows is
number of cases run every day
and then uh it also shows on the chart
uh the positivity
and so this
positivity is displayed for that day
and a seven day running positivity is a
number that one of the numbers many
numbers we look at it's a significant
number
what we're seeing is um the good news is
that our seven-day moving average of
test is over 32 000 tests per day again
not where we want to be but it
continues to to go upward we are seeing
uh very good news a decline in
positivity we are today at a seven day
average of 2.9
2.9 and
a lot of what we're going to talk about
today is how we get ready
for winter a beautiful day outside in
ohio
and it's hard to think about winter but
it will be coming and the concern of
course
is as people move inside more we're in
more confined spaces
we see the spread of the virus so we
want to get our positivity number
obviously down as low as we can we're
certainly headed in the in the right
direction we hope to see it
get get even lower we're unveiling a new
um dashboard today uh
we've continued throughout this six
month period to try to
give you as much information as we can
so people can look at this
and policymakers whether in the
department of health or local health
departments
or the legislature governor's office can
make decisions
let me talk about this one there's a
coven 19 data dashboard called
case demographics and you're seeing one
page
displayed up there now by selecting this
specific tool
under demographics menu you can access
coven 19 case
data by race and break it down by age
and by county
and compare it to the overall ohio
population
improving data collection and reporting
as well as creating a
publicly available dashboard were
recommendations from our covet
19 minority health strike force so we're
glad to
comply with their request and it's good
it's a good thing to have
this dashboard helps better track health
inequities
and disparities and this data can help
put critical decisions into context
for policy makers again this data will
be available today on the covet
19 data dashboard at
coronavirus.ohio.gov
with the election coming up i want to uh
brief you on a voter registration issue
which arose recently
and has since been remedied but i want
to
talk a little bit about it our ohio
benefits
system provides online services
for ohioans who receive benefits through
programs
within ohio medicaid and the ohio
department of job and family services
ohio benefits offers users
an opportunity to receive a voter
registration
form at their request there's a place
where they can
my understanding a place where they can
actually click that if they want that
the department of administrative
services recently became aware
that due to a system error some ohioans
who asked to receive a voter
registration form
at that particular time did not
get sent a form approximately 59
000 ohioans were affected by the error a
review of affected individuals
determined
that of this group approximately 18 900
were already registered to vote and an
additional
7 500 received voter registration forms
from ohio benefits to other
separate transactions that left 32
400 who had not received a form at the
time
of this review um a week ago monday
das sent voter registration forms to all
59 000 individuals so i want to thank
des for identifying this issue and
getting it fixed so that went out uh
eight days ago
seven or eight days ago to those 59
000 individuals who had clicked
something on a benefits
that they indicated that they wanted an
application
we've been uh bringing in
superintendents um
they're doing a phenomenal job and i
again want to thank all our
superintendents our
teachers our school staff educational
service centers
for working so very very hard to keep
our kids safe
and to continue to teach our children
this certainly is
no ordinary time and
i just want to thank each and every one
of you for going that extra mile and
doing those things to
educate our children as we have
been doing since the start of the year
we're inviting superintendents and
joining us today
is jeffrey ramnet's superintendent with
barberton
city schools mr superintendent thank you
for
joining us thank you very much for
having me governor i really appreciate
it
well is it is it a is it a pretty day in
barberton today
oh the sun's always shining in barbecue
especially when the magics take the
field so we're excited about that
well that that's good i missed the
parade this year the parade's always fun
i know we do miss that and the pancake
breakfast as well so yeah
well next year hopefully we won't have
masks on when we see you there
we we hope to be there we hope you'll be
there
well let me tell you a little bit about
your school district and um
for people who don't know barberton tell
me about the district
and then kind of tell us how you you're
breaking this out you've got some kids
online you've got other kids
who are in the classroom you prepared
for it this summer
just kind of bring us up to date what's
going on in barberton
uh barbara city school district we serve
about 3 800 students
we are a very hard-working blue-collar
town
our parents work hard the city the city
people work hard
our teachers work extremely hard we do
have challenges
we're on about 72 percent free and
reduced
uh we have about 20 percent students who
are on special needs
um but we we love it we love taking care
of our students and uh our motto is
we meet each child where they're at and
we work with them to grow them
uh year to year till they we get them on
one of the three e's which is enrolled
enlisted or employed
so we're very very proud of the things
in the programming that we have here in
barberton
our plan was very important to us for
many reasons
i know in the spring everybody had a
pretty tough time
uh parents uh they developed a greater
appreciation for what teachers do
um so we listened to our tea we listened
to our parents we met with parent groups
we did surveys and really i would say
three-fourths of our parents
wanted our students to come back into
school and
we also had we heard from parents that
uh felt that they
didn't feel comfortable letting their
parent their students go back into
school
so we looked at our resources uh luckily
we had uh passed a few
renewal levies uh just recently and we
looked at our resources we looked at our
staffing
and initially we were talking about
maybe bringing in the younger students
but as we looked at that we we felt we
need our students in front of us
it's been about 22 weeks that they had
been gone uh
from spring even though we were working
in the spring it's still not
uh being in front of our teachers and
face-to-face instruction
so we felt that we with our resources
with our teachers
and our buildings and our in the space
and our abilities that we could bring
uh our students in so we did put out and
we gave our parents a choice which they
wanted
and i was very proud that we were able
to give them a choice
um about 1200 students chose remote
and we have about 2 600 students that
chose in-school
instruction which actually made it a
little bit nicer we have about
15 or less in each classroom our
students are doing a great job i just i
have to say what a great job and how
proud i am
of not only our students our staff our
parents
and our community our students are doing
an amazing job one of the big things was
they they were worried a lot of the
parents were worried that they couldn't
wear masks
all day long um i will tell you we have
a we started barbington preschool here
about two or three years ago
and our three wearing those masks every
day and they know
they know the six foot distance as well
uh but our
our preschool all the way up to seniors
are doing a great job wearing those
masks
they're doing what is necessary for us
to stay open and we're very proud about
that
the process was amazing we did we did a
lot of uh
planning and preparation in the summer
because we didn't realize or know
which pathway we would take and have to
deliver instruction
so there was a lot of professional
development on the remote part
but luckily we have those people trained
and our remote is going very well too
it's a lot more structured
it's it's the same as a school day they
have periods they check in with their
teachers
and we we actually had meetings with our
teachers and our parents that went
remote
because we felt it was important to get
that personal connection
uh before they start uh because it's
very important barbed and
and i would say most school systems that
personal connection
is extremely important but we understand
that we have to move our students
forward
no matter if they're remote or if
they're in school
and our staff is doing an amazing job
with that
that is great uh one of the things you
and i talked about uh
the other day um in regard to
uh what students do when they're not in
in school
uh one things that we we have seen one
of the
challenges for college students and for
adults and all of us is
you know when we're not into that
routine then
you know what do we do
how's that working out for you and your
messaging to the
students it's it's so far so good we've
had a few bumps in the roads but i have
to say
summer county health department and
tanya burford who i have on speed dial
she's been amazing she's been amazing
and
anytime that there isn't any type of
issues we call her up she helps us
through the process
she's been great and probably most
superintendents with summit county would
say that
but we've really encouraged our parents
they've asked us for the choice
they've asked us to start sports up
this is a big sports town they we're
extremely happy that our magics are out
there
competing so we're asking them to
to stay focused and stick with the plan
and listen to
what the governor's saying and don't go
in large groups
and and be smart because we really truly
want we need to stay open
our students need to be in front of our
teachers again whether it's in school or
remote
and and how about your remote students
uh are you doing this with your own
teachers is that how you're
you're doing that absolutely uh again
our teachers
we didn't know which pathway we would be
taking
come fall so all of our teachers were
training in the summer
but really truly what was nice is we
were actually able to use our teachers
that had concerns about coming back as
well
as our instructors and yes it is barbara
and teachers
marvin and curriculum um and they're
doing a great job
uh we had a little little bump in the
road at the beginning but it's getting
better every day
the communication is amazing we're and
we're really we're trying to
we're also and we appreciate the social
emotional support that the state has
given us
we're trying to incorporate those things
as well remotely
and in person because those wrap around
services
was one of the big things that we were
worried about with our students being
gone from us
for so long for about 22 weeks
well that that's great one last question
for your remote students who
are in let's say lower elementary school
how did how does that
how does that work are these kids able
to
do it does it work oh absolutely yes
they're doing an amazing job
um our teacher but we're a one-to-one
district or we have chromebooks
and we had this beforehand again because
of the great support of our community
so those students have taken those
chromebooks home even our in-school
students take those chromebooks home but
yes our young ones are doing a great job
we're checking in frequently
sometimes if we have to go knock on a
door and see what's going on there or
making sure that they're logging in
we're doing those things as well
but we are actually trying to start
remote tutoring
uh because sometimes there may not be a
parent or a guardian there
while they're working but in the evening
when that parent or guardian comes home
we'll have that remote tutor
available for those students who need
that as well
oh that's that's interesting yeah that's
exciting
yes it is great well good luck to you
and your students and your faculty and
everybody at barberton and
we wish you a great year thank you very
much governor
we appreciate it thank you very much
since we began reopening ohio after the
initial state home order we've listened
to experts
who've told us that being outside is
better when you can be outside
that combined with mask wearing social
distancing
proper hygiene certainly helps us slow
down
covet 19. we've seen ohioans following
the expert advice but we also know that
colder months are coming and so
we thought we'd bring an expert in
joining us today is ohio state
university environmental engineer dr
mark
weir he is the co-director of the
ecology
epidemiology and population health
program at osu infectious disease
institute doctor thank you very very
much for joining us
thanks for having me we we appreciate it
very much
you know we've heard a lot over the last
few days
about aerosolized particles and droplets
and how coca-19 spreads uh on the news
this morning about that and i wonder if
you could maybe just give us a
a one-on-one class that about how that
works
of course um so aerosols in general at
first sound kind of scary
um especially when somebody's talking
about airborne
if somebody says the word airborne
people start to react to that so
um one thing i did i put together a
couple slides that might be able to help
okay we'll look at those sure yeah so if
you go to the first one after the title
um every time that you cough um if
you're
coughing or if you're sneezing you're
obviously expiring out
or expelling out uh droplets and other
particles and those finer smaller
particles that don't drop
out within the the three to six feet
range that we've heard about so much
are the aerosols and so the top image of
those three bars
is the very small particles and they're
going farther afield
and it all depends on the shape of your
mouth when you're talking
how forcefully you're talking how
quietly you're talking
how much you're coughing type of
coughing that you're doing things like
that there's a lot that goes into it but
this happens all the time
and so it's something that we deal with
on the consistent basis so if you look
at the next slide
we have models that we've been putting
together that have been trying to look
at well what are the overall
building and room risks associated with
people
speaking singing talking coughing
sneezing
when they have stars cove 2 or kova 19
or
something else so we built these kind of
models for influenza
mers cove stars so the first sars that
came around
um to be able to try and understand
these every virus is a little different
and
how it forms itself as a or how many
viruses are in those aerosols because
just because it's an aerosol doesn't
mean it's a virus and just because it
has aerosolized a particle that came out
from your mouth
doesn't mean that there's viruses in
those aerosols and so
what you're looking at is a simulation
that we put together with a
great colleague down in south carolina
and dr hope put these together as a way
of being able to say well as we are
increasing our control
such as air exchange rates filtration of
the room
um mixture of air from the outside so
make up air is what we call that what is
actually going to be doing by way of
removing the particles and
it depends on what you can run and how
you can operate it but you can have a
fairly good margin of safety
being able to control the air assault so
you go on last slide
this is really similar to what we've
been talking about this entire time
with regards to the different barriers
and the different levels of control
and so it's basically between the virus
and you are a series of walls that you
can put in place or a series of barriers
that you can put in place
we already know about face masks hand
washing and social distancing
now we're talking about when we're
talking about aerosols
there's engineering options for us at
this point to be able to work through so
while aerosols are a new thing for
for uh for us to be talking about with
regards to source cove too
it is a known quantity from
with regards to ideas of how to control
it
knowledge and technology that we have to
be able to try and control it
now it's at this stage here of
optimizing or or
finessing those controls so that they
can be as effective as possible for this
particular pathogen
and and doctor so so we can understand
uh eric if you go back to the last
actually back two slides
you've got before cough and three
minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes
just make sure i understand this and our
viewers can understand it you've got
something on here that is red you've got
something that's blue what's the
difference and how big a room is it
so that is an average size shared office
space the way we built that one out so
um we didn't put in the cubicle walls
just yet we were just putting in the the
air flows the stocks and flows and
everything
the red is somebody who has a soros cove
to infection
so what you'll end up seeing is that how
that kind of mixes in the environment
but it doesn't end up contaminating the
entire room how
the air flows through the room dictates
where it's going to be able to deposit
on surfaces
who's going to be able to inhale it
later on and where it's going to go into
the
the ventilation system itself okay
we know outside is generally better than
inside
uh and you want to just tell us why that
is maybe it's obvious but
uh just tell us anyway there's i mean
there's a couple pieces to it
um one is that you'll get
much more dynamic air flows when you're
outside so
um deposition and fallout from the
aerosol so that how the aerosols fall
out of the air
typically can occur quite quicker it'll
disperse out into a wider area there's
just
more space for it to be able to go
somewhere there's a
an old wrong saying when you're talking
about pollution which is the solution to
pollution is dilution
while that's not correct for how you
handle environmental pollution
in this case the solution is dilution
where dilution means you take
the same amount of something but put
into a bigger volume and now
you have less ability for you to be able
to inhale it
so that is that is one of the solutions
then it is
and and outdoors is is where you're
going to be able to get the absolute
largest volume
plus you have all the other dynamics of
things like uv exposure
um you just being able to move around in
a in a
larger more basic more random kind of
pattern as well
and and what we tried to do we're
talking about on the indoor side of
things
we've tried to mimic that where we can't
bringing in as much fresh air from the
outdoors removing as much air from
indoors
as possible and so on uh just just so
i'm following here you want to tell me
about
droplets as opposed to the air sliced
particles
what's what's what's what's the
difference if there is a difference
yep so the difference is size
so anything that is within droplet size
range so
about um four microns and up so very
very small particles yeah we're still
talking about very small particles
but they're heavy enough and large
enough that within about
three feet to six feet range is where
they really start to slope down you can
actually see the trajectory going
out and sloping down and they just end
up hitting people's pants or the floor
or somewhere else okay so i'm speaking
right now what would i expect to happen
so you might expect predominantly you
would end up seeing mostly droplets
coming out and then they would fall down
so if you had
a special type of camera that could
actually track the particles coming out
you'd see a bulk of them being droplets
and then you would have a mist of
aerosols that would be able to come out
and
if you are up and projecting your voice
they'll come up a little bit more of an
angle and have a specific cone of
expansion from there okay now
we've read or we've heard this kind of
controversy cdc put
something up on then they take it down
let's put that aside for a moment but
but
what is it that we actually do know what
let's start with what
we know at this point i mean you know
we've continued
to learn scientists have continued to
learn throughout this
let's start with what we what we what we
do know and then what we may think
however you want to explain it
so what we do know is that the virus has
to be able to get to
essentially the back of your throat into
what we call the nasopharyngeal region
so that's where it has to start to
deposit it has to be able to deposit in
the upper respiratory tract
up in that upper portion of your
respiratory system so not your mouth but
back back
where the wind is starting to go in it
goes down into your lungs
that's where it needs to deposit so it
needs to land on that surface
and then it needs to be able to infect
cells that are that make up that portion
of your respiratory system
so we know that now how that gets
delivered
is where the question ends up residing
where
when we were talking about surfaces so
at first surfaces were a
massively dominant component of
transmission so when we say transmission
we mean that the virus has to go from
somewhere in the environment that's
somewhere into you
and the surfaces where
you would touch the surface and then you
would touch your nose or touch your eye
and then you'll be able to get into the
mucous system
and make its way to where it needs to be
that ended up being downgraded in a
level of importance the more we learned
about the droplet spread
the droplet spread is where that three
to six foot range comes in
predominantly three feet and that's
where you're more likely to be able to
get those larger particles actually hit
your face
you can respire those particles um
or they'll be a much more contaminated
area in front of you to drive
surface risks now aerosols are
you're beyond six feet you're beyond
into about 10 feet or so out
and you can still inhale those particles
now what we're talking about is if the
majority of them that come out are
droplets that means that a smaller
amount are going to be aerosols
and it still takes a fairly good amount
of virus for you to be able to inhale
and actually become
sick so we're now we're in that range of
how much is enough to make you sick
when we're talking about aerosols so
that's where a lot of the the back and
forth
and the discussion and research has been
on is how
important are aerosols in exposure we
we've known for a little while that
aerosols are a component but
how important those aerosols are is the
question and that's where cdc
had put something up and then took it
back down for
you'd have to have cdc reasons but um
you know having having worked at epa
you know you want to make sure
everything is right
down to the you know exact thoughts on
eyes and everything else so that could
be what it is as well
so as we look at this
as we head towards the winter and we
look at
public buildings we look at schools we
look at businesses we look at houses
you know what should we be thinking
about
and what are some of the things that we
can do
to deal with it i mean if you talk about
you talked about the droplets
that would seem from what you said to be
basically a function of distance
uh would that be right yes the the
aerosized particles
that's different uh it would seem to be
would that be a matter of circulation uh
based on what would be the variables
there exactly
circulation is one of the key ones and
the first and foremost is to find out
what kind of control you have
over a ventilation system in your home
business
or elsewhere one key very important
thing is that air conditioning and
heating
are not the same as ventilation
ventilation is just focused on moving
the air around
what energy you put in to either heat it
or remove
nor to cool it is the air conditioning
or the heating component
so you may have an ac system it doesn't
mean that you have a ventilation system
so that's one key thing to think about
first
circulation is a great way to think of
it you're moving the air
and it's it's a component of of three
big pieces there's
the air exchange rates how often can you
take all the air in the room and remove
it and replace it with fresh
the makeup air that we call that makeup
bear in
engineering and industrial hygiene is
how much of the outdoor air can i bring
in
that's absolutely fresh doesn't have
source code 2 in it
and then the other one is filtration and
they all work together
and so it is not really so much a
component of
getting as much air out as possible as
often as possible that will have
a beneficial effect but you really need
to look at all three of those
pieces working together for you to be
able to find uh
okay okay i wrote down two i missed one
so you've got
you've got filtration you've got air
exchange ratio
what's the third one um makeup air
so that amount of outdoor air to bring
in okay
you want to go through those quickly for
me sure so the
the makeup bear is where you're talking
about where you don't have the virus
it's outdoor air um so even if there is
a
small amount of virus that's in the
outdoor air is
much much smaller than what would be in
the indoor air and it's typically zero
or at least lower than we can detect it
so that air being brought in is fresh
it's clean you can filter it so be so it
becomes cleaner so you remove allergens
and any other kind of chemicals that are
in it
before it comes into the building and
then you circulate that through the
building then you have to you typically
have to recirculate some of the air for
energy efficiency
reasons as well as humidity controls and
things like that
and that's where air exchange rates come
in as well as filtration they kind of
work hand in hand and that
you can remove a lot of the air and
replace it back into the room
but if you're not filtering it you're
you're just circulating
air from from within the room to another
room or within the same room
and so you know the air exchange rates
is where
think of it where you have the volume of
room that you are in so height
by high times area is your volume take
all of that volume remove it within an
hour
how many times can you do that is your
air changes per hour or your air
exchange rate
and then the filtration is just
filtration so if you've ever seen an
hvac filter
what you're basically doing is just
pushing air through very very small
holes
and it's going to remove the bioaerosols
some of them are small enough to be able
to remove viruses but the majority of
places can remove the bio-aerosols
predominantly that are harboring the
virus
so for our viewers out there let's say
they own a house
let's say it's a 20 year old house
what is from a practical point of view
let's see
let's say that uh you know people are in
and out or let's
even say it's a business let's assume
it's a business and
it's a retail business so they have
people coming in and out
every every single day
what should they do how do they get on
top of this if they want to try to do
something to
improve the situation so
if their business they have a great
opportunity to be able to control the
air in their building
if they have that if they have the
technology bill to do that and
can you know have a very impactful uh
benefit on limiting spread by by
improving the air inside their buildings
um what they want to do is they want to
talk to
whomever it is that they work with as
their licensed
hvac technician or engineer so whoever
they have that comes out that's licensed
that is able to do the maintenance and
operation
updates and preventative maintenance on
their system
have them come out and survey it make
sure they know
what they can actually operate and then
what they can do is work with them and
say well how high of an air change rate
can i have
through what size filter and how much
outdoor air can i bring in
and still be able to operate within a
profitable scheme because you don't want
to go out of business
operating something that's just too
costly so sit down with them make sure
that you have a good plan of how you're
going to be able to go forward with that
the cdc has a great table for clinical
settings but it still works for
other indoor spaces on a number
on different air change rates to be able
to use
so you can always refer to that if you
want
and i'd have to sit down with them make
sure that they are
appropriately licensed and able to be
able to help you with that
and they recommend to talk to a
ventilation engineer see if that works
within your budget and then talk with
them
doctor we're gonna with your help we
hope uh put something up
uh on our web page uh in a short while
uh maybe to give people some better
information but until we get that up
again
what's the best place for them to look
let's say they
they've got a shop or they've got a
house and they want to
go look up what they really need to do
so that they can
intelligently talk to their heating
expert or their
and their air conditioning expert so
great way to start um by taking a dive
into
indoor air is to go to the epa's website
and look for indoor air quality
and that's going to give you a bit of a
crash course into indoor air quality
it's going to be
focused around carbon dioxide build up
for how many you know by respirat was
perspiring how are you contaminating the
room as well as
anything that's volatilizing or um
you know chemicals are coming off of the
desk surfaces and things like that
that's what that page is mostly focused
on
there's a great crash course into what
indoor air quality is
precise definitions of error change air
exchange rate so if
i'm not being clear then you can go
there and they have a great resource
there
from there what you can do is you can
refer to cdc websites now
some of those are clinically oriented
and i think that's one of the things
that we'll be working with you on
making sure that we have a translate you
know translation make sure we understand
how things are moving forward
let's start with the epa and then from
the epa website
contact your hvac license technician
doctor thank you very much we will be uh
we'll be back in touch with you but we
appreciate you coming on today and
giving us a introductory course
thank you thank you
let's move now to learn a little bit
more about
contact tracing we have a contact
tracer who we're going to bring in here
in a moment um
let's let's let's actually go to mitch
mitch you on there
yes hi governor happy to be here mitch
uh
dan duran is the epidemiologist at
lorraine county health department
has been working there for four years i
believe
and uh you're getting a workout in the
last
six months or so it's a little different
world but
can you just for somebody who's watching
this today who has no idea what you do
can you kind of take them through the
process
uh from the beginning you know and then
just kind of
information comes in from the time it
maybe comes into the health department
you take it and you go from there
absolutely
absolutely um yeah certainly did not
expect a pandemic within my first couple
years of
working in a local health department but
you know kent state
got my mindset right and i'm ready for
anything coming out of there so
i can attribute that to them as for
contact tracing
it's pretty straightforward process we
get a notification of a confirmed lab
and our first course of action is to
identify
how we can reach that person a lot of
times that's reported by the lab
and that's a simple phone call and first
and foremost when they do answer the
phone
you want to make sure that they're
medically fit to complete an interview
you don't want to exacerbate
somebody that's already extremely sick
so
some cases have mild symptoms other have
very severe symptoms so we kind of use
our best judgment
to see if that person is medically fit
to to give up the information that we
need
and then from there once they say you
know i'm good we can do this
we are very straightforward with how
what we intend to do with this interview
what we intend to do with the
information that they give us that way
they have it
in their head throughout the interview
of this is why i need to answer these
questions in
a forthcoming manner so once that's all
established
we go right into establishing a time
frame
for this individual in which they were
infectious so
how we do that is we asked when they
first started to feel ill
and what those symptoms were and once we
get that
that date of symptom onset we can
establish
that infectious period and once we have
that time frame we
reiterate to them so okay so we're going
since
september 2nd keep that that that date
in your mind
and as we move forward with this
interview we're going to try to identify
anyone you
exposed and then we go over the
definition of exposure that's very
important
to know what we're looking for them to
know what we're looking for
so once that time frame is established
once that definition is clear in their
head
we move right into it on trying to
figure out
who they may have exposed we start with
the household contacts that's pretty
straightforward
workplace contacts you know when was
your last day at work what did that last
day work look like
is your employer aware do you have any
other cases at work
and then we move on to the community
exposures
those that they may have exposed in a
more casual setting
whether it be through a lunch a family
gathering
churches anything like that so we got
those
three levels of which they could have
exposed anybody um
and then we kind of follow follow up
that interview with a two-week history
this is the more complicated part but um
you know this helps us establish links
with any outbreaks that may be going on
establish a link with a known case that
we have on file
really helps the health department learn
how this is being transmitted throughout
the community
but basically what we tell them when you
say you know when you're going to give
us some information here's exactly what
we're going to do with that information
so those people that come up as
exposures are actually forwarded
down to a different team of ours we have
the interview team that gets that
information and then we have another
team that
reaches out to those that were exposed
and informs of
of their exposure remaining
confidentiality
very important for the case but also it
gives these people a time frame of what
they should be looking at
and the people making these calls to
those that expose
have been are tried and true
professionals they have been
on the front lines of kovitz since march
so
they're experienced with this pandemic
as anybody else in ohio at this point
so we have a really great professional
reaching out to you and letting you know
of all these steps that you should be
taking
for how long and this is what you should
do to protect your family your community
in your workplace
if they want to sign up for a system
where they report
symptoms to us that's easily done
through a text messaging system
developed by the state health department
if
you know that really helps with data
collection it helps us determine on when
it's safe for them to return to work
whether or not they should be tested
so it helps get some information on on
that individual and we can just
consult and guide from there so that's
kind of how the process
works yeah yeah so when you're talking
let's go back to you when you're talking
to the person that
uh has tested positive um and you're now
trying to determine
you know who might they have infected
what's what are some of the variables
the criteria i i mean
um length and time
they're with somebody and i mean how do
you just maybe give us a couple of
examples of
maybe an example of where you you assume
it's not an
infection or and then maybe where you
would assume it was and pass that name
then on
to the next person on your team
absolutely our interviewers are very
experienced
we try to say you know you got to get
the details the details the details on
all of these exposure settings
so that's exactly right the length of
time whether or not there's a mask worn
any direct contact so when we tell them
this is what we're looking for we're
looking for
relative to your symptom onset date so
we got your symptom on set date
let's go three days prior to that that's
when we what we call the pre-symptomatic
phase
and people are spreading it
pre-symptomatically they don't know they
have it
so we're going to go three days from
your symptom onset we're going to define
close contact as
anyone within six feet of you for
15 minutes or longer and then we're
going to get some context behind that
interaction were you
there all day did you make direct
contact did you have a mask and that way
you know if we get in those situations
we're not sure the degree of exposure
the team can talk about it the team can
reach out to the individual
get their side of the story but yeah
basically the definition of close
contact is that six feet
um within that time frame um
with or without a mask so it's it's just
a lot of details behind the exposure
that we we collect and we look at
so every case is kind of fact specific i
guess
exactly and that's why it's tough to
come up with some written protocol
some very black and white directions
we've tried that since the start and
as soon as we do it a case comes and
blows the whole thing to pieces
so that's just kind of the nature of it
you got to be
quick on your feet and
have a team that's willing to consult
with you and and really go over the
information together
and uh the the factor explain to me
uh as a as a professional who's done
this now an awful lot of times
uh explain to me the factor of time
how how long your it might be exposed to
somebody how does that
factor in and what are some of the other
factors
so we use that we use that contact
definition
that was from the state so that that
factor of time now if someone's with
someone all day intermittently it's
really tough to say
cumulatively were you exposed for 15
minutes were you
there for 15 minutes within six feet so
again it's all about those details and
you know what we find is
those that spent the day together and
and try to cut their distance and
everything you know we might not see
really a high-risk situation there but
you know spending someone spending time
in someone's household that's a
different type of
exposure especially if the case lived
there
so those are all the factors that
contribute to that time frame we look at
okay well mitch thank you very very much
good luck
to you and and everyone who else is out
there that's
that's engaged in this we appreciate
your work we know it's not easy
and thanks for doing it good luck
thank you governor thank you appreciate
it
lieutenant governor on lieutenant
governor's on
i am governor i uh got a mask today from
wright state university they
sent some along we always appreciate
what our colleges and universities are
doing to help us with workforce and also
trying to do it safely so
welcome those welcome those
relationships
let me talk a little bit today about
some of our employers in the state
and the economic recovery and how some
of these employers are really helping us
protect
lives and livelihoods and live with the
coronavirus in our lives and
and move forward economically i'm going
to start with one of our larger
employers
the the ford motor company we all know
ford
they employ 6 000 people in the state of
ohio
but we're announcing a donation that
they made
of 2 million medical grade face masks
to ohio this is part of their ongoing
commitment
to provide a hundred
million medical grade masks through 2021
they are currently manufacturing 2.5
million
medical grade masks a week for its
employees in at-risk communities
and is growing they're growing and the
number of masks that they're producing
every week so they can reach that goal
and we we
very much appreciate their donation to
ohio and
and all the people that they employ here
and how they're helping us
get through the virus grow jobs and keep
people safe
next i want to move on to national small
business week
we've uh national small business week is
uh this week
20 the 22nd to the 24th is the the days
that we're focused on there are
965 000 small businesses in our state
they employ 2.2 million people
that's 45 of the total employees in the
state
in 2019 they created
44 000 jobs and
firms with fewer than 20 employees uh
had the largest gains of 29 132
and i'm sure a lot of people might be
interested to know that the segments of
the small business community that are
growing the fastest
are women-owned and minority-owned
businesses
but our development services agency
provides
support for small business development
centers
and the u.s small business
administration recognizes individuals
and business owners
for their contributions to our economy
and uh and they like to recognize those
small business development centers that
that really have done
an amazing job and we're proud to
announce this week that
the ohio spdc in springfield was
recognized by the sba
as the great lakes region small business
development center
excellence and innovation award winner
this year and
there are only 10 small business
development centers of nearly a thousand
across the nation to earn this
distinction
and for ohio's for the sake of ohio
this is the fourth year in a row that in
ohio sbdc has been named
best in the midwest by the sba so
they're doing a great job and you can
see that by some of the results
of the businesses that they help i want
to focus on one today
that's an sbdc c client karilla fire
which was named by the sba as the great
lakes
region small business exporter of the
year and what carillo fire
training facilities which are located in
fowler ohio
does is they they cover a variety of
activities from design manufacture
construction modification repair
maintenance of
of an inspection of firefighter training
facilities
the big deal about this is that yes they
were doing it in ohio
yes they're creating jobs in ohio they
were providing these services
across the united states but working
with the sbdc
they are now exporting to 15 countries
so this is how
you can have a small business working in
partnership with people that can knock
down those barriers
and um and help them export uh to the
rest of the world and and grow business
and
and um i mentioned small business week
because i was on the phone today earlier
with roger geiger from
from the national federation for
independent business and
and we were talking um during covid
the people who are taking it on the chin
uh toughest sometimes are those small
businesses because
they don't have enough much of an online
presence people need to go out
and we just want to use this week as a
reminder
you know go out when you when you need
to buy
something whether that's uh you name it
try to try to focus on a local small
business owner
because they they are people that live
in your community
typically a hundred percent of that that
money gets circulated inside of your
community employing people um supporting
families helping
helping support that that
that community and so we just encourage
folks to use your
locally owned small businesses whether
their mom or
mom and pops family owned stores they
need your help
and we're doing all we can to support
them
and i guess i'll conclude by governor
saying this the businesses in this state
have really stepped up from the big ones
to the small ones
to to help us drive drive forward
during this difficult time and we thank
them they've been
they've been outstanding and and we need
to support them because they're
supporting us
so we do indeed we do indeed thank you
very much
time for questions governor first
question today is from jeff redick
at wsyx in columbus
afternoon to you governor uh question
for both you and the lieutenant governor
today i understand that you'd face
some pressure to join the president in
ohio um yesterday's event however
vandalia where you were was unlike
anything that we'd seen for months of
course you both attended and that event
seemed to break all the guidance that
you've given ohioans
for months lieutenant governor houston
he was encouraging a mostly masculist
crowd to cheer taboo
breathing a lot of those aerosols and
droplets that we just heard about into a
partially indoor setting so given all
the prior
guidance to this um is there a defense
or a reason for it
well i'll i'll start um look we've made
it very clear
that if you're exercising your first
amendment rights
we're not going to have a health order
um
that prohibits you from exercising your
first amendment rights we said the same
thing to demonstrators
demonstrators on anything demonstrators
who demonstrated against the health
director
dr acton demonstrators who demonstrate
against me
demonstrators who came out out to our
house and
went by and honk their horns and do
their things
look so but we've also said been very
very clear
whether it's demonstrators whether it's
people at a trump rally or people at any
other political rally
you know please wear a mask uh that is
how you stay safe that is how you slow
this spread down
um we have been consistent uh about this
mask of guidance that we have given
and so you know they did not follow that
uh some did uh many did not uh
and i think that's that's too bad that
they they did not do that
but our you know we're gonna be
consistent uh in regard to the first
amendment uh we did the same thing with
churches
uh you know we've said people need to
wear a mask in church but we've
we never the height of this ever shut
our churches down
many churches pulled back and said we're
going to be remote
we're going to do that but we never
unlike other states we've never issued
an order that
closed the churches we've not in any way
really prohibited the first amendment
exercise
but we have asked people please please
be careful sometimes they listen to us
sometimes they don't
yeah uh look during the during the whole
process
uh i mean much to my own peril
i tried to encourage people to to wear
masks
uh i held up masks uh encouraged people
to do it when they went out
and i wore a mask at the event other
than when i was speaking which was
outside and
and i was very very much distance from
anybody in
in the crowd but we've been very
consistent about it and
like i said you know folks uh
folks want to wear their trump masks
they want to wear their biden masks that
they can wear whatever mask they want
but they should they should do it
because it works and
and uh we're seeing the results i mean
look the people of this state have been
pretty good
all all around during this and now we're
seeing
during a difficult time when schools
went back when colleges have gone back
when
sports are going on that if you follow
the rules outside of those settings
with masks and distancing that can work
and we see the positivity rate
down to below three percent now which is
which is great news
uh the people of this state are making
this work
uh it's it's not perfect yesterday
certainly wasn't
but by and large people of ohio getting
it right and
you know i tried to set a good example
um in what i did
i do a health call with a call
uh in the morning once a week with our
health directors around the state and um
it's it's fascinating because they kind
of give me a report
and we went through a number of them i
think we had 120 on
uh this morning something like that from
different different counties different
departments
and the report as far as what mask
wearing was good
uh there are a couple outliers a couple
ones who said no we're only at 50.
um but the majority of the people who
talked today
on the call said hey we're doing better
it continues to edge up
um so look ohioans i think by and large
are doing very very well
and we're that's made a difference i
mean this positivity would not be what
it is today
um you know we would not have slowed
this this increase
uh and going down really to a plateau
and maybe a little bit down a number of
cases
uh without people wearing masks it has
made a fundamental difference
and so while we look at sometimes when
there's examples of people not doing it
we should also look at
all the other examples that people are
are doing it or fran and i were today at
church funeral service
a lot of people there everybody had had
a mask on everyone was trying to
distance
people were being very very careful and
that matters
next question is from emily hamilton at
wews
in cleveland
hi governor and lieutenant governor uh
emily hamilton with news 5 here
for nearly two weeks my colleagues and i
have reported on the alleged mishandling
of the pandemic
and ongoing issues within a willoughby
nursing home
more than a dozen family members current
employees and even residents
living there now have contacted me with
similar allegations of staff being
overwhelmed
and the rapid spread of the virus there
they overall don't believe that enough
was done to mitigate the spread of covet
19
at heartland of willoughby that's the
name of the nursing home they feel like
the
numbers aren't being reflected
accurately um
on this on the state website and through
the state department of health
um mike lewis whose wife says he was an
old friend of
uh governor dewine's died at that
nursing home on september 8th
after contracting coveted 19 so governor
you told my colleague ron regan that you
will ask your legal team
to reconsider releasing the total number
of cobit 19 deaths
in each nursing home across the state
but we'd also like to know what more is
being done
aside from state inspections
to hold individual nursing home
facilities accountable
for the spread of covet 19 and i guess
what would you say to family members who
are calling for some sort of
government intervention some some
intervention from the state
who say not enough is being done to
protect their relatives
well thank you for the question i will
have an answer on thursday let me get a
full report instead of just
shooting from the hip here let me let me
get the full report
we'll be back on thursday uh
specifically to answer your question
about that nursing home
and what happened and maybe what didn't
happen
great thank you next question is from
andy chow
at ohio public radio and television hi
andy
hi governor i wanted to talk to you
about the passing of uh supreme court
justice ruth greater ginsburg
your thoughts on her death and how the
u.s senate plans to move forward with a
potential vote even though they did not
hold a vote in 2016 when president
barack obama put up a nominee
well i think first on on her passing and
her life
putting aside decisions put aside
politics
ideology her life story is an
inspiration
and she continued to inspire people
as she fought different health
challenges
and you know wherever you sit on the
political spectrum
you had to be inspired by by her her
focus
on equality
equality for women all she did to
encourage
women all she did in her own personal
life to break down barriers
uh was truly an inspiration uh
she had been honored for all of all of
those things
uh this week as far as the uh
what the us senate is going to do i
spent 12 years in the u.s senate i spent
12 years on the senate judiciary
committee uh went through confirmations
of
two justices of the supreme court
um what i always said at the time uh was
that
as far as making a judgment uh i would
not make a judgment until
you know we had had the opportunity to
take a look at that
at that individual i said the same thing
with district court judges and circuit
court judges so
i'm going to leave it to my friends in
the senate um who will be voting uh
there uh senator brown
senator portman and they're the ones who
were there representing ohio not mike
dewine
i'm focused today on what i need to be
focused which is
which is this where the state is going
how we're fighting the covet
uh how we're bringing jobs back back to
ohio and i'm gonna
i'm gonna stay focused on on that
um you know as far as whether i think
there should be a vote
uh if i was in the senate um you know i
would uh
when that nomination came up and when it
had been into the judiciary
committee uh if i was still on the
judiciary judiciary committee i would
have
done the due diligence that we did and i
would have voted
next question is from kevin landers at
wbns
in columbus hello governor
hi kevin you mentioned the winter is
coming uh
flu and covid are going to smash into
each other
when flu season begins people are going
to have symptoms
um and they won't know whether they have
covet or whether they have the flu
how concerned are you about whether or
not the state has enough tests
to treat everybody who will then be
wanting to know if they have covet 19
or they or
well our team is working on that
hospitals are working on health
professionals are working on it so i
have confidence that we will be able to
do that um
you know again to back up this wasn't
exactly your question
but i would urge people to get their flu
shot you can get it now you know get a
flu shot
you don't what the health experts say is
you don't want covet and the flu at the
same time
you know we don't know what that would
be but we certainly don't want to uh
roll the dice on that so so get the flu
shot
uh flu shot you know cuts down your
chance of getting getting flu but also
your chance if you do get it the
severity of it so it clearly
is in everyone's interest
to get a flu shot we urge people to
really focus
on children as well uh get your own flu
shot get your
children's flu shot if you look at the
danger areas it's
it's the real danger areas it's
early in in a person's life later in the
person's life
uh your mortality rate is up uh in
regard to flu and we do lose flu
as as many of our critics have pointed
out hey we lose a lot of people in flu
every year yes we do but we don't want
to lose them
and so we hope that they're wearing a
mask which we
we know many of the same mitigating
things
to to fight back the covet are things
that you can
use to fight back the flu they're not
inconsistent in fact they're entirely
consistent
and so we just urge people get a flu
shot continue to wear the mask
and that's our best chance of fighting
this back
what will happen we don't know we've
seen some countries in the southern
hemisphere who've had winter
and they've done pretty well with the
virus and they attribute that to the
wearing of the mass
so again let's hope get the flu shot or
but people wear a mask
we can get the number of flu incidents
down and the severity down as well
next question is from danny eldridge at
hannah news service
hello governor um so can you talk a
little bit more about the voter
registration issue you mentioned
in your remarks how did that how did das
become aware of that problem and what is
your administration doing to make sure
that doesn't happen with other
voter registration systems or other
voting systems yeah
let me make sure i i explain it because
it was not part of the voter
registration system really uh it does
not even come under the secretary of
state i'm sure he would
uh frank would like me to say that um
you know the bam
uh that is designed to try to help
more people get registered and so it
as people are applying for benefits or
dealing with the with the state
government in regard to benefits that
they're getting
it gives them an opportunity hey do you
basically hey do you want to be
registered to vote
and so people then can click on that uh
and
and they what should happen is that they
get mailed an application to
vote so we discovered
how many days ago a couple weeks ago i
guess
our team did that hey there's a problem
there's some people who had clicked who
were not didn't get it they went back
examined it the data that i or the
statistics i just
gave a few minutes ago what they found
out um
you know as soon as we found out i said
okay just you know get those
applications in the mail and they did
that
uh those all went out about a week ago
and people should have received them by
now
and so we would urge people now that
you're focused on the election to
uh to go ahead and to fill those out if
that's if you're if you're not
registered
if you're not registered go ahead and
and get registered and for anyone
uh you know you still you still have
some time
until beginning of october i can't
remember the exact date
somebody can help me here john october
fourth fifth something like that but
we'll
that's your last date to register so if
you're not registered
plenty of opportunity to get registered
contact your local board of
elections and get registered
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
hey governor um so data from the cdc
shows that this year alone more
alzheimer's and dementia
patients um are dying which is often
cited as a result of covet 19
unfortunately
but several have also cited the facts
that many of these people
who are in memory care facilities have
not been able to see loved ones and
and friends and family and given what
you were talking about today with the
ventilation systems and whatnot moving
toward winter
how do you preserve those kinds of
visitation and whatnot
as we move toward winter
well these are the these are the tough
gut-wrenching decisions
that we all have to make i have to make
as governor but families have to make
and
people running nursing homes have to
make
you know initially we closed the nursing
homes to visitors
that was the recommendation of every
health expert that we talked to
after a few months it became evident
that there were people in nursing homes
certainly
among those alzheimer's patients who
were not doing well and maybe one of the
reasons they were not doing well
was because they've been cut off from
their loved ones
uh so we looked at that and said okay
how can we how can we deal with this but
virus is still here what's the balance
and so what we came up with is
visitation outside and
that's been going on since i believe
july
we are a little concerned that sometimes
we hear that that
nursing homes are not carrying out
outside visitation
and you know we kind of question that
and sometimes if someone contacts us or
our
aging omnibus person uh you know they
will find out from the nursing on what
what is going on
uh but that's been going on this outside
visitation
now we've got to balance you know how do
we have indoor visitation
but do everything that we can to protect
the people in the nursing home the
residents who live in the nursing home
and we will have that announcement
sometime within the next week or so you
know how we're going to roll out that
visitation but again
in light of the discussion we had today
one of the things that we asked nursing
homes to do is to take a
take a look at their their whole
filtration system the ventilation system
uh and take another look at that that's
important
um we also will be
getting as we move forward we're going
to have more
uh more quicker tests and more cheaper
tests
and i think it's certainly another layer
of protection
certainly could be we're not there yet
but it could be in the future
if someone if you want to come in and
visit that you take a test
15 minutes later if you clear it then
you then you go in
now we're not there yet uh but that's
these
these are on the market we just don't
have the availability yet so
um in answer your question we go about
it very carefully
we we try to be careful we are careful
uh but we also
understand that by not letting someone
in
that's also has a could have a very
detrimental effect
on the resin of the nursing home as well
so these are just these are tough
as i said this is some of the most
gut-wrenching decisions that
that are made because there's no there's
no good and there's no easy answer
next question is from jesse ballmert at
the cincinnati enquirer
hello governor uh yesterday
yesterday uh president trump said that
covet 19 affects virtually nobody
under the age of 18. so i guess my
questions are
is that accurate based on just you're
looking at the data in ohio
and how how does that jive with your
warnings toward
to young people well i didn't hear the i
didn't hear the president say that i'll
take your word for it but i'll just
comment on from a medical
point of view and look what we do every
day is we talk to the best medical
people that we can find
that includes the white house uh people
i was on a call yesterday
with the vice president the number of
the white house medical advisors and
other
other other individuals um so we know
that someone under 18 can get copin
uh we know uh i'll try to do a quick
quick summary we know they can get it
we know they can pass it they can spread
it we also know
that at that age many times they don't
show the symptoms
many times if they do show symptoms
they're not
very serious symptoms but we also know
that
that people teenagers for example can
get pretty sick
and we also worry about you know what is
the long-term damage that we don't the
medical experts
really don't know i mean i've cited the
figures
at ohio state and this was a small small
number of people
but early on in their testing of
athletes
what they found was that it was 13
of those athletes who tested positive
had
this this i can't remember the exact
name but it's a microcardio
uh it is some problem in regard to
inflammation the heart uh in those cases
in each one of those cases at ohio state
there was not a
serious problem but the point was it
needs
that person would need to be cleared if
they're going to be you know play
competitive
athletics or if they're even going to go
out and just you know
and run so you know we've tried to
uh in these uh two o'clock uh sessions
bring you the best medical advice we can
uh we don't claim
uh we have any corner on the best
medical advice but we try to bring this
in
and and talk about this um so
that's that's the summary of what i know
next question is from jack windsor at
wmfd
in mansfield hey jack hello governor
hi sir uh since the high point of 81
percent in april
your approval rating for handling covet
has seen the sixth biggest drop in the
country
as of late august as low as 53 percent
improving
and it seems to continue to drop
yesterday
lieutenant governor was booed a couple
times warming up for president trump
who later announced your name to a
chorus of booze
obviously this isn't a popularity
contest but given the large number of
ohioans who oppose
your direction the number of judges who
have called orders illegal
and then the most recent announcement uh
by a republican representative of a bill
that seeks to strike down the state of
emergency
as in any war have you begun to define
an exit strategy
because you continue to say that ohio is
open but businesses are operating at
less than 50 percent
and many will not survive taking health
insurance and health security away from
thousands of ohioans
so since your oath of office compels you
to protect our constitutional liberties
not make sure people don't get sick what
is the metric not the emotion but the
metric that will cause you to listen
to the growing number number of people
who are asking you to change directions
well
well well well jack as we would say in
debate uh
just because i don't answer every one of
your questions doesn't mean i accept the
facts
um you know businesses for example
yes we control the hours of bars the
state always controls that and they're
less
but a lot of businesses are fully open
um
you know as far as what the state has
has ordered but
uh let me talk for a moment uh
about uh yesterday and the president uh
being there and the
lieutenant governor was there and he as
you all saw he
made some comments about uh uh worm mask
and that didn't go too well some booze
and then the
comments about me and then the president
had some nice things to say about me
you know you know i had a nice chance to
talk on the on the
airplane for a little while along with
members of the congressional delegation
uh but he had some nice things to say
but uh then that did elicit some booze
out there and so
look booing is a uh
first amendment right uh whether you're
at the ballpark or wherever you are at a
political rally
or out protesting somewhere
uh it is a pure first amendment uh right
that
uh that we we fully uh accept
i was kind of reminded uh yesterday when
fran and i left
uh the president's speech and as we're
coming back
back to cedarville i was reminded of
something i observed in the united
states senate with my friend jim bunning
jim bunning
of course was a major league baseball
player
hall of famer great guy and he also
served in the united states senate
and he was in the united states senate
he and i coincided uh
some of our time together overlapped in
the united states
senate i remember one time um
we had was we're having a luncheon of
senate republicans
and uh they're kind of freewheeling and
uh you know there's no press there and
people are saying what they think
uh pretty bluntly uh sometimes and uh
jim got up and he was talking about
something i don't know what it was
but somebody else got up and they were
giving him a hard time
and uh jim looked at this person then
kind of looked all the all the all the
senators and he said you know
guys you just go ahead i'm not worried
about you he said i've uh
i've been booed by thirty thousand
philly fans uh
out on the mound he said if i can be
booed by you guys uh
or moved by them i can certainly you
guys can give me a
give me a hard time and so i'm certainly
not
not a baseball player not a not an
all-star not a member of the hall of
fame
but i i sort of feel that's that same
way
in regard to booing uh people have every
right to boo
uh i've been picketed in the past uh
i've been booed in the past and so
look these are in all seriousness these
are tough decisions
and uh people of goodwill uh
can have very very different uh opinions
about
where the state should go uh how we
should deal with the coveted virus
and even serious you know differences
about
how serious it is uh but every decision
we've made has been based on the best
medical science we can
get i'm going to continue to make the
decisions
that are appropriate i'm going to
continue to work with the state
legislature
but you know getting booed is
you know i'm that's the way it goes and
uh i'm not
i'm not watching the polling uh as uh as
friends
told me uh has told me many times when
uh you know
something good would happen or the polls
would be up and someone would say
something and
you know she would always say well you
know you know
don't get too high don't get too low uh
if you're in politics you just
you know you just do the best you can
you and you move on that's what we're
doing
governor can connect can i add something
to that is that
when we ask people to to wear masks
we're not doing it for our benefit
uh for the governors or mine we're doing
it for them i mean
i i want the folks out there to do it to
protect each other
i wear it so that i'm protecting the
people that i'm around when they wear it
they're protecting me
uh it's just a simple sign of of
how we should care about each other and
i know that not everybody embraces that
and i respect that but you know we've
had success because we've been able
to to convince most people and most
people have
uh are following the rules and and doing
that and
it's not it's not like we want to tell
people what to do
uh frankly this is a this allows us to
open things up these are symbols of
freedom
in the sense that when you do it you
control the virus and more good things
get to happen and
and um you know it uh i know from time
to time people will
will disagree with these things but you
know when tough times come around and
people are struggling
and they want to blow off a little steam
at me i'm happy to take it
um but i'm going to care about them and
we're going to try to get things right
and we'll do our best
governor next question will be the last
question for today and it belongs to ben
schwartz from wcpo in cincinnati
hey ben hi governor um i just want to
kind of follow up a previous question
from the from the dispatch
about um nursing home visitations one of
our wcpo viewers recently reached out
voicing her own concerns about
visitation limits
um showing her frustration that even
though nursing homes are allowed to have
some visitors inside
the state's guidance is still fairly
strict which
our viewer says limits what nursing
homes are willing to allow
so i just want to clarify you mentioned
that we'll have some new information
available next week
are you able to say if that information
will include changes to the current
recommendations regarding visitation and
um
and how hands-on your administration
would be in helping facility
facilities adapt to these changes
well ben yes i mean we're going to allow
some visitation inside as we get into
cold weather
uh director mcelroy uh
was working this morning on this you
know i had a conversation this morning
about it we might have this guidance by
thursday
uh maybe by tuesday and you know
while we have opened the nursing homes
up
we have not compelled the nursing homes
to do it uh because sometimes there are
facts
things that are going on in the nursing
home uh
that we don't know about and so we've
not gone in with a heavy hand in doing
that
um but our our request in nursing homes
is you know they
they do allow the visitation you know if
they've got kova they're spread in the
nursing home obviously you're not going
to do it if they've got
other you know problems or reasons not
to do it uh
you know we would ask them to allow a
reasonable period of time for the for
that
for that visitation but again these are
just tough these are just balancing
um you know the equities and
and the needs and and people in nursing
homes have
the residents have needs families have
needs
we also want to keep them safe and we
want to do what we can
to reduce the chances of the covet
coming into the nursing home
so we we continue continue down that
path
um we'll wrap up uh here
we have a video from a singing group
see if i can get the pronunciation right
capricio
columbus which is a volunteer choir that
performs major classical works
jazz broadway and spirituals under the
direction of its founder
larry griffin in this time of covert the
group
is socially distanced but still singing
together
they sent this video of a song they
recorded called oh love
oh love let's take a listen
[Music]
