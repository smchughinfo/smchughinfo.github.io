foreign
[Music]
done
[Music]
you were behind one to nothing last i i
saw
um i hope it's better luck than the
indians tie a war
indians lost a tough game last night and
the reds
lost a tough game on the noon the noon
game so we'll see
[Music]
i want to begin today talking for a
moment
about the presidential debate that
occurred on
tuesday night i want to congratulate the
cleveland clinic
case western reserve university uh mayor
jackson the city of
cleveland and the police department uh
they all did a
a great great job we're very very proud
of the job that they did so ohioans we
were certainly very proud to host
this debate however
the debate itself was certainly not our
country's finest
hour or not our country's finest 90
minutes
i hope that the next debate will focus
on the future
on the vital issues vital issues on the
decisions
that the next president of the united
states will have to make
on the substantive issues that this
country faces
this is a very important election
as you know i support president trump
his choices for federal district and
circuit court
judges have been exemplary his choices
for supreme court have as well
been excellent his most recent
nomination of judge barrett
is also excellent i could not
be happier with the nomination
i believe his tough stance and trade
negotiations
will continue in the future to expand
job
growth in ohio and in this country
i've known joe biden for many years
having served in the united states
senate
with him while many times we may have
disagreed on policy issues
i know that he too he too
wants what is best for this country of
ours
the name calling by both candidates is
simply not helpful
the name calling by both candidates is
not productive
now each of us
saw this debate through our own eyes our
own
lens through the prism of our own
beliefs
and the candidate that we support
however i do believe that there can be
agreement on what we
as americans have a right to see in the
next
debate what is needed
what is needed in the next debate is a
robust
energetic debate on the challenges that
the next president will face
and as in presidential debates of the
past
each candidate has an obligation
to articulate a vision for the future of
this country
to articulate what kind of a country
that candidate believes we should be
leaving
to our children our grandchildren and
our great grandchildren
as i've done in the past at several
these press conferences
uh i want to talk about hate in america
and this is something that deeply
concerns
me there are fringe groups
and individuals in this country of both
the right
and the left who simply
do not share our common values
who do not share the great values
of this country there are haters
they're people who hate jews
muslims african-americans and we could
go on and on
there is no place in america no place in
this great country
for that there are also people there are
people
who believe that violence is the way to
achieve
political ends
that is not right and i want the end to
speak out
against that
white supremacists know only hate
anti-semites know only hate and we could
go on and on
it sickens me that there are people in
our country who
perpetrate this hate violence
and the work to divide us we cannot let
this these fringe groups of the right or
left divide us
we cannot let them into
that system when they preach violence
when they preach hate as i said at the
end of may following the death of
george floyd we have a responsibility
to each other we have a responsibility
to our country
in all aspects of our lives we simply
must not
allow hate to prevail over love
over kindness over compassion
especially in these times of uncertainty
fear division
because to paraphrase the words of dr
martin luther king
hate is too great a burden
for this country
i want to talk now again about the
sanctity
of the ohio election process
we have a long long history
in this state of running fair
transparent
elections because of laws passed by the
general assembly
work done by republican and democrat
secretaries of the state in the past and
the current
secretary of state frank larose and
because
of democrats and republicans working
together the county level and
at the precinct level
they have worked together successfully
for decades and because of this history
and because of what we have done the
past and what we're going to continue to
do
ohioans can be assured of a fair orderly
election this november as our history
proves our election process in ohio
is orderly it is transparent it's
bipartisan
as ohioans can and should expect
the will of the people in november will
be respected
in ohio and in this country
elections are sacred
there is a sanctity to our election
process
we give them proper respect
there's a reason the flags outside the
polling places are there not only to
signal where that precinct is or where
that voting place is
but they also say to the approaching
voter
this is truly a special place
inside these flags inside these
flags you and your vote are safe
campaigning ceases inside this space
so that voting can go on unfettered so
the people can feel safe
and confident and heard
my commitment to every ohio voter is
this
we will not tolerate any interference in
this sacred process
we will as we have done in the past
protect each citizen's right to vote
and to have their vote counted
the system this bipartisan system
has worked in the past it will work
again
talk to frank larose today he wanted me
to remind you of
several things the last day to register
to vote is this coming monday
if you are not registered you can do at
your board of elections or you can
register online at voteohio.gov
if you are not registered if you aren't
sure about it that
go ahead contact the board of elections
you can go
online
further for over a decade now ohioans
have majority
menu of options for casting their ballot
if you'd like to vote on election day
november 3rd that option
is protected and open to you the polls
will be open from 6 30 a.m to 7
30 p.m at night you can find your
polling place
at voteohile.gov
if you want to vote in person but worry
you won't have time on election day your
county board of elections will begin
opening their early
vote center this coming tuesday october
6th
you can see the hours and locations also
at voteohio.gov
if you prefer to cast your ballot in the
privacy of your own home
secretary larose has mailed an absentee
ballot request form
to all registered voters fill it out
mail it in today
if you misplaced that application or
accidentally threw it away you can
download a new form again
at voteohile.gov
finally i want to address what happens
after the election
one of the things we have done well
throughout our history is the transfer
of power
after an election sometimes
incumbent president is re-elected
sometimes it might be an open seat
sometimes it's a situation where
the incumbent loses but whatever the
situation
whatever the situation since the
beginning of this country
however hotly contested these races have
been however riled up people get
however partisan it gets however
emotional people get
when the results are in when they are in
people will accept it might not like it
but we're americans we accept it
as an author uh theodore white wrote in
a book about another presidential
election a number of years ago
we as americans understand the transfer
of power
we get it we do it right
talking about election day and
ultimately this transfer of power
if you just bear with me for a moment
i'm going to quote what white wrote
it's talking about the campaign and
campaign ending
all of this is in and talking about
election day
all of this is invisible for it is the
essence of the act
that as it happens it is a mystery
in which millions of people each fit one
fragment
of a total secret together none of them
knowing the shape of the whole
what results from the fitting together
of these secrets
is of course the most awesome transfer
of power in the world
the power to marshal and mobilize the
power to send men to kill
or be killed the power to tax and
destroy
the power to create and the
responsibility to do so
the power to guide and the
responsibility
to heal all committed
into the hands of one individual
heroes and philosophers brave men and
vile
have since roman athens tried to make
this particular manner of transfer of
power worked effectively no people
no people has succeeded at it better
over a longer period of time than the
americans
as the transfer this power takes place
there's nothing to be seen
except an occasional line outside church
or school
or file of people fidgeting in the rain
waiting
to enter the booths no bands play on
election day
no troops march no guns are ready no
conspirators gather in secret
headquarters
the noise and the blare the bands and
the screaming
pageantry the oratory the long fall
campaign
fade on election day all the planning is
over
all efforts spent now the candidate
simply
must wait that's what we do
we are americans we do it
very very well and we will do it
this year as well
let me go now to lieutenant governor uh
for a few comments
thank you governor i'm going to start
today by talking about
workforce issues jobs and what we
consider the foundation
of a prosperous economy we're going to
talk about tech cred
starting off the august round was
record-setting
with more than 1227
credentials
[Music]
more than the june round uh for
reference we had 3 241 credentials in
june we had
44 168 credentials awarded in august
today we are announcing that 288 ohio
companies have been approved for more
than 3.4 million dollars in this round
to earn those 4468 credentials
these are remember industry recognized
tech credentials and after five rounds
of funding
we now have 983 ohio employers that have
been approved
for 11 941 tech
focus credentials i make this
announcement with
a bit of uh satisfaction because as you
recall governor
we promised that we were going to try to
do at least 10 000 of these
in the first year and we're
exceeding that mark with over with
nearly 12 000
and we we believe
that these micro degrees these tech
credentials these industry credentials
are the foundation of a growing vibrant
economy more and more employers are
turning
to these industry recognized credentials
as
evidence that you can do the job and in
this case they are
upskilling their existing workforce
helping those individuals
not only contribute to the success of
the company but also
to their own success by helping them
potentially earn more
helping them become more job secure
we are announcing today our next round
which opens up today
october 1st hard to believe it's october
1st already
and that will close on october the 30th
anybody who's interested in more
information go to techcred.ohio.gov
to find out how you as an employer can
get funding to upskill your workforce
and how individuals can get these tech
based credentials
now i'm going to turn to
dr abby norris turner from the ohio
state university
as many of you know we worked with the
ohio department of health to perform an
antibody study
our abbey did and her team to learn more
about the rate of the virus spreading
and to create
a benchmark for positive results so we
can know more accurately how
to track the spread in coming months
really we're trying to find out maybe
how many people have had the virus how
many people have the virus
what we can learn for that i
am it's great that dr abby norris turner
is able to join us today to talk dr
turner norris turner is an infectious
disease epidemiologist
she has decades of experience in this
area and has shifted her focus this year
to understanding the epidemiology of
covid19 in our state
she has been a great resource to the
governor and me
and our entire team throughout and i
want to thank
dr norris turner for joining us and and
if you could doctor please let us know
how the study was conducted and what you
found
yes i'm happy to do that um and it's
really a pleasure to be able to be with
you here today
um so i want to start out of course by
also thanking
the colleagues who helped to make this
work happen so
both folks i worked with at ohio state
but also an incredible group
at the ohio department of health also
our partners with
our partnerships with local health
departments and local health districts
who let us work out of their buildings
during 20 hot days in july
and more than 100 study staff members
who helped us
to collect data and supported the teams
in the field with logistics
and other and other tasks and most
importantly the participants so folks
across the state of ohio
who agreed to join this project and help
us answer this question
uh so to jump right into it um the
purpose of this project that we carried
out
was to create or to calculate two
specific
estimates um the first was the estimate
of
active covid19 so how many people have
covered 19 at that moment in time
the second was to estimate the
prevalence of people who had had covet
19
in the past and the way that we did that
was to
select 240 census tracts that are
geographically representative across the
state
and then within those 240 census tracts
we randomly sampled
households um once we had that
that list of households we sent folks
first a postcard
and then a letter which explained what
would happen with the research study and
also gave them instructions for how they
could opt out of participation
if they knew ahead of time they didn't
want to join the study um
from people that we did not hear from
ahead of time we visited them
at their home and we explained the study
in person if someone was home
and if someone was not home we left
information about the study
at the home and asked them to call us in
which case we would
or or text us or email us in which case
we'd come back
for people who are interested in
proceeding we went through the process
of informed consent so they understood
what was involved with the project and
those who consented then went on to give
biological samples which is what we
we then tested to be able to come up
with our estimates of infection
um so a trained nurse from the ohio
department of health
first collected a blood sample which we
tested for antibodies against covin-19
and then a nasopharyngeal swab sample
which is what we tested to look for
active disease
and these results at the end of the
study are combined statistically
so the households going into the census
tract and the census tract
representing the state to come up with
these estimates that would be a
statewide estimate of prevalence
so over these 20 days in july from july
9th to july 28th
727 ohio adults participated
in the research and once the laboratory
assays were done we combined those
findings using
a bayesian statistical approach to
generate these estimates and so
for active disease we found that 0.9
of the sample so that's just under one
percent of the sample
had active covid19 during that time um
and the confidence interval around that
0.9
percent goes from point one percent to
two point zero percent
um and following a similar process
looking at the antibody findings
we found that one point five percent of
people in the study
had evidence of antibodies to cobit
nineteen um and the confidence
interval around that goes from 0.3 to
2.9
and just a note of a sort of reminder to
folks thinking about those antibody
results
we now understand that the assays that
are conventionally used to measure
antibodies to coven 19
they are only provide a look back window
of about three months
so that those antibody numbers don't
tell us who's been infected since the
beginning of the pandemic in ohio
for a study done in july it's really
only a maximum look back to about the
middle of april
we don't have a lot of data to compare
our findings to but what we do have
suggests that what we found is right
along with expectations so
those numbers are similar for example to
what the ohio red cross is reporting
among antibody prevalence for antibody
prevalence among blood donors
and just this week cdc released findings
from a large zero prevalence study that
they're doing
across the whole country including in
ohio and our results are also similar to
what they found
well great um i know that uh
that a lot of people have been you know
awaiting this to find out because
somebody always wants to ask the
question
how many people in ohio have had the
virus
i know that that this study you know
can't definitively
tell us this you know what if you look
out and try to do your best
to extrapolate out how many people can
we estimate in ohio
may have had the virus already or
currently do
yeah such an important question and of
course critical for understanding
kind of what's coming next right we
always want to look back at what's
happened
so far so
one of the important answers to this
question is that these data from this
study can't give us a precise number
what we can say more generally and with
confidence is that the prevalence of
cova 19
among adults in ohio this study only
only tested in adults
but the prevalence in adults in ohio is
relatively low
has remained relatively low the flip
side of that coin of course
is that that means many more people are
still susceptible
to infection so just to convert some of
our prevalence
numbers uh estimates into real numbers
um i told you that 0.9 of the sample
had active disease during during this
period of july
and if you look at the population of
ohio adults that corresponds
to about 80 thousand ohio adults who
would have had cova during these 20 days
in july similarly if you look for that
at that 1.5 percent antibody prevalence
that corresponds to about 133 000 ohio
adults
who had evidence of past infection but
we can't really extend those numbers to
other time periods
because whether people were exposed
depends on the prevalence at other time
periods
in that in and um and basically what was
the circulation
of the virus in their communities at
those other time periods
so it's hard it's hard to take what we
learned from july and make a broader
argument than just that period of time
um again though even in place of exact
estimates what we can say with
confidence
is that some hundreds of thousands of
ohioans have had covid
and millions of ohioans remain
susceptible to covid
so the same public health efforts which
have worked to keep the prevalence of
disease low are still needed to prevent
ongoing and forward transmission
[Applause]
another question i know that i i always
get a lot of people who are curious
because the antibodies
stay in our system somewhere i think i
heard you say maybe you didn't say it in
this
but on another time you know about 50 of
them
fifty percent of the sample keeps
antibodies antibodies for
two months um some of the the other
fifty percent may be for three months
but very few people carry antibodies
beyond three months that are detectable
but that doesn't mean
that they that after three months that
they still don't have some type of
immunity that we would expect so
to give us a a feel for what that means
in terms of antibodies and immunity to
the virus once you've had it
yes i'm happy to tell you what what's
the state of the science
at this moment with immunity um and with
the
huge caution that this like so many
things with covet this is changing all
of the time as we have
new information from around the world
really so
so what you said is is true which is
um most people will no longer have
detectable antibodies
um at least from what is measured in
these conventional assays
for longer than than three months um
and what that means after that three
month period for their immunity
is really still an open question um it
may be that there are other
elements of their immune system that are
still active
but we're not measuring that and so we
don't know if that's providing some kind
of protection
similarly what we tend to do is measure
the level of antibodies in people's
blood
but maybe what we should be measuring
instead is the activity of those
antibodies how good
is that person's antibodies at
neutralizing the virus when exposed for
example and maybe that's more meaningful
for understanding
their immunity so to answer your
specific question
um maybe there's some short-term
protection um
and epidemiologically we we don't see a
lot of reinfection
occurring in that three-month window so
so maybe there's some short-term
um protection against against
re-infection um
we are starting to see re-infections in
the scientific literature now
although they tend to happen a little
bit longer after the initial infection
and what's really unclear right now is
whether those are going to be general
trends
that that the population at large will
be susceptible longer
uh or after some time or whether there's
something special about those people
maybe they they didn't
mount a full immune response at the time
um and so they remained susceptible
so so i guess the conclusion to this is
that covert 19 continues to surprise us
um and so we shouldn't make any
optimistic or pessimistic
uh predictions about short or long-term
immunity to disease
but those surprises keep giving us
opportunities to work with stakeholders
really across the state and around the
world to answer those questions
great well thanks for doing the study
for us and for
joining us today i know that
more information about the study will be
available on our coronavirus website
under the dashboard overview we really
appreciate uh what you did to help us
have a little better perspective on this
um i guess probably one more question
ohio fits in
compared to how and some of the studies
have gone on in the other states are we
pretty comparable uh in the
very local region of the midwest where
we are we are among
the lowest so um i believe west virginia
and at the time that the the study was
done wisconsin were slightly lower than
ohio
um were quite similar to indiana and
um we're lower of course than
pennsylvania and
um you know much lower than than new
york
um so yeah well great we appreciate your
time
thank you very much thank you so much
a couple of uh final issues we like to
highlight
we like to highlight businesses who are
stepping up
to try to help us work through the virus
response and to help the citizens of the
state of ohio
learn to live with a virus in their
lives and get through it
as well as we can today i want to
highlight uh
an announcement that's being made by the
foundation
for appalachian ohio we
governor and i often talk about the need
for internet connectivity
for our students for health care for the
economy
and today the foundations i'm
a child of appalachia fund has partnered
with facebook
and t-mobile to provide hot spots to
libraries
in southeast ohio that will be made
available
to be checked out like other library
resources
facebook is providing these mobile
hotspots at no cost to the libraries
along with six months of unlimited data
usage on the t-mobile network and then
t-mobile
is kicking in an additional six months
so these hot spots will be available
for a full year of unlimited data for
use by
library patrons as well as helping those
hot spots
already in use the foundation for
appalachia ohio
appalachian ohio is one of the many
organizations to help us fill
this important role if you'd like to
find out more about the effort you can
go to
appalachianohio.org
uh this initiative very complementary to
something the governor and i
announced where we put 50 million
dollars of cares act funding
made that available for schools this
will help communities and families as
well
this pilot will be or this
program will be available at a minimum
in athens
harrison highland jackson lawrence meigs
pike minton in vinton counties and
there's an endeavor to get out a total
of 240 hot spots to the libraries
uh in these in these communities to help
extend
uh broadband high-speed internet i
should say high-speed internet service
to the people in these communities so
thanks to
uh the foundation and facebook and
t-mobile for stepping up
to help people in this time of need and
then finally
uh a quick update
last year i went to london
to work with jobs ohio on the london
stock exchange group
moving its america's headquarters to
cleveland due to covid that
has been postponed the physical location
of the headquarters until 2021
but that doesn't mean that the virtual
uh the virtual
efforts are not underway they absolutely
are
and i'm glad to announce today the
financial support thanks to the
financial support
of the greater cleveland partnership
fifth third bank and jobs ohio
that over 10 companies will be
beginning to participate in the elites
international private company
development platform
the cleveland cohort will start on
october the 12th
why is this important because the
companies that participate in this
historically have experienced seven
times the growth created four times more
jobs
than their industry peers we want to
jump start
these activities these businesses in
ohio
to take them from small businesses to
medium businesses medium-sized
businesses maybe someday
even a larger business by helping them
understand how they can grow and connect
to the rest of the world and so
we appreciate that the global elite
program
and and the partnership the cleveland
growth partnership and and fifth third
bank along with jobs ohio
are helping to promote this and get this
started and governor
if just one thing i'd like to say in
support of your earlier comments
uh thank you for what you said about
america
and our democracy and our elections uh
our elections in ohio are tried true
true and tested and i want to remind
folks i had the privilege of serving
ohio as ohio secretary of state for
eight years
and as its chief elections official and
remember elections in ohio are run by
your neighbors
the 88 county boards of elections they
are made up of democrats and republicans
that live in your community
the local polling locations are are
operated
by men and women who are your friends
and neighbors
and if you have concerns if you have
questions about whether the elections
process
is going to run well be part of it you
can be a poll worker
the elections the people who run
elections in ohio are the people of ohio
you can be one of them so go to
voteohio.gov
and sign up to be a poll worker because
our election
system in ohio is a great one
because it's run by the people of our
state it's
it's something that you can count on
please participate
as a poll worker it will give you
insights and
probably help you build confidence in
the system we have in our state
governor thank you very much and back to
you lieutenant governor thank you very
much
um we're going to try to get this much
time for questions
today but i do want to go through this
pretty quickly this is thursday so this
is the day we put
new data out so let's go to our daily uh
slide which is up here what you will see
here
you know we were tracking down
and for a while we had an average below
a thousand cases a day uh now we're
above that and as you can see uh for
yesterday the most recent data
it's 1327 cases so
going going starting to go back up it
looks like
in regard to that i'd also mention the
positivity number
uh which we talk a lot about and you'll
see that in a minute and some other
states where
we're advising you to be careful if you
go there our positivity
for the last month or so has been coming
down um
and it got below a little bit below
three percent
three percent in fact i think it was
down at one point to two point six
uh we're now starting to see it go back
up and so we don't know
that's a long-term trend our most recent
day
was four percent uh we're averaging a
little bit over three percent
um so we're watching that we don't know
that's a long-term trend or not we
certainly hope it is not but we're
seeing the cases
go up and we're starting to see the
positivity inch back up
and we hope it's not a long trend um
eric let's look at the
case possiblization and death table
we won't go through this this is posted
you can take a look at it but if you
want to look at your county
what you can do is you can look and see
the number of cases
we have this in september
so as september ends you can look back
and see cases how many cases your county
had new cases your county had
in the month of september how many
people went to the hospital were
hospitalized during that period of time
and then you also see the number of
deaths that are reported
uh during that period of time these are
lagging indicators
um and they they lag behind and as i've
said before the deaths are reported when
we get them
not necessarily when that death death
actually
actually occurred eric let's go to the
travel advisory map
these are the county excuse me these are
the states
we'll see how good everybody's uh map
map judgment is here but these are the
states that
have over 15 percent
seven day moving average
highlight states are ones that are
currently reporting a positivity of 15
percent or more
so again you're traveling to those
states obviously
and coming back be careful if you're
traveling there staying for a while be
careful
uh as well let's look now at our next
slide eric this is
um top 20 counties
ranked by highest occurrence uh
again there's really two different ways
we're looking at this
one is is the color code uh seven
different indicators some of these are
leading indicators kind of showing you
the trends
where things are going then there's this
and this is something we started a month
or so ago to show you
which counties have the highest number
of cases
per hundred thousand populations so we
can compare apples to apples
over the last two weeks so that's a
that's a that would
normally is normally as it is a two-week
rank
and that's what you're seeing that's
what you're seeing here
and again you can you can take a look at
those on
online uh let's move now to
our color code maps eric and
see what our changes we might have here
um this is our alert map again we use
the term alert because it kind of gives
people an indication of
of some of the early indicators as well
as what's going on now
we're seeing more red counties this week
again that's
not good we have 11 red counties more
than we've seen at any point
in september although many ohioans are
certainly working hard to keep
this virus in check unfortunately we're
seeing a rebound in some areas of the
state
southwest ohio we're seeing a couple
more counties go back
to red we saw an increase in cases among
college students in late august
and september uh thankfully these cases
were mostly in young and healthy people
our concern of course always is that
they spread that to
to others uh and we don't know frankly
if the
uptick that we're seeing in these
counties uh
is due to spread from these college
students or not we
really our data team cannot tell that at
this
at this point uh our colleges are doing
a good job
uh they're fighting back they've worked
hard to keep these cases under control
let me talk about the four new red
county
four new red counties are claremont
hamilton
muskingham and richland
let me just go through quickly a few of
the all of the counties
mercer county continues as read this
week

spread the county has had two small
long-term
care facility outbreaks and officials
are also seeing scattered cases within
the school district
putnam county continues read this week
the county meets the cdc's threshold for
high incidents
local health department officials
attribute the continued community spread
to transmission within families
and between groups of friends and
families getting together they also said
they're having
a concerns with people following
appropriate quarantine and isolation
instructions
pike county can they continue red this
week the county meets the cdc's
threshold for high incidents
and during the past two weeks the county
has had 47
cases that represents about a fourth of
their total cases since the beginning of
the pandemic
the county has had at least 22 cases
linked to a large event
the event was in a neighboring county
but pike county residents attended the
county also has
has spread from family and friends just
getting together
household transmissions and communities
spread

week the county meets the cdc's
threshold for high incidents butler
county's
health department said miami university
cases have stayed steady
about 20 to 25 new cases per day schools
have been doing very well although
there have been some k-12 been doing
very well
there's been some spread associated with
sports teams
many of the county schools will be
transitioning to in person in october
residents continue to have large
gatherings which is causing a lot of
this
problem no mass worrying and no social
distancing
is what our local officials tell us in
butler county
let's move to muskingum they return
unfortunately to red this week the
county was last read on august
13th only stayed read for that week the
county has had 105 cases during the past
two weeks which is a fourth excuse me a
fifth of their total cases
during the pandemic local health

that they have 42 cases 42 cases
linked to an outbreak that spans across
the eagles the moose lodges the vfw
and the american legion there have been
nine hospitalizations
two people in the icu and one death
associated with the outbreak
local health department officials asked
the clubs to close to slow the spread
and all four
comp complied uh as of this morning the
county had 90
active cases and 333 people an active
quarantine hospitalizations have also
increased montgomery county
has been read now for more than a month
the county meets the cdc's threshold for
high incidence
uh university of dayton is reporting
fewer cases
school dashboard report reported 25
cases on tuesday
nine cases on wednesday the school
transitioned to remote learning for two
weeks and returned to in-person classes
on september 24th
montgomery county officials are also
reporting some cases in school districts
and the county also has a large nursing
home outbreak
let's move to sciota county saturday
county continues
as read this week there has been a
sustained increase in new cases growing
from an
average of four and a half cases per day
average
from september 18th to almost eight
average cases per day on september 25th
outpatient visits for covid like
illnesses are also increasing from an
average of 13
visits per day on september 19 to 21
average visits per day on september 26th
local health department officials report
cases associated with sports teams
social gatherings and community spread
hamilton county unfortunately hamilton
county returns red this week the last
time the county was read was july
30th during the past two weeks the
county has had 737
new cases an average of about 50
new cases per day and close to where the
county has
been most recently according to local
university dashboards cases at the
universities
total about 200 during the past two
weeks however it's important to note
that the university cases
are on the decline good news and there
is a shift towards a greater percentage
of cases
in older adults the county is also
a recent sustained increase in
outpatient visits
let's turn to richland county they meet
six of seven indicators this week
and they are on our watch list the
county has more than doubled their
increase in new cases
growing from four average new cases per
day on september 19th and nine
average new cases per day on september
25th county added
95 new cases during the past two weeks
these case
numbers exclude exclude incarcerated
individuals
so we're not counting that the county
also has sustained increases in health
care utilization including
outpatient and emergency department
visits and hospital admissions
local health department officials report
community spread and outbreaks at
correctional centers and a long-term
care facility
they also report that families continue
to plan events
and that is part of big events and
that's part of the problem
that they're seeing ashland county
ashland county continues read this week
the county meets four indicators
and is seeing a sustained increase in
new cases local health department
officials report that there is a large
outbreak in a long-term care facility
and an outbreak at ashland university
there are also outbreaks associated in
an event center where a wedding was held
a workplace
and social gatherings the health
department officials report they are
seeing more community spread of the
virus and unfortunately there is
resistance to mass worrying and social
distancing in the county
let's go back to southwest ohio clermont
county returns red this week
county was last read on august 20th the
county has
added 129 new cases during the past
14 days the county is seeing an increase
in health care utilization including an
outpatient and emergency department
visits local health department officials
in claremont county reporting outbreaks
in a long-term care facility
and a small workplace outbreak
although the county did have some cases
associated with sports teams overall
schools are doing well with compliance
and case management
schools also have been cautious about
sponsoring events and many who cancel or
change their homecoming plans
however the health department told us
they have concern about
parents that are holding alternative
events let me talk for a moment
about a couple of stories we've heard
this week from local health
officials uh again we tell these
just as as a warning really uh first
example involves a couple the husband
who was in his 80s
passed away of a non-coveted related
cause
his funeral was in a neighboring state
his 85 year old widow attended
the funeral director in the neighboring
state did not wear a mask
and pass covet to the widow who
subsequently became ill
and died another example a man was in
icu for a non-coveted related reason the
hospital tested him initially
and he was negative his wife continued
to come visit him but refused to wear a
mask despite the best efforts of
hospital staff
to encourage her to do so she started
feeling ill after a few days and tested
positive now her husband also
is a covet is coveted positive
these are just several examples again
just just sad sad cases we only share
them
just to show how easily that this can be
uh transmitted
i am going to stop we were going to hear
from alicia nelson
who is our recovery ohio director she
will join us next week
because we're out of time but she will
talk about
the problem of drugs and how we are
trying to deal with that we've talked
about that in the past but we're
we continue to see uh the drug problem
uh one of the
sad outcomes or sad things we're seeing
from covetous we've seen an increase in
in drug use uh in ohio
uh we'll now go for our questions
governor your first question today is
from scott halas
at the xenia daily gazette hey scott hey
governor how are you
good good this may be the worst time to
ask this question given the what you
said about some of the cases
being on the rise and the positivity
coming up but we've got high school
playoffs starting up they just announced
the football
brackets today they're actually being
loaded as we speak
is there any talk of maybe increasing
the amount of
fans that are going to be allowed
especially as we get deeper in the
tournament
and they tend to use bigger stadiums
well our goals scott remain the same and
that is that parents have the
opportunity to go see their kids play
family members so if anything is done
and we're open to to talk
from to the school officials we granted
for example
the local health departments and the
state dozens of variances
uh throughout this year in regard to to
their schools
in order to allow parents to attend and
that's our goal so as we look at
playoffs
that will remain our goal and you know
as we look at you know every sport's
different
cross country is a lot different than
football you know we're open to try to
accommodate so that
the athletes can run
play football whatever this sport is
um and at the same time the parents can
come and see them play their loved ones
can see them play so that will be our
kind of our
our north star as we as we look at that
next question is from john london at
wlwt in cincinnati
hey john governor hamilton county and
clermont county uh
going red and butler county staying red
you know that's a big section of
southwest ohio and i'm wondering what
you envisioned for the early fall now
going into thanksgiving
and what actions you might consider
should the numbers go higher for schools
sports
and daily activity
well john that's a it's a good question
um
we monitor this every single day
we're on the phone with local health
departments frequently we're talking to
school superintendents i get emails from
different
superintendents um you know
in regard to our schools i think our
schools are doing a very good job
uh they're on this they're doing the
best job that they can
what we're seeing is you know our
concern
was that when we saw outbreak with kids
that that would lead to outbreak with
older
ohioans we are seeing that what we don't
know is if there's a cause and effect
we're seeing
more from older ohioans you know for a
month or so it's been
you know a big percentage is under under
the age of 30.
now we're seeing these numbers go back
up with an older population
and so uh the the simplest thing to do
um is to be able to curtail
uh these events i mean i i
read examples if we could get
80 85 percent of the people in this
state in every county to wear a mask
when they're out in public
and to avoid these big events
we'd have this thing under control i
mean it'd still be here
uh but we would have it under control
and so i know everybody's tired i'm sick
of it
you're sick of it we're all sick of it
uh
but we got to hang in here uh you know i
get the question a lot when mike when's
this over when can i take my mask off
when can i go about life is normal and i
don't have a great answer
but the best answer i can come up with
is when
we can that will happen when we get
hurt immunity and as you heard from the
discussion
uh that john husted had in the study
that he presented today
we're not going to get that without the
vaccine i mean we're not going to work
our way into this for
years so what we have to do
is hang in there we got to keep this
virus low
keep our foot on us on its neck
and wait and we wait for the vaccine to
hit and when
it gets here and the first people
started
getting the shots we got to encourage
everybody to get one
they can and it's going to come layered
it's going to start with
with our most vulnerable people in our
nursing homes and others is going to
talk
start with our first responders and it's
going to take a while to get this out
but the point that we get this way
way out so we've got a significant
segment of the population and i don't
know what that
segment is but significant segment you
know that have that
that immunity if these if this does in
fact work the way we hope it will
then that's when we see the end of this
um
i mean look we're tough for ohioans
we've been after seven months or so
uh and it's it's not easy but we just
got to keep going
uh or we're gonna have these outbreaks
and when we hit the outbreaks
i know this has been tough on business i
know it's been tough on bars i know it's
been tough on restaurants
i know it's been tough on a lot of small
businesses and i know it's been tough on
people losing their jobs
and if we're gonna have any chance of of
continuing to grow the economy then
we've got to keep our
foot on this on this devil down there
and
it can only be by people wearing masks
so the things to do
john differently there aren't different
things to do
it's we just got to do what we know we
got to do and
if we get those numbers back i mean i
was look i was on the phone this week
with a number of health directors who
who said look our mass compliance was
going up it was great
now it's starting to go down again and i
get it people are wore out but
but we're we're oh high ones we can't
get wore out we got we got to hang in
there
and by hanging in there and doing the
things we need to do our kids can play
sports our kids can go to school
we can keep our businesses open but it's
only if we do these other things like
we're in the mass could keep
and keep a distance that's where we are
next question is from laura hancock at
cleveland.com
hi laura
we'll come back to laura next question
is from alex ebert
at bloomberg
good afternoon governor thanks for your
time larry
is expected to introduce a bill called a
trigger ban
which would eliminate the right to have
an abortion in ohio
if roe v wade is overturned by the
supreme court
do you support a trigger ban for the
state of ohio i i have not looked at is
literally the first thing i have heard
about it
as i think as you could tell by my
comments about president trump's
appointments the court
you know like strict constructionists
people believe in the constitution
and i think everybody knows i'm pro-life
uh but i'm not looked at this
uh literally this is the first i've i've
heard of this
i don't know what it does
we'll go back to laura hancock at
cleveland.com
good afternoon governor um the
legislature has not
acted to repeal house spill six yet
um attorney general dave yost has called
in the utilities to prove they need the
money
ohioans are going to start paying these
fees and our utility bills
soon as governor do you have any duty to
them
to make sure that house bill 6 doesn't
come to fruition
well i think the attorney general's
right that we need to know this
uh one of the issues that has been
debated and kicked around
is whether or not you know the
legislature
want to pass the original bill had
enough information
about what the need was to keep the
nuclear plant open uh and so
i'm always for transparency and i've not
talked to
the attorney general about this we'll
talk about the process of who should do
it
but i think he's from what i read in the
paper at least i think he's right
that transparency is always good and
more information about
you know what their actual financial
situation is would be helpful
and and this is yeah again again i would
like to see the repeal as i've said
as i've said this needs to be repealed
because the process
was so flawed that it has
it has cast a a a light on this
uh bill that it can never recover from i
mean we've got to
repeal it and then figure and figure out
where we're going from there but
that's that's been my position it
remains my position
next question is from jim province at
the toledo blade
hey jim hello governor um i think this
question is probably for the lieutenant
governor or for abby
now that we have this information from
the prevalent study
is there some practice with that too
curious as to whether there is something
or a decision we can make
jim we're losing you unfortunately at
least i am i don't know whether
lieutenant governor can hear you or not
but
yeah i couldn't hear the question yeah
jim can you try it again
uh i think we've lost jim we'll uh bring
him back up when he reconnects
next question is from marty schleiden at
the ohio capitol journal
good afternoon governor afternoon marty
um last week when i asked you about the
president's refusal to say that he would
promise to abide by
uh the outcome of the election you
responded by saying you didn't know what
was in its heart
but of course i wasn't asking about what
was in his heart i was asking about
what he said and what he's not said and
again before
tens of millions of people during the
debate he refused to
say that he would abide by the results
of an election in which he's behind in
the polls and
you know i want to be clear about what's
at stake here uh hundreds of
americans have died on hundreds of
battlefields affecting
the principle that an adopted democracy
leaders yield power to the will of the
voters so
respectfully i'd like to ask you again
do you contempt
condemn trump's refusal to say he'll
respect the will of the voters
or i i think i addressed this you know
in my opening statement that
whoever loses
once it's determined that they've lost
they lose and you know we we can go back
in the most
hard-fought campaigns in anyone's memory
and as i said the other day my dog is
jumping up here
um as we said the other day
first election i really remember as is
nixon and kennedy and people won nixon
you know uh won nixon to contest it hey
they stole the election from you in
chicago they did this and that
and you know he said no i'm not going to
do it
i'm not i'm not going to do it
the gore bush nothing could be more
highly contested went all the way the
supreme court went into december
uh but when the when it was finally
clear court of rule that was it
you know losing candidate
vice president gore conceded
so whoever loses will concede
this is what we do as americans so
you know this is what we do and
this is what we expect and that's the
name of the game when you get in the
game you know that you may lose someday
you may lose in presidential election or
u.s senate race or
state legislature and you lose you lose
that's it so look any anything to the
contrary is just not right i mean
no this is what is great about this
country
um we have carried this out as theodore
white the
excerpt i read says you know we've done
longer than anybody else has
and we've done it successfully and we do
it every four years
and i'll tell you we're going to do it
this year
uh jim province from the toledo blade is
back uh jim please ask yourself
hi can you hear me now you're good you
sound good
great um i was just trying to get at the
practical
um aspect of the prevalence study is
there something that we can do
today today that we were not able to
make before we had this information
john can you hear that yeah i i did
you know look we we wanted
we wanted to have information about
active cases and get estimates about how
many people
have potentially had the virus and
um you know when we
had the conversation with the doctor uh
she
she indicated that you know it's hard to
make a hard and firm estimate
i i in looking at the math and having
conversations with people who've looked
at the data
believe that one could conclude that
hundreds of thousands of people have had
the virus that
that you could you look at that
information and
reasonably conclude that five to six
hundred thousand people
maybe have had the virus again not hard
and fast
this this information will be out there
other people will be able to look at it
and come to their own conclusions but i
think the big thing that we know
is that look the goal ultimately is to
get to herd immunity
and that we're going to need a vaccine
to do that if there's one takeaway that
i had from that
information is that we've got a long way
to go
and we've got to get a vaccine and that
the the combination of the two
are the way that we get there and and i
don't know if dr
norris turner is uh on if she could she
wants to offer
any any uh conclusions to that beyond
what i've said um i think maybe we could
have her join
yes i'm still here and i can jump in
quickly
um which is to say that most of the
testing and prevalence information that
we have
in ohio but also across the country
comes from people seeking testing
because they're
unwell or they've had a documented
exposure so
um this was the first study that really
tried to get an estimate much more
broadly
around the number of people who who had
either had infection
in that period in july or or who'd been
exposed without depending on
um their access to testing or their
their desire to be tested um or a
requirement for them to be tested so
when that has been done in other
settings
sometimes what happens is that you learn
that a lot more people had
had infection in the past than had been
reflected
through other data streams um and so
what this study did was to confirm that
in fact the data that we are getting
through other data streams other
surveillance efforts other projects of
the ohio department of health
and others pretty you know do give us a
good sense of how many people have been
have been exposed and how many people
have been sick there wasn't a huge
number of people um and in some other
studies particularly in new york in the
beginning of the epidemic some of the
early cereal prevalence studies
suddenly suggested that lots more people
had been sick than had been
known about and and that's not been the
case in ohio um
there are more cases from our study
there are more cases
in the state than are picked up in
testing that's not a surprise that's a
very standard finding across the country
um but it's not a huge difference it's
not an enormous
disparity and um so we should keep on
doing what we've been doing in terms of
embracing public health
efforts those things are working and the
prevalence is is staying low because of
them
next question is from jim oddy at
w-h-i-o in dayton
governor i have a question going back to
your original uh statement at the very
beginning of all this and that is
uh about the debate the other night i
know you've been part of a lot of
debates
i don't remember you yelling over the
top of your opponent
or them yelling over the top of what
you're trying to say would you support
the commission on presidential debates
going to a mute button that would be
controlled by the moderator so they
could cut somebody off as soon as they
start
violating the rules and trying to shout
down their opponent
well they've already said they're going
to look at this there's certainly been
speculation they might
might do that i think they'll do
whatever they think is necessary to
you know have us focused uh more on more
on substance i don't i wouldn't have any
objection to it i'm not
i'm not a candidate but i wouldn't have
any objection to it
i will say jim as you've watched some of
the debates i've been in and
frankly sometimes you know in in the
battle you get overheated
but um you know that's
that that does in fact happen but um
you know the white house is at stake
the leader of this country will be
selected
it's important that the american people
be able to see
the exchange of ideas
because there are differences
fundamental differences between
uh two these two candidates both both
love america
both love our country but there's
fundamental differences
and i do would hope that the next debate
debates actually as a vp of debate and
then there's
two more presidential i believe um that
they would focus on
on those differences uh i think it's
legitimate for someone to say what
they've done i think it's legitimate
from someone to criticize someone for
what they've done
we're not done i think those are all
things in bounds
so you know this is a
a robust as i described it a moment ago
a robust
discussion debate um hard fought
uh is what the american people expect
but i think they expect it over over the
issues
and be able to sit back and watch this
for
90 minutes or however long it lasts
the the debase of the base of
historically um
you know we went for many many many
years without these formal debates
uh you know but beginning in 1960 we we
had
had one and then i think it picked up
again and i don't know whether it's
68 or 72 but at some point picked up
again then we've now it's a
something we do every every four years
um
so anything that will enhance that
debate
i'm i'm for next question is from andy
chow at ohio public radio and television
hi governor hey andy governor
at the beginning of this you spoke about
denouncing white supremacy the sanctity
of the elections
you just answered marty's question about
you feel pretty confident about a
peaceful transition of power
but how can the citizens of ohio feel
confident about all those things when
president trump
undermines those things and you refuse
to speak out against him when he does
undermine things
like the sanctity of elections like the
peaceful transition of power
like not denouncing white supremacy
you don't speak out against him
i think i've been pretty clear today
um a pretty clear message
what i believe is govern the state of
ohio
this will be a fair election uh
the votes will be counted nobody else
will decide but the voters
however this election comes out as well
as all the other elections
that's who will win any idea that the
legislature will do anything
it's not going to happen we have run
fair elections in ohio for a long long
time there's no reason to think that
this election will not be
a fair one and i think it so it's
important on both sides
um let's not presuppose
we're going to have a problem
when we have both parties who have a
vested interest
in a fair election as john husted
pointed out
what we do in ohio and i suppose they do
in most states is
down to the precinct level we have both
parties involved
it is a system sure there could be a
mistake there can be mistakes
made we don't say it's perfect
but this this elect people should have
confidence in ohio
that that their vote is going to get
counted and they have myriad ways of
voting
um and so we have an obligation to make
sure
that happens we have an obligation to
make sure that
people are right or left who believe in
disturbance
don't believe in the rule of law who
believe that
violence should take over that
that is dealt with and we fully intend
to do that
in the state of ohio um
you know press out conference after
press conference
you know i get asked about different
comments made by the president
somebody else you know i'm not here to
answer every single thing the president
says
i think i've been very clear
throughout my career and throughout
my time as governor what i believe in
and what we will do is not just what i
believe in it's not just what i say is
what we do
and so you know we'll continue to speak
out
against violence we'll continue to speak
out
against you know anything that disrupts
the fairness of an election will
continue to speak out against hatred
and violence that's that's what my
job is my job is not every single day to
critique the president of the united
states
nor to critique joe biden
and you know if there's another
president in there
in january i'll have the same attitude
look i gotta
you know if joe biden is president or
donald trump as president takes the oath
of office
whichever one on january 20th i am not
going to spend my days
you know debating or critiquing what
that president says what i am going to
do is do the best i can for the people
of the state of ohio
and governor and the governor what i'm
saying is as as governor of ohio you're
prepared to stand
against either president trump or joe
biden if they were to do something that
goes against the constitution that's
what you're telling
the people about absolutely well i
thought yeah eddie i thought they
think that was a question absolutely
i think people should know me i think
they should know what you know like
people can disagree about the
what we've done the virus they can
disagree about all kinds of things they
can think my position on this is wrong
my position is that
is wrong but no governor of the state is
going to stand up here
and say that you know or have any
intention i would hope
that we're not going to follow the
constitution the will the people will
prevail in the state of ohio the
electoral votes in ohio will be cast
for whoever gets the most votes in the
state of ohio i will guarantee you that
thank you next question is from max
philby at the columbus dispatch
afternoon governor max um so
experts are warning that child
immunizations are
way way way down this year because of
covet 19
and warning that that could lead to some
outbreaks of measles
and whooping cough and other things so
my question is today
does ohio have the resources to track
and contain
those kinds of outbreaks on top of covet
19.
well i thank you for the question we're
very concerned about this
uh we're very concerned about this there
is this
anti-vaccination movement
that i think is very misguided
we also add on top of that
that people because of the covet
have sometimes been reluctant to go to
their doctors so we are looking at
advertising about this messaging about
this
i will continue to say that you know go
to your doctor
take your kids get their shots
um so this is this is a real issue it's
something we're very concerned about
uh and that we're gonna continue to to
work on
and it's you know it's just it's just
very very
very important the people do that
next question is from jack windsor at
wmfd in mansfield
hey jack hi governor uh this question is
for you and uh
actually first for dr abbey uh and it's
how do you account
for people who were infected well before
july because you mentioned that immunity
can last three months or
easily uh be easily detected during
three months
uh pike county department of health says
they had the virus there in november
2019
a time that would account for close
indoor contact during thanksgiving
christmas
new year's celebrations and we were told
it was more contagious
early on so there are at least three
three-month intervals since that time
period during which
people could have contracted the virus
and the immunity could have gone from
strong prevalence easily detectable uh
like you said to some sort of immunity
that isn't
detectable now so how do you account for
those people who were in fact
infected previously and those topics get
covered in the report and then governor
are you now
saying that we are in for masking
distancing and quarantining for years
no i'll i'll go first um look
i i think the faster vaccine can get out
uh the better it is uh we have one
couple things going for us uh i think
that
the and this is the reason why people
don't want to get it
and should not want to get it and that
is
doctors have already gotten a lot better
keeping people alive
and bring them back to good health that
will only continue
i think we can expect that to continue
the ability to deal with this once you
have covet will get better
every every week uh at the sa at the
same at the same time
um you know the sooner we can get the
vaccines out
and the sooner people take them
you know again been some concern about
whether people will take the vaccines
but the sooner we can get
to that point i don't know what that
point is
but that's what we have to do um and
that's that's what we should do but i
can't put a date on it uh jack there's
no one that i don't think
any any specialist can put a date on
when we will be able to achieve what we
need to be able to achieve
um so i'm going to let the doctor answer
the uh
the other question on on on the study
yes great thank you for the question so
um
what i was saying about that three month
period is
um just something for everyone to keep
in mind if they get
a positive antibody test their screen
for covets for example they
they give blood and the ohio red cross
tells them that their antibody positive
that means that they most likely had
infection sometime in the last
three months it doesn't mean that they
had it exactly three months ago it means
that they had it sometime
in the last three months um and because
those are the same assays that we used
for this
study that was conducted in july it can
only give us
a more confident answer related to the
number of people that were exposed
to coronavirus are not exposed meaning
they they were at risk of disease but
who actually had infection
um in in in the three month period
before that
um how it relates to earlier in the
spring that this
this study i described today doesn't
tell us about those numbers because the
antibody assays
um don't capture infections that
occurred in that time period
and i'll also say um this is just one of
the surprises about cobit 19. so
so folks will know that cover 19 is
caused by sars co v2
and at first we were making a lot of
inferences about things like antibody
levels
from our experience with sars cov1 the
virus that caused
the original sars epidemic and for that
infection
people have antibodies that persist for
many months and even years and so the
assumption was these antibody tests
would give a longer
um picture a longer timeline of how many
people had been infected
and it's only been in the last few
months that there's more data showing
that in fact the
the time span is a bit shorter um to
answer your specific question
about cases uh for example in 2019 i'm
not aware of any plausible data that
shows that there was
circulating virus in ohio um in
in 2019 or or um and and if there were
cases in very early 2020 those
um only were as as folks probably know
only
determined after the fact um because of
course our first documented infections
were
were on march 9th of this year um
thank you next question is from tom
bosco
at wsyx in columbus
hi governor i want to ask you about
something i did a story on last week
when your public advisory map came out
last week delaware county moved
from uh level two to level three and
then this week they're back now
from level three to level two but last
week when they moved to level three the
delaware
general health district came out on
facebook and said hey look it's not that
bad
things are actually improving those
numbers are two weeks old
is what number and this is a question i
know that's been
kind of addressed since march probably
is what
number should people be looking at
to base their their daily act
on state numbers county numbers i i
understand that the map
is like a different set of numbers and
the county's got their daily case
numbers but what and is there a fear
that people will just look at the number
and cherry pick
the number they like when they want to
decide
how they're going to act in their
everyday lives
well excellent question i'm not aware of
what was going on with delaware i'll
find that out
where there was a discrepancy of how we
were looking at things i just don't
know what that was uh but from the
beginning
of this pandemic we've
proceeded under the assumption that one
of our jobs
or my jobs as governor is to get as many
facts out as we can
when you do that certainly people
compare
cherry pick as you say some of the
numbers
and people can read into it what they
want i would simply say
you know try to look at all the things
if you can only look at two things i
would say look at the
chart of of 88 counties that we put out
all the time
and that is this that is not history
that's two weeks back
so it tells you what's going on now in
your county
how many new cases have there been in
your county
um i would also look at the color code
and see again that is seven different
factors
including number of cases but at seven
it's seven different factors
um i think if you know if my county was
over a hundred
um in other words it's what
the experts say is high incidence i
would be concerned
uh but what people do whether in a
yellow county
or in orange county or red county
probably if you talk to health officials
the advice is going to be the same
be careful if you're really high risk
because of your age be even more careful
because you have you're diabetic because
you're obese
whatever that is you know be really
really cautious
everybody else wear a mask when you go
out
do everything you can to keep social
distancing don't be close to someone for
a very long period of time
because you don't know who has it and
who who doesn't have it so
i think what people should take from all
the information we're giving them
you know i i don't know that what they
really do every day
is going to be dramatically different i
think if i was in a county
um you know that's double
uh for example uh you know high
incidents over 200 for example um
you know it just it's it's an alert you
just have more problems and
your odds this is all about what your
odds are
because the problem is you don't know
who has it and who doesn't have it
generally
and many times they don't know so now
your question is of all the people i see
what's the you know
how many of them are going to have the
coven and we really don't know but you
know it's going to go up if these
numbers are up in the in the community
but
doing those basic things you know is is
takes all the guessing out of it
and seems to me that's what our message
frankly should be
thank you um today we have a video to
close featuring a hundred musicians from
the cleveland orchestra in the cleveland
orchestra
chorus uh they recorded parts of the
fourth movement of beethoven's
ninth symphony the ode to joy
in well-known locations in cleveland in
northeast ohio severance hall public
square
blossom music center progressive field
this year is the 250th anniversary of
beethoven's birth and i know that
pre-covered many performances of his
works
were planned the ode to joy is set to
the
words of schiller and german that all
people become brothers
