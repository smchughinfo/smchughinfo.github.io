    "what we're seeing frankly",
    "across the state it's these informal",
    "kind of get-togethers",
    "franklin county continues red this week",

    "minute montgomery county we're down to",

    "read this week in addition to community",
    "spread they've had outbreaks in",
    "long-term care facilities workplaces",
    "and again the family family gatherings",
    "so let's eric let's look at the top 10",
    "counties and again this is what we did",
    "we put these i asked our team to put",
    "these in order",
    "and you can pull those down from our",
    "webpage all",
    "one to 81 to 88 all counties",
    "ranked and again what this is to remind",
    "everybody",
    "every what happened in the last two",
    "weeks how many outbreaks",
    "but then it's it's reconfigured based on",
    "population",
    "so if you take it by population per per",
    "100",
    "000 population uh",
    "unfortunately mercer county is way up",
    "there at 262.",
    "you'll see lucas 189",
    "and if you look at these what is",
    "you know it's disturbing when you see",
    "any any county but what we're seeing",
    "is that the",
    "more urban counties where mask wearing",
    "is become",
    "very very very prevalent it's the norm",
    "now by far",
    "we're seeing a plateau and then starting",
    "to go down",
    "in many of the rural counties we're not",
    "seeing that as you see more of the",
    "orange counties in the map we showed a",
    "minute ago",
    "it's just spreading out into the rural",
    "counties and if you look at the top 10",
    "hottest counties unfortunately you know",
    "you go through these and there's some",
    "small counties in here",
    "mercer county has won wyandotte county",
    "champaign county hancock dark county",
    "fairfield erie uh so these are just",
    "no longer are they your big counties uh",
    "where the high concentration of people",
    "close together these are the more rural",
    "counties",
    "and it's a grave frankly grave concern",
    "to us let me just talk about you know",
    "a little bit about mercer county they're",
    "read for the first time this",
    "week they're showing an increase in",
    "patients in their emergency department",
    "which is worrisome according to local",
    "health officials",
    "now mercer county has had some",
    "significant",
    "big outbreaks you can go back way back",
    "way back in may an outbreak on a farm i",
    "think had",
    "80 cases um",
    "51 cases uh from from an event",
    "a funeral uh 33 of those individuals",
    "were actually from mercer county and",
    "brought it to mercer county",
    "but what's probably more significant",
    "or equally significant is that this has",
    "now spread to the community",
    "today uh the virus has spread all over",
    "mercer county",
    "other health officials tell us that's in",
    "all corners of the county and is",
    "affecting people of all ages so again",
    "my plea to my friends in mercer county",
    "as a wonderful",
    "wonderful county is we're a mask",
    "keep the distance is the only way we can",
    "slow this thing down and we just ask",
    "them to",
    "to please do that",
    "let's turn to athens county athens",
    "county",
    "some good news athens was on the watch",
    "list for risk of going red to purple",
    "highest level on the alert system they",
    "had several outbreaks of bars and",
    "restaurants",
    "and formal gatherings this week they're",
    "yellow",
    "and go all the way down to yellow their",
    "county health officials told us",
    "they're seeing many more people wearing",
    "masks they also said they're",
    "discouraging",
    "smaller gatherings and have encouraged",
    "people to limit their contact with",
    "others",
    "residents are doing what they can to",
    "protect themselves and others",
    "uh so that's just great uh staying home",
    "when they can",
    "hand washing social distancing wearing a",
    "mask so all these things for across the",
    "state of ohio or",
    "what we obviously uh need need to be",
    "doing",
    "uh next week we will be making some",
    "announcements",
    "at some point sometime next week",
    "lieutenant governor and i will be about",
    "sports in ohio",
    "we're going to talk a little bit about",
    "professional sports college sports uh",
    "and of great interest i know uh by the",
    "number of calls i get emails i get",
    "what we're doing about sports in in in",
    "in high school",
    "uh junior high and so we'll have",
    "guidance uh in regard to that",
    "um one of the things i let me just say",
    "and we'll talk more about this next week",
    "but when we talk about our students",
    "when we talk about our student athletes",
    "i truly believe that the schools are",
    "doing absolutely everything they can to",
    "protect our students whether an athlete",
    "or not an athlete whether",
    "whether they're in drama or whatever",
    "they're in i think",
    "whatever their interest is all the",
    "students",
    "our schools are getting ready and doing",
    "absolutely everything",
    "that they can one as i talk to",
    "superintendents",
    "one of one of the concerns is you know",
    "what",
    "young people do when they're not at",
    "school and again",
    "i think this is an opportunity for",
    "teachers it's an opportunity for the",
    "principals",
    "superintendents uh for those who are who",
    "are in athletics the coaches for those",
    "who are in other",
    "service clubs or other things whoever",
    "teacher is is running that",
    "uh and is in charge of that to talk",
    "really to the students",
    "about the rest of the day when they",
    "leave",
    "and how careful that they need to be",
    "one of the grave concerns that we have",
    "is",
    "schools open back up that we have people",
    "who are vulnerable",
    "it may be someone and maybe a child it",
    "may be a child at home",
    "it may be an adult at home maybe a",
    "diabetic father",
    "maybe a mom who has some other medical",
    "problems maybe a grandparent that's",
    "living in the home",
    "and so for those students when they go",
    "home to be very very very careful",
    "uh and to you know",
    "not just when they're going home but",
    "when they're out",
    "with their friends uh you know to wear a",
    "mask",
    "to be careful uh because the people who",
    "are really vulnerable",
    "uh are the ones who have a medical",
    "condition now it would be same way in in",
    "the schools i know our superintendents",
    "are working very hard at principals",
    "teachers everyone to try to figure out",
    "if there's a teacher or someone who has",
    "a medical problem",
    "custodian someone else how best to",
    "help them and to isolate them maybe or",
    "in some way protect them",
    "so we are all all in this together",
    "but i i really believe that uh",
    "what teachers what coaches what others",
    "say to their students over the next few",
    "weeks",
    "is really going to determine to to a",
    "great extent you know how well we do and",
    "if we're able to go back to school",
    "because",
    "i think the schools will do do it well i",
    "think students will do it well in school",
    "the question is when they get out",
    "and they're more relaxed in formal",
    "situations and social situations",
    "are are they being careful and it's just",
    "very very very important",
    "let me give you a update in regard to",
    "tracing",
    "tracing is run by 113 health departments",
    "around",
    "the state of ohio uh we are working very",
    "closely with them we have",
    "extra tracers that we we have hired and",
    "employed",
    "they can surge in for example in mercer",
    "county we have some who",
    "who are helping there in some other",
    "counties",
    "but one of the things that we're been",
    "trying to do is get",
    "better data and so i was asked last week",
    "in a question to provide some additional",
    "data about contact tracing and the",
    "outbreaks and the",
    "stories and where the stories came from",
    "that we've been sharing",
    "i've talked to our team at the",
    "department of health",
    "data related to outbreak outbreaks is",
    "frankly under the current system at the",
    "department of health not very easy to",
    "get",
    "through the ohio disease reporting",
    "system or the ohio contact racing system",
    "and let me talk a little bit about why",
    "that is",
    "and then about what we're doing to help",
    "neither system was designed to pull data",
    "out either system was",
    "designed to data mine which we all just",
    "take for granted",
    "that we want to be able to do and so i",
    "know",
    "some of my friends in the press have",
    "asked for information that we've not",
    "been able to provide",
    "they may be frustrated i am even more",
    "frustrated because i'm asking questions",
    "every day about where we're seeing",
    "outbreaks and information",
    "and so the data systems that we have one",
    "of the systems is 19",
    "years old when it was designed",
    "i'm sure it was state of the art then",
    "but certainly it's not state of the art",
    "now it does not do everything we want it",
    "to do",
    "this is an example of uh frankly the",
    "decades under funding of public health",
    "uh and when this is all over uh you know",
    "as we look to the future now as we look",
    "to the future",
    "we've got to do a better job and frankly",
    "invest more in public health the federal",
    "level the state level and at the local",
    "level",
    "and my commitment is that we will we",
    "will do that and we are doing that",
    "the ohio disease reporting system for",
    "example",
    "was designed to look at outbreaks by",
    "broad categories",
    "is it foodborne or is it hospital",
    "acquired",
    "and not by setting it doesn't index",
    "outbreaks based on the exact kind of",
    "business setting",
    "such as a bar or restaurant or a grocery",
    "store it doesn't tell us that",
    "that information is generally entered by",
    "local health departments in a field that",
    "isn't easily searchable",
    "and isn't always entered the same way",
    "uh consequently we aren't able to pull a",
    "comprehensive list of outbreaks by",
    "specific setting",
    "what we do do is",
    "kind of bypass that system and go",
    "directly to the health departments and",
    "try to get",
    "as much information as we can about what",
    "is occurring",
    "and where the outbreaks are occurring uh",
    "out in the community and you can tell",
    "every week when i talk about that we've",
    "we've pulled some of that down",
    "the stories that we talk about every",
    "week are anecdotal stories",
    "uh that we have collected from the local",
    "health departments we know it's",
    "incomplete but it does",
    "help i think provide a clearer picture",
    "of what is going on",
    "additionally these stories often give us",
    "more detailed information about an",
    "outbreak and demonstrates the true",
    "spread of the virus",
    "let me now now go on",
    "um",
    "let me keep us moving here",
    "um eric let's pull up",
    "dr peter muller who is coming up",
    "we are pleased today to have dr peter",
    "mohler jonas",
    "he is the chief scientific officer for",
    "the ohio state university wexner",
    "medical center and vice dean for",
    "research at the u.s",
    "osu college of medicine dr mueller has",
    "been working with our team for the past",
    "few months",
    "to help us on our testing strategy we're",
    "grateful for his work and expertise",
    "we're grateful for him being here today",
    "doctor thank you",
    "uh for for joining us and i wonder if",
    "you could just",
    "talk a little bit about the different",
    "tests because i know that",
    "what happened with me yesterday uh has",
    "caused some questions and people are",
    "asking",
    "asking about it my understanding is that",
    "i was given",
    "up in cleveland at case in antigen",
    "test later on at ohio state i was taken",
    "i was given a pcr test and i wonder if",
    "you can maybe start off and just kind of",
    "explain",
    "uh what those differences are and",
    "anything you think that we should know",
    "yeah absolutely so first thanks governor",
    "for having me on today",
    "and certainly science is complex and",
    "testing is is equally as complex and so",
    "i'm going to break these into two",
    "different categories of testing and and",
    "equate them to",
    "a high power telescope and a pair of",
    "binoculars and so i'm going to first",
    "focus on the high power telescope so",
    "so when we think about the testing that",
    "we've typically been doing across",
    "ohio we call that pcr testing and this",
    "is an incredibly sensitive",
    "and incredibly accurate it's like a big",
    "telescope",
    "way to look at the virus it actually",
    "looks at the genetic makeup of the virus",
    "looking at the rna",
    "and amplifies it so even a very small",
    "miniscule bit of the virus can be",
    "amplified",
    "and because of that it can be very",
    "sensitive the advantages obviously are",
    "we can detect very low viral loads in",
    "people that may be",
    "either symptomatic or asymptomatic and",
    "it",
    "and and we have the ability to to be",
    "able to look at this over time",
    "the the disadvantages obviously are",
    "things like you know it's hard to scale",
    "this it's hard to have",
    "lots of different high-powered",
    "telescopes across the country across the",
    "state",
    "um it takes a certain type of person to",
    "be able to run them that has had",
    "training",
    "but when we get a result from the pcr",
    "test",
    "similar to looking at a star with a high",
    "power telescope you get a very good",
    "impression of what's happening at that",
    "at that level now i'm going to contrast",
    "that",
    "in a second with with with the antigen",
    "test the test that you had yesterday so",
    "very similar to a pair of binoculars",
    "you're able to look",
    "maybe not at the level that you would",
    "look at with the pcr test so the antigen",
    "test",
    "and that doesn't look at the genetic",
    "material it actually looks at the",
    "the protein on the surface of a of the",
    "virus",
    "um so it's a little bit less sensitive",
    "and so you're going to have things that",
    "we call",
    "false negatives and false positives like",
    "binoculars",
    "you're going to miss some stars but the",
    "good part is you're going to be able to",
    "have",
    "lots of these across the field and the",
    "key point of what we call",
    "point of care testing which these enable",
    "is that",
    "you can find out results within 15 or 20",
    "minutes",
    "and so for the epidemiologists of the",
    "world you're allowed",
    "you're very quickly able to do contact",
    "tracing",
    "be able to quarantine people and be able",
    "to make decisions on health care",
    "with all of these tests though it's",
    "important that we understand their",
    "strengths and limitations and so",
    "in the case of anagen testing which is a",
    "newer type of testing to the state",
    "we want to make sure that before we",
    "would roll this out for our state labs",
    "we would understand really the the the",
    "benefits of doing it and and also some",
    "of the",
    "some of the the disadvantages so in the",
    "state you know we've done almost",
    "1.6 a million um tests using the pcr",
    "test so we know",
    "really a lot about it we're very",
    "familiar with the strengths and",
    "weaknesses",
    "with the anagen test it's still a new",
    "technology we're getting to learn on it",
    "um",
    "you know we've been empowered by your",
    "team to be able to to really study it to",
    "figure out",
    "how it's going to work best for the",
    "citizens of ohio and how to implement it",
    "as part of our strategy",
    "well thank you very much",
    "[Music]",
    "are there other quick things that you",
    "might call a quick",
    "test that are a pcr test",
    "right so so we've often heard and and",
    "i'm excuse me i guess the question you",
    "know i think the assumption might be",
    "that",
    "every quick test is the same and so",
    "maybe if you could just kind of explain",
    "that to us a little bit yeah that's a",
    "that's a great question governor so",
    "there's there's two types of quick quick",
    "tests and these are tests that can be",
    "done sort of in 15 or 20 minutes",
    "the first that i just mentioned is this",
    "anagen test and basically it's a swab of",
    "your throw to your nose",
    "and gets put in this machine and says",
    "yes or no",
    "the other way though is we've heard that",
    "a lot about these abbot point-of-care",
    "tests so this is still a molecular test",
    "like the pcr test",
    "um detecting the rna or the dna of the",
    "of the",
    "of the virus and this is often done like",
    "right now in the emergency",
    "emergency departments as a way to really",
    "triage",
    "uh triage cases it's still a very",
    "accurate test but not quite as accurate",
    "as what we would do",
    "in a clia lab like we were doing here at",
    "the wexner medical center with patel",
    "so if you had to rank those then then",
    "rank them in in the order of the the",
    "most accurate yes sir so we would",
    "we would call the gold standard to be",
    "the pcr test and this would be the test",
    "that",
    "was done twice on you last evening and",
    "again this is going to be the",
    "the one that gets at the very detailed",
    "detailed look at the",
    "dna or the armies of the big and doctor",
    "let me interrupt",
    "that's the test that for virtually",
    "everybody who's watching this who has",
    "had a test",
    "in ohio they probably have had a pcr",
    "test yeah right so the the",
    "vast majority well over 90 percent of",
    "the of the people that have been tested",
    "in ohio have used",
    "the pcr giant giant telescope tester and",
    "this is",
    "standard and and i would say even beyond",
    "that it's the best",
    "and most accurate test right now in the",
    "world",
    "okay i interrupted you you started that",
    "that test",
    "gold standard then what would be next as",
    "far as accuracy",
    "right so you would probably put next",
    "your point of care",
    "abbott id type of test that you would",
    "get tested in the",
    "in the emergency room still quite",
    "accurate a little bit faster",
    "in fact quite a bit faster than the pcr",
    "test it takes",
    "sometimes hours and and we've seen some",
    "backlogs of days",
    "um and then next to that governor below",
    "that would be",
    "some of these things with like the the",
    "antigen test that you took yesterday",
    "morning so",
    "again very fast pretty accurate",
    "but again not quite as accurate as the",
    "pcr test that you took",
    "last night now we've been talking doctor",
    "um with a company that is",
    "been done doing more talking we've",
    "entered a contract with them",
    "a company that uses saliva uh it's a",
    "california company that's livo",
    "it is it's can be administered the",
    "advantage it has",
    "uh is a number of people it's",
    "self-administered for people who can do",
    "that",
    "uh and you could do it in a group and",
    "people would do it and then it",
    "gets mailed to california comes back",
    "where does",
    "what kind of test is that if you know",
    "yes sir so",
    "so specimen collection and this would be",
    "whether it's saliva",
    "or a nasal swab is really really",
    "irrelevant",
    "in terms of what test it uses but but",
    "but typically what we're doing in ohio",
    "is is is pcr-based again this very very",
    "accurate test",
    "that that gets at the the very small",
    "pieces of dna and rna",
    "the other thing governor that i if you",
    "don't mind me mentioning is that",
    "we're beginning to start pilot processes",
    "to be able to do what's called pool",
    "testing",
    "and so this is this process of being",
    "able to look at samples together",
    "because the technology has advanced in a",
    "way that we can",
    "measure very sensitive amounts of dna or",
    "rna",
    "we may be able to put 5 10 or even",
    "15 samples together and and the benefit",
    "of that we've heard a lot about issues",
    "with supply chain",
    "we've seen a lot of issues with",
    "turnaround times this will allow us to",
    "save reagents",
    "to speed up our our turnaround times and",
    "really to be able to",
    "change the way we test as a state and",
    "really redefine our testing strategy",
    "which is exciting",
    "well it is exciting and doctor i first",
    "found out about this was i was on a call",
    "with the vice president",
    "uh probably three four weeks ago and",
    "they talk about pool testing i know what",
    "they're talking about",
    "uh then i found out talk with you um",
    "and so if anyone's not familiar with the",
    "pool testing and correct me if i'm",
    "wrong doctor but you could take let's",
    "say you took four people or five people",
    "you put them in your test you put them",
    "all together you tested them uh if it",
    "comes out negative",
    "you've cleared five people now if it",
    "comes up positive",
    "then you gotta go back and and and take",
    "that samples you already have and do",
    "that testing but",
    "in a state like ohio where we're now",
    "running about 5.5",
    "or 5.6 something like that percent",
    "positivity",
    "it probably makes a lot of sense um if",
    "you're out there with",
    "certainly with people who don't have",
    "symptoms it would make make a lot of",
    "sense to do that i would think",
    "yes sir in fact if you're looking at",
    "asymptomatics",
    "where where right now you know if you",
    "think about a prevalence of less than",
    "two percent or even one percent it might",
    "even allow you to save about",
    "eighty percent of your testing capacity",
    "expanding one to five or one to ten so",
    "it's really uh",
    "it's something that's that's going to be",
    "a game changer and then the really great",
    "part",
    "is a lot of that innovation that has",
    "pushed that is happening right here in",
    "ohio and whether it's",
    "creation of new protocols to be able to",
    "do this partnerships with companies to",
    "be able to allow us to",
    "to move forward or or even relationships",
    "that that you and the lieutenant",
    "governor have set us up with with the",
    "cdc and the fda as well as the white",
    "house",
    "have allowed us to really get out in",
    "front of this as a state",
    "well doctor thanks for everything you've",
    "done thanks for coming in today we may",
    "need you",
    "for some questions that i can't answer",
    "but uh",
    "we appreciate it thanks for what you do",
    "every day for ohio",
    "thank you just like just like to thank",
    "all the people in the labs that are",
    "doing these testing",
    "tests every day it's it's it's a it's a",
    "huge huge effort",
    "and uh they're they're working very hard",
    "and they're working hard all over the",
    "state so we we're very grateful",
    "that thanks doctor thank you very much",
    "let me turn to",
    "uh lieutenant governor hello governor",
    "uh yeah great to great to",
    "be with you in a video connect today",
    "we're used to doing this uh",
    "in the same room but we're we're apart",
    "today we've we've done these news",
    "conferences in a variety of settings in",
    "a variety of different ways and it",
    "continues to",
    "to evolve but i wanted to give a we know",
    "that uh",
    "people across the state are paying",
    "attention to what's happening with",
    "schools",
    "and and schools are preparing to to go",
    "back",
    "and parents and students are in",
    "anticipation",
    "uh while many of them uh want to do it",
    "in person",
    "there are some schools who are going to",
    "open either a hybrid model or",
    "in distance learning uh and and there",
    "are also we also know that even",
    "schools that are going back five days",
    "there are some students who",
    "either themselves or their families are",
    "immunocompromised and so",
    "distance learning is a really important",
    "component",
    "of what's going to happen in ohio during",
    "the course of",
    "of the year and we announced a couple",
    "weeks ago of a",
    "a 50 million dollar grant program",
    "that we were putting together to help",
    "schools",
    "to help support schools in the cost of",
    "providing services to those students who",
    "either don't have access to the internet",
    "that they that they maybe can't afford",
    "it uh there are a variety of",
    "reasons that students struggle to to",
    "connect with distance learning",
    "and uh we're gonna be uh rolling out",
    "applications for that grant starting on",
    "on monday august the 10th that's when",
    "when student or when schools",
    "can start applying reminder this is for",
    "home internet hot spots cellular enabled",
    "devices",
    "public wi-fi and mobile public wi-fi",
    "services again we're targeting those",
    "vulnerable populations of people who are",
    "living in poverty maybe",
    "maybe have chronic health conditions or",
    "no internet access",
    "a little change from where we started",
    "this conversation two weeks ago we",
    "listened we had a lot of schools that",
    "said",
    "because we set it up as a matching",
    "program those schools many of them",
    "couldn't find the resources to do this",
    "as a matching program so we've",
    "we've discontinued the matching",
    "requirement uh",
    "we're going to target you know we only",
    "we have 50 million dollars it's a lot of",
    "money",
    "but it's not going to be enough to",
    "probably serve everyone so we will",
    "uh target it to those who who need it",
    "the most uh the application period um",
    "well i mentioned the application period",
    "but i also want to say that this will",
    "cover",
    "purchases that schools made starting",
    "july 1st",
    "so if they've already made these",
    "purchases you're not going to be",
    "punished for being proactive you're",
    "still eligible to have some of those",
    "costs",
    "recouped if you've made them since july",
    "1st",
    "the application period will be open",
    "through friday august the 21st",
    "and then the schools will be notified of",
    "their awards on",
    "the week of august the 31st all right",
    "while this is not live yet to apply we",
    "will have it up by the end of the day",
    "governor we're going to put this on your",
    "social media accounts the the",
    "site address and my social media",
    "accounts it's going to be in ohio dash",
    "k12 dot help forward slash broadband",
    "ohio",
    "dash connectivity dash grant that's a",
    "long web address so that's why we're",
    "gonna",
    "we're gonna post it out there so people",
    "can can find it",
    "and see it and been able to access to do",
    "those applications",
    "another thing that we have done to help",
    "schools so that they don't have to go",
    "out and try to",
    "purchase this stuff all on their own",
    "we've done a request for information",
    "we've had 12 companies so far respond",
    "to that which will which publicly will",
    "will show us the prices that they're",
    "going to offer for schools and students",
    "this is available at",
    "procure.ohio.gov",
    "again to get into the detail of this",
    "where all these prices are on this big",
    "website we're going to post that that",
    "data out on your social media",
    "and my social media so that everybody",
    "can see",
    "what the prices are so we're getting the",
    "best deal",
    "make this money go as far as it can for",
    "the students",
    "and the schools make this 50 million",
    "dollars and the other",
    "the other money that the schools are",
    "putting into this go further",
    "we're trying uh we're all pitching in",
    "here",
    "school's going back in a variety of ways",
    "we know that",
    "we've talked about this on the on the",
    "news conferences before",
    "you know when we get into the winter",
    "we're expecting that that this might",
    "this virus might get tough tougher than",
    "it is now so we know",
    "that preparing these students in schools",
    "for the future of potentially having to",
    "do distance learning is important and",
    "these monies have been set aside and",
    "these prices",
    "are now being published publicly so that",
    "we can get the best deals possible and",
    "make sure",
    "that if you have to do distance learning",
    "that you can do distance learning",
    "so with that governor i'll kick it back",
    "to you",
    "look that's very exciting as we all know",
    "the kids",
    "we worry about all our kids we worry",
    "about kids particularly if if school",
    "can't be in person",
    "kids having the ability to get to the",
    "internet uh is so vitally important so",
    "we're excited about this program john",
    "thanks for",
    "for heading heading this up and and",
    "taking the lead in it",
    "we're ready for questions governor your",
    "first question today is from uh",
    "john reed at goneware news service",
    "good afternoon governor um i'm glad",
    "you're doing well",
    "as you know congress is still working on",
    "the next relief package stimulus bill",
    "is there anything in particular that",
    "you've been lobbying to include in that",
    "bill and",
    "would you like to see a further increase",
    "in federal share of medicaid spending",
    "well medicaid spending is is a huge",
    "issue",
    "for us because if things are not changed",
    "there's a cliff out there",
    "that we're going to get to at some point",
    "so yes we like that",
    "medicaid side we want to make sure",
    "you know we have enough funds for the",
    "testing",
    "to get through this uh testing is is not",
    "cheap",
    "uh we're doing everything we can to keep",
    "the cost down we're building up our own",
    "infrastructure in ohio which saves",
    "certainly saves money and and we can",
    "also control it",
    "but the level of our testing needs to go",
    "up even more dramatically than it",
    "already has",
    "so the testing and again the flexibility",
    "flexibility for our local communities",
    "for our local mayors our local counties",
    "and for us is just is just vitally",
    "important so",
    "i'm an optimist i think they'll get",
    "something worked out uh you know",
    "i spent some time in washington i",
    "understand how it works and",
    "sometimes doesn't work uh but uh i i",
    "think something will get worked out",
    "and uh we'll we'll keep moving",
    "you know we also have the other",
    "unemployment extension uh",
    "you know we've got people who are out",
    "there who are really going to be hurting",
    "unless something",
    "some compromise gets worked out and",
    "something gets passed so",
    "thank you our next question is from ben",
    "schwartz at wcpo in cincinnati",
    "good afternoon governor dewine happy to",
    "hear you in good health",
    "um i'm wondering though if you can",
    "comment on the ordeal that you went",
    "through yesterday",
    "and how it makes you think about average",
    "ohioans who have gone",
    "through much more to be tested for covet",
    "19",
    "um it seems like you were in a lucky",
    "position to be able to be",
    "retested and go from a positive test to",
    "negative",
    "in the same day and most ohioans don't",
    "have that luxury",
    "i know you spoke today about progress in",
    "testing but i'd like to know if",
    "yesterday's ordeal",
    "has had much of an effect on how you",
    "view it in the state",
    "well sure no one can go through that",
    "experience without uh",
    "having some impact on you and you know",
    "you think about",
    "uh you know anybody that that goes goes",
    "through that",
    "it's it was a roller coaster yesterday",
    "uh ben the only thing i",
    "i would point out though is that the",
    "majority of ohioans",
    "we don't know the exact number but well",
    "over 90 the test that they got",
    "was the pcr test which is the test i",
    "ended up with at ohio state",
    "uh and so what it does say to me",
    "uh having to you know drill down on the",
    "difference between these two tests",
    "and understand it better is that when we",
    "deploy",
    "uh an antigen test you know we gotta",
    "think long and hard exactly how we're",
    "gonna deploy it uh",
    "and you know it has certain advantages",
    "we know what the advantages are",
    "but we also know the reliability is not",
    "nearly as good uh as as the pcr",
    "test that most ohioans have had so you",
    "know we've entered into an agreement uh",
    "with with maryland and other states to",
    "start looking at this and and but",
    "um it's a conversation frankly i'm gonna",
    "have with governor hogan i",
    "i meant to call him this morning ran out",
    "of time and we'll call him later today",
    "uh you know so you learn look you learn",
    "every experience in life you learn and",
    "so going through that experience",
    "yesterday",
    "pushed my head down right in it and said",
    "hey you know let's look at this",
    "reliability of this test so yeah",
    "our next question is from laura bischoff",
    "at the dayton daily news",
    "uh hey governor um i was wondering if",
    "you could give us an update on the",
    "random sample test that um i think dr",
    "acton talked about maybe as far back as",
    "april this was to check on what",
    "percentage of the population might have",
    "the antibodies",
    "did that ever get off the ground um",
    "it it did it's been another an area of",
    "frustration that didn't move faster uh",
    "laura i don't have that today",
    "but we'll we can get that to you after",
    "the press conference and i'll get it to",
    "everybody",
    "to be available to anybody else in the",
    "press corps",
    "after the press conference we've got",
    "that we can tell you exactly",
    "where exactly that is i just can't do it",
    "now",
    "i don't have it in front of me so thank",
    "you",
    "thank you next question is from jack",
    "windsor at wmfd",
    "in mansfield hi governor uh i'm grateful",
    "for",
    "answered prayers today sir i'm glad",
    "you're well thank you",
    "you're welcome uh lengthy question",
    "please bear with me uh",
    "if i told someone the breaks in a car",
    "may go out thirty to sixty percent of",
    "the time",
    "i don't know many people who would get",
    "in uh if we told someone that an",
    "airplane would experience failure 15 to",
    "20",
    "of the time i don't know anyone who",
    "would get on a flight yet",
    "tests are the vehicle carrying kids into",
    "person schooling",
    "sports and adults to work and business",
    "owners to revenue",
    "yet as yesterday proved antigen tests",
    "have false positives",
    "and if i remember correctly this is the",
    "type of test earlier in the week",
    "we talked about vying to administer in",
    "the future",
    "and according to the knox county",
    "department of health antigen tests can",
    "return",
    "false results 30 to 66 of the time",
    "and pcr tests the one seen as more",
    "reliable can have anywhere from 15 to 20",
    "false results and are so sensitive that",
    "they can",
    "report positives up to three months",
    "after the fact and well after someone is",
    "contagious",
    "yet tests continue to be the primary",
    "driver to public policy",
    "and these faulty tests are putting kids",
    "in compromised learning environments",
    "driving up suicides",
    "drug abuse and depression while wiping",
    "out businesses by the thousands governor",
    "is it simply time to admit that we",
    "bought a lemon and it's causing more",
    "harm",
    "uh this this mechanism than the virus",
    "and is it time to free ohioans so we can",
    "get back to normal life",
    "okay i'm going to reference over to dr",
    "peter moeller who i",
    "believe is still on eric if he's still",
    "on",
    "and i'll just start first of all you",
    "know we didn't choose the test",
    "the antigen test again is not something",
    "that we're",
    "uh using uh this it certainly has not",
    "been so",
    "far part of our overall strategy uh we",
    "have",
    "looked at it uh as a possibility uh in",
    "the future",
    "but the p the standard pcr test is the",
    "gold standard",
    "and you know i will disagree with you at",
    "least but i'm going to let uh",
    "the doctor answer the question in regard",
    "to what the you know",
    "how good how good",
    "he talked about the antigen test but the",
    "pcr test how good that is dr mueller are",
    "you on here",
    "yes sir i'm i'm still on uh you want you",
    "want again kind of give us the",
    "uh you know how accurate is is the pcr",
    "test",
    "as far as we can tell what do you know",
    "what's the data",
    "as well as the and then do the anagen",
    "test sure",
    "sure so absolutely so i think that the",
    "first and foremost that that you know a",
    "year ago we weren't",
    "we weren't testing anything and the",
    "science is moving",
    "incredibly quickly um pcr has been",
    "around for",
    "20 to 30 years and that technology is",
    "is tried and true we know the sequences",
    "of the virus we know the sequences of",
    "specifically of this virus and how it",
    "changes and we've been able to design",
    "these tests so they're almost a hundred",
    "percent",
    "so i would probably challenge you on",
    "your number of your",
    "your accuracy of your your pcr data that",
    "you just brought up",
    "now antigen testing is brand new um",
    "brand new there's two",
    "manufacturers that make it and we're",
    "still learning and i would say",
    "um you know i don't work for the state",
    "um",
    "but but i will tell you that when we're",
    "looking at tests to use for strategies",
    "whether it's here at ohio state",
    "or with my colleagues at other state",
    "universities",
    "we follow the data and before we would",
    "employ something into our testing",
    "strategies",
    "we look exactly at the questions that",
    "you asked you know what is",
    "you know what is the benefit of using",
    "this test what are the risks of using",
    "this test",
    "are we putting people in a false sense",
    "of security by telling them things and",
    "so",
    "those are all areas that we deploy and",
    "there's",
    "not just one person that looks at this",
    "there's hundreds of people that look at",
    "this we look at this in peer-reviewed",
    "literature",
    "and ultimately come to conclusions about",
    "how do we want to change our strategy",
    "and how do we want to evolve i will also",
    "add at the end",
    "is that we continue to work on ways to",
    "improve testing",
    "ways that we can make sure that our pcr",
    "testing is",
    "is expanded so we can include more",
    "numbers ways that we can take an antigen",
    "test",
    "and make it more accurate so all of this",
    "is evolving in real time it's it's",
    "exciting time to be a scientist and but",
    "we need to come up with solutions",
    "where there's data behind them okay",
    "thank you very much thanks jack",
    "our next question is uh from uh",
    "furniture miri at the associated press",
    "hi governor thanks again um for taking",
    "the time today to talk to us",
    "um my question is um i",
    "have spoke actually this morning to the",
    "manufacturer",
    "um who administered the test that you",
    "took yesterday",
    "before you went and met president trump",
    "and they told us that it has a hundred",
    "percent",
    "specificity rate and the fda says it has",
    "a 97",
    "sensitivity rate so according to",
    "those numbers that's as good as pcr so",
    "what are the chances that",
    "the test results that you took yesterday",
    "and afternoon the two tests that you",
    "took",
    "are a false negative well i'm i'm a",
    "biased observer so i'm going to go back",
    "to dr peter muller and let him answer",
    "the question",
    "he's a lot more qualified than i am to",
    "answer the question and i'm the subject",
    "so",
    "i'm probably not very very biased i sort",
    "of like the negative result but",
    "doctor so i obviously can't comment on",
    "the governor's specific case but i will",
    "tell you that",
    "that um if you were to ask a thousand",
    "people that",
    "are in my line of work which is the more",
    "specific and accurate test that all 1000",
    "of them would",
    "would tell you that the pcr test that we",
    "ran last night",
    "is by far more accurate and in fact we",
    "did",
    "we ran it twice so we would ran on a",
    "duplicate",
    "piece of equipment and got the same same",
    "information and so",
    "we we uh we we fully um",
    "stand by the data that we we created",
    "last night",
    "thank you thanks our next question is",
    "from jeff redick at wsyx in columbus",
    "hi governor thanks for the opportunity",
    "even from afar today",
    "uh you mentioned earlier about the",
    "state's equipment for public health",
    "reporting and data and that one of those",
    "is coming up on two decades old which",
    "obviously a computer from",
    "2000 is a lot different than 2020. uh",
    "how did it get",
    "so old why is there no process or is",
    "there",
    "to update this equipment clearly it's",
    "needed and what we have is",
    "underperforming as you said",
    "i think the answer is pretty simple we",
    "have ignored as a people",
    "democrats republicans we've ignored",
    "public health",
    "we've got to stop ignoring public health",
    "this ought to be a real wake-up call for",
    "us",
    "we've got to understand the the role of",
    "public health",
    "uh you know we have people out there and",
    "113 health departments every day and you",
    "never think about them unless something",
    "goes wrong",
    "uh you know they're the ones that are",
    "out there to make sure that we're safe",
    "make sure everything is going right and",
    "what's going right we never think",
    "a thing about it so it is a focus",
    "on public health uh when i hire dr acton",
    "one things i said to her is we've got to",
    "start focusing on public health",
    "had had no idea of course that we were",
    "going to be in",
    "into a pandemic so we got to fix these",
    "systems we got to get them up to date",
    "look we don't we can't even tell you the",
    "health department can't even tell you",
    "today",
    "uh the number of flu deaths that we have",
    "now it's just ridiculous i mean you know",
    "all this data we just got to get better",
    "data",
    "we've got to get it built into the",
    "system",
    "and part of the reason it's difficult",
    "you know is you're relying on",
    "so many in you know decentralized state",
    "like ohio you're",
    "relying not only 113 health departments",
    "you're relying on 88 county coroner's",
    "offices",
    "you're relying on a lot of a lot of",
    "different inputs",
    "and so we've got to design a system",
    "which we will uh for the 21st century",
    "so we we we are in the product we've",
    "done a lot",
    "uh in the last four or five months we",
    "weren't even integrated very well",
    "if at all with the hospitals we're now",
    "integrated so we can show you data up",
    "here",
    "about hospital admissions uh et cetera",
    "so we've come a long way but we we still",
    "have a long way to go",
    "our next question is from joshua",
    "roltenberg at spectrum news",
    "governor glad you're doing well um",
    "question i have for you",
    "it was actually goes back to an earlier",
    "question you were already asked but",
    "talking about your ordeal yesterday",
    "um are you worried just about the",
    "perception of",
    "your results getting back as fast as",
    "possible versus",
    "average ohioans who sometimes have to",
    "wait days and sometimes weeks",
    "and also this my follow-up another",
    "question i have is",
    "if the president is using these antigen",
    "tests which the doctor ranked as the",
    "lowest",
    "is he not getting the best information",
    "himself",
    "for the people that are around him yeah",
    "well first of all",
    "sure i i'm concerned about that",
    "perception",
    "um you know we made a decision that i",
    "was either",
    "as the governor of the state uh going to",
    "be confined uh",
    "here and limited to what i could do uh",
    "for 14 days",
    "uh or we'd try another test uh and so we",
    "we did another test that was based upon",
    "the medical advice",
    "dr andy thomas um and so we got another",
    "test and yes we did get it back quick",
    "um so i i agree with that",
    "um again the vast",
    "majority of ohioans 1.3 million tests",
    "have been run",
    "you know virtually not over 90 of those",
    "are in pcr tests that i had last night",
    "and there would be no reason that i",
    "think medical professionals would doubt",
    "the outcome of that test so the test",
    "that we took",
    "medical professionals they told me we",
    "doubt you know we don't know if that's",
    "accurate",
    "it's probably accurate it's what they",
    "told me it's probably right",
    "but you probably ought to go to the gold",
    "standard let's go get a let's go get the",
    "gold standard test the piece",
    "the pcr our our test",
    "i don't know my understanding is",
    "and i don't know all the facts but the",
    "republican national committee apparently",
    "contracted with somebody to do this",
    "testing",
    "they did the testing i do not",
    "think but i don't know i think what the",
    "white house does at the white house is a",
    "different",
    "test uh but i don't i can't swear to",
    "that but that's what i've been",
    "told that is a different test at the",
    "white house if you go see the president",
    "the white house",
    "my understanding is a more gold standard",
    "test",
    "uh than this test but i'm sure that",
    "enterprising reporters you you guys will",
    "figure that out and",
    "report it i just don't know i don't know",
    "the answer",
    "governor it's john uh houston i got i",
    "got a little report back",
    "from on laura bischoff's question uh",
    "the department of health has completed",
    "their sampling for this",
    "serology testing to determine whether",
    "someone has antibodies",
    "uh that would that would help us",
    "understand better uh how how many people",
    "may have had uh covet 19",
    "that those should have preliminary",
    "results in in a few weeks",
    "with a final report in early september",
    "uh and so we'll be very interested to",
    "see what",
    "what happens there i will i will pers i",
    "will also remind",
    "folks that the american red cross",
    "has been doing these",
    "uh tests when someone donates blood",
    "and the results have",
    "varied from week to week but they are in",
    "the range of 1.4 to 1.8 percent of",
    "people who give blood",
    "who have these antibodies so it's uh",
    "it's a",
    "based on that data it's a small number",
    "of people when you consider it as the",
    "overall population but we will the",
    "department of health will have",
    "those that data back and and have a",
    "report by early september",
    "good lieutenant governor thank you",
    "thank you your next question is from jim",
    "province of the toledo blade",
    "governor it's good to see you could you",
    "give us an idea of what kind of test it",
    "is that the",
    "state has entered a multi-state",
    "purchasing agreement with",
    "is that this california company and is",
    "this test similar",
    "to the one that you took in cleveland",
    "also do we have any idea what kind of",
    "cost is associated with this purchase",
    "we have not entered into any contract",
    "what we've simply done",
    "is gone together as states and",
    "bound together to to work together to be",
    "able to purchase",
    "i think this type test is one of the",
    "tests",
    "that we've been looking at some of our",
    "people have talked to",
    "um both of these companies that do it",
    "uh but as i said earlier uh",
    "you know we dig down further and uh this",
    "is something i'm gonna talk to uh",
    "governor hogan of maryland and the other",
    "governors uh",
    "about and you know again this is",
    "something that",
    "we will rely on the professionals uh",
    "in ohio uh to make it not not just from",
    "the health department but outside the",
    "health department to see",
    "if a test like this you know does it",
    "have a place",
    "and uh you know again looking at this",
    "and looking at",
    "the the false positives and the false",
    "negatives and i'm",
    "an example of one of the false positives",
    "that would appear",
    "certainly would cause us to take a",
    "second look and a third look at this",
    "so we will keep you informed and if",
    "if we get to the point where we're going",
    "to enter into a contract we certainly",
    "will",
    "let you know what the cost is i mean we",
    "are one of the things i",
    "i would just let everybody know uh",
    "this testing is is essential part",
    "of what we do it's not as important",
    "frankly as as",
    "distancing it's not as important wearing",
    "masks but it goes with everything",
    "um we gotta we gotta cut this thing off",
    "and the only way you do it is with",
    "testing and tracing",
    "so we have explored a lot of",
    "possibilities",
    "a lot of different companies",
    "we are in the process of building our",
    "own system",
    "uh so that we quote own more of this",
    "doesn't mean we own the lab but we own",
    "some of the capacity in the lab labs",
    "here in the state of ohio",
    "and the pooling also uh is something",
    "that's uh",
    "that could be a very big game changer so",
    "this is evolving",
    "every single day and we're pushing and",
    "pushing",
    "because we know we're at about 22 000",
    "tests a day now we're averaging that's",
    "not enough",
    "i mean it's double what it was and",
    "triple what it was but it's it's not",
    "enough we got to keep moving",
    "so we'll keep everybody and try to keep",
    "everybody informed what we're doing",
    "our next question is from andy chow at",
    "ohio public radio and television",
    "hi governor a question for you and also",
    "uh for",
    "dr mohler when we're talking about",
    "tests coming back inaccurate is it more",
    "likely for a test to be",
    "false positive or false negative um",
    "and is one more concerning to you than",
    "the other",
    "i'll just say the the false positive was",
    "pretty concerning to me but uh let me",
    "let me talk to",
    "get uh dr mueller on there doctor you",
    "want to take that one",
    "sure so so i think um our goal is",
    "is to to ensure um a few few a few of",
    "either depending on the type of test and",
    "i won't get into too much of the science",
    "some have false positives and some have",
    "false negatives",
    "typically with the antigen test that is",
    "it is typically a false",
    "negative meaning that that you test",
    "negative",
    "and then you have to go back and be",
    "tested again and so i think we",
    "were obviously concerned with with with",
    "with either",
    "and because it it impacts you know",
    "whether it's the inconvenience of having",
    "to",
    "inappropriately you know quarantine for",
    "two weeks",
    "or getting the wrong health information",
    "so i think it's",
    "both are important to us and as the",
    "governor mentioned before",
    "those are the sorts of things that we",
    "think about before we would deploy",
    "massively uh a process i will go back to",
    "the",
    "telescope and binoculars view because it",
    "was brought up one's a good test and",
    "one's a bad test",
    "both are part of a toolbox right and we",
    "may need one",
    "that we can improve to serve a certain",
    "population and the other for another so",
    "it's",
    "it's just really important that we keep",
    "our minds open and continue to innovate",
    "thanks doctor our next question",
    "is from spencer hickey at hannah news",
    "service",
    "thank you and glad to hear your you've",
    "tested",
    "negative governor could you talk about",
    "the president's monday declaration that",
    "national guard duty would be extended",
    "through the end of the year but with",
    "most states picking up 25 percent share",
    "well we're glad to have the extension",
    "obviously we would have wanted the",
    "government",
    "federal government to pay at all but",
    "look the guard has played an integral",
    "role i talked to general harris",
    "every morning about where they're going",
    "what they're doing they played a an",
    "important role in our nursing homes uh",
    "they're",
    "certainly playing an important role out",
    "in our communities so",
    "we're grateful for the extension uh when",
    "we can get the federal government to",
    "pick up three-fourths of the cost uh",
    "that certainly is better than us",
    "taking the full cost uh frankly we'd",
    "already made a decision",
    "uh the federal government was not going",
    "to do that we certainly would have",
    "extended",
    "at least for a while of the guard's",
    "mission because it's so",
    "it's so crucial they have the ability to",
    "go out when we see a hot spot and a",
    "community wants us to come in",
    "they have the ability to go there and i",
    "would just say to any mayors",
    "anybody and county commissioners if",
    "you're looking",
    "any director of health if you think you",
    "do not have enough testing in your",
    "community",
    "and you've got some challenges you know",
    "talk to us talk to the national guard",
    "uh we're happy to come in and do do a",
    "test do testing",
    "uh for for a day so happy to do that",
    "governor our next question is from james",
    "pilcher at",
    "wkrc in cincinnati",
    "good afternoon governor i want to switch",
    "topics for just a second and talk about",
    "evictions",
    "uh evictions are on the rise and now",
    "that the 600 benefit is gone",
    "a lot of people are facing even more",
    "evictions possibly at the end of this",
    "month",
    "some experts say that it's actually",
    "cheaper to keep people in their homes",
    "than a victim",
    "where they'd be more uh apt to rely on",
    "social services",
    "at this point what are you prepared to",
    "do to keep the eviction rate down",
    "and are you prepared to discuss an",
    "eviction moratorium in the state of ohio",
    "well again we're hoping um to see some",
    "action additional action in congress",
    "that would be of some",
    "assistance uh to those individuals we've",
    "all seen the stories you've",
    "reported some of the stories uh of",
    "individuals who",
    "you know cannot make their payment uh",
    "their monthly rental",
    "payment uh so we're looking at it i",
    "don't have anything to announce today",
    "or really to add to it today but it",
    "certainly is a",
    "is a concern to us as we move forward",
    "but we're taking a look at",
    "our next question is from kevin landers",
    "at wbns in columbus",
    "hello governor hi kevin glad to see you",
    "my question is both for the governor and",
    "for the doctor uh did your pcr",
    "results show that you never had covid",
    "and it's i understand that pcr tests",
    "don't provide",
    "either false positives or false",
    "negatives and have you considered using",
    "the rainy day fund to help with",
    "evictions",
    "uh don't know about the last yet we're",
    "still looking looking at it",
    "uh i will refer it to dr mohler",
    "rest the question sure um",
    "so i can't help with the evictions but i",
    "can help with uh the pcr test so the",
    "the testing for pcr is is a snapshot in",
    "time",
    "and so what the test looked at last",
    "night is",
    "the swab that was taken from an",
    "individual",
    "is there rna for the virus on that swab",
    "it doesn't say has he had it three weeks",
    "ago it doesn't say what what an",
    "individual might have two weeks from now",
    "it is a snapshot in time test and is",
    "something that",
    "that again that's a limitation to a test",
    "that we think about of as we plan our",
    "strategy but it is again",
    "a snapshot in time doctor while it's a",
    "snapshot in",
    "time could you elaborate on that a",
    "little bit",
    "because if someone comes down with it uh",
    "on one day",
    "uh and then let's say 10 days later",
    "and is there is there a range in in in",
    "there that we would expect to find",
    "um to get a positive is there any kind",
    "of guidelines for that",
    "sure so so we know that we can detect um",
    "protect the virus with a pcr test",
    "between about one to",
    "about 15 or 20 days one of the things",
    "that we're working on now in the lab is",
    "how active is that virus as you get to",
    "some of those later stages",
    "and so as our tests become more and more",
    "accurate and i will say that for the",
    "for the researchers in the world out",
    "there that no test is a hundred percent",
    "no test is ever going to be 100 but but",
    "pretty darn close",
    "um we're looking to see you know how",
    "early can we can we detect it and then",
    "how far does it go out",
    "and what what we're trying to figure out",
    "governor is maybe",
    "once you get past day 14 or 15",
    "that you can detect virus by pcr but but",
    "maybe it's not as active or maybe you",
    "can't spread it as well so it's there",
    "but it may be dead so those are the",
    "sorts of questions that we're trying to",
    "figure out right now in the lab",
    "okay thank you thank you very much",
    "our next question is from justin dennis",
    "at mahoningmatters.com",
    "good afternoon governor we're glad to",
    "hear you're in good health after",
    "your test results yesterday were",
    "negative along those lines uh we'd like",
    "to know when",
    "the public might have access to such",
    "rapid pcr testing",
    "with results returned within hours",
    "currently they seem reserved for public",
    "officials and well-paid professional",
    "athletes",
    "and i've recently spoken with ohioans",
    "across the state who say people are",
    "still waiting more than a week for",
    "results",
    "um my colleague here at mahoney matters",
    "just this week waited four days",
    "what can you say to those people yeah",
    "what we can say",
    "is we're doing everything we can to",
    "increase the",
    "time look there's we have two challenges",
    "i'd say we collectively",
    "uh as a state uh one is we're not doing",
    "enough tests",
    "and we've got to continue to expand that",
    "out",
    "the second while some tests are coming",
    "back within a day",
    "two days which i think is is reasonable",
    "other tests are taking a lot longer to",
    "come back",
    "some of the tests that are historically",
    "the last few months have been taking the",
    "longest have been",
    "where we have national companies and",
    "they just get backed up",
    "and so somebody enters into a contract",
    "with the national company",
    "they're supposed to get it back in in",
    "two days and they end up getting back in",
    "five days or",
    "back in six days so",
    "it is not a uniform testing",
    "in the state of ohio there's a lot of",
    "different players a lot of different",
    "hospitals and so let me ask dr muller if",
    "he can just",
    "shed some light on what you might be",
    "seeing at ohio state",
    "but also anecdotally maybe what you're",
    "you're hearing from other",
    "uh testing places uh in ohio",
    "again you've got you have some hospitals",
    "are doing testing you've got places like",
    "uc you've got the cleveland clinic",
    "you've got",
    "you you've got uh you've got",
    "dayton children's we've got a lot of",
    "hospitals that are doing testing",
    "uh but we also have some some private uh",
    "national labs they're doing as well",
    "doctor yeah so",
    "i i would say that um you know we have",
    "great partnerships here at ohio state",
    "and patel to work with",
    "all the other labs across the across the",
    "state and in fact",
    "we do a lot of work where we communicate",
    "to",
    "maybe trade some of the tests so we can",
    "ensure rapid turnaround time",
    "one point that we talked about say 20",
    "minutes ago was this idea of pool",
    "testing",
    "pool testing is going to be absolutely",
    "key",
    "to being able to increase our turnaround",
    "time or in fact decrease our turnaround",
    "time and so",
    "that would be something that that would",
    "be fun to continue to talk about",
    "but but some of the modeling that we",
    "look at that where you're able to",
    "combine",
    "one in five or even one in ten samples",
    "is going to be able to decrease",
    "not only turnaround time but but really",
    "the cost",
    "as well as some of these issues with",
    "with uh",
    "with reagent supply",
    "and again uh doctor one of the things",
    "we've seen",
    "you just referenced is reagents",
    "some of frankly some of the labs in the",
    "state of ohio are being kind of",
    "strangled if i could use that term",
    "uh because the people who are they have",
    "uh",
    "uh their machines and they're sending in",
    "the reagent and they",
    "need to be sending the reagent to",
    "florida or texas or somewhere else",
    "and so they're rationing so our labs",
    "many of our labs are being",
    "literally rationed that's why we're",
    "constantly looking",
    "for other opportunities i just got a",
    "call about another",
    "possible opportunity right before i came",
    "on",
    "on the air here so if you want to add",
    "anything to that doctor",
    "or not no i i'd say the only thing that",
    "we continue to work with",
    "the cdc and the fda across the state",
    "labs to figure out if there's ways that",
    "we can continue",
    "to to expand our equipment and and",
    "reagent pool",
    "and in fact we have a project now that",
    "we're working on the fda with is to",
    "to be able to allow us to use some of",
    "the not so fancy telescopes",
    "that might be in college or university",
    "labs that they're using for teaching or",
    "using for",
    "some very basic research and redeploy",
    "those to be able to test and those",
    "those conversations are very active and",
    "will",
    "again help our our supply chain and",
    "turnaround times",
    "and those conversations doctor i find",
    "very exciting",
    "um we'll have to see how this this pans",
    "out but this has",
    "great possibilities not just for ohio",
    "state but for",
    "many many other universities and some",
    "even",
    "not so not so big in the state of ohio",
    "who have laboratories and that you know",
    "we might be able to",
    "deploy them in this in this battle in",
    "this war so",
    "it's very very exciting again that was",
    "one of the things that we were",
    "discussing",
    "when dr burks was out a couple weeks ago",
    "we discussed that with her and i know",
    "that",
    "ohio state has been been looking at that",
    "for some time",
    "your next question is from dave sess at",
    "wkbn in youngstown hey governor how has",
    "this experience influenced how you",
    "consider health orders whether it be",
    "towards schools",
    "churches bars or even ohioans",
    "well i think from a personal",
    "point of view um you know being informed",
    "yesterday about 11 o'clock that i had",
    "the coven it does center your attention",
    "and it focuses your attention",
    "and you know i've studied this enough",
    "i'm not expert i'm not doctor i'm not a",
    "scientist",
    "but you sort of know what your odds are",
    "um and even for 73 year old the odds are",
    "pretty good",
    "but the wrist level obviously has gone",
    "goes up because of age because of the",
    "fact that",
    "you know i have asthma so yeah it",
    "focuses your attention",
    "uh and it you know my attention has been",
    "focused on this but i think when it",
    "becomes personal",
    "um you know you you think about it and",
    "you think of",
    "i think you understand better i",
    "understood better",
    "how other people feel when they're told",
    "they have covet uh and when they're told",
    "you know hey this is what you got to do",
    "uh this is what may happen",
    "um yeah it's uh yeah i think it",
    "it it brings home the gravity of it",
    "in a very very very personal way",
    "next question is from adrian robbins at",
    "wcmh in columbus",
    "hi governor thank you again for being",
    "here and i'm glad to hear that you're",
    "doing well",
    "um the white house continues to worry",
    "about these new kind of outbreaks we're",
    "seeing in rural areas",
    "earlier this week they even brought up",
    "ohio as an example of these outbreaks",
    "you also sound like you're concerned",
    "about this what are your experts saying",
    "about this kind of spread in rural ohio",
    "and what can be done to combat it",
    "yeah i mean what the experts are saying",
    "dr burks who was in here as i said a",
    "couple weeks ago",
    "uh and what we're seeing in some other",
    "states is this spread",
    "in into rural areas is not unique to",
    "ohio first of all",
    "the fall excuse me the spring march",
    "onward or many rural areas",
    "felt like they were untouched they may",
    "have had some cases but",
    "no but you know you didn't know very",
    "much if you lived there you probably",
    "didn't know anybody that had",
    "had it or certainly no one had died from",
    "it",
    "that's not going to be what is happening",
    "it's not what's happening now in ohio",
    "uh you know we're into a very different",
    "spread",
    "it's a deeper spread it's a more",
    "comprehensive",
    "spread it is out into our rural areas in",
    "the rural areas who are yellow",
    "counties that were yellow on that map",
    "you know they got to fight hard to stay",
    "yellow because",
    "it's we've seen so many of the yellow",
    "counties over the last few weeks turn",
    "orange so it's a real battle but it",
    "comes back to basics",
    "uh it comes back to distance",
    "mask sanitation be careful",
    "i mean it just comes back back to basics",
    "and the people in the counties that were",
    "worried about those top ten counties uh",
    "you know",
    "they have it within their own control i",
    "mean we've told their local health",
    "department whatever you need we're going",
    "to give to you",
    "what do you need from us but the most",
    "important thing that can happen",
    "is for people in those counties to put",
    "masks on when they go out in public",
    "to keep a distance to understand when",
    "they're celebrating a happy event or",
    "or in sorrow in a funeral that",
    "their lives are still at risk and you",
    "know even though they're among friends",
    "even though they're among family that",
    "because so many people",
    "have no symptoms but are carrying the",
    "virus",
    "you know they got to be careful no",
    "matter who they're around",
    "and so that's what will stop it in the",
    "rural areas",
    "the people in the rural areas can",
    "control it i'll say this you know the",
    "most",
    "in rural areas most schools are planning",
    "on going back in person",
    "how long those schools are able to go",
    "back in person",
    "will be determined by not only what",
    "school officials do and i am",
    "every confidence that they're going to",
    "do a great job but it's also what the",
    "people in the community do and how much",
    "community spread there is because when",
    "there is community spread you cannot",
    "keep it out of your school",
    "because kids are going in there and",
    "they're mixing with other kids and it",
    "just",
    "it's a accelerator uh and you see",
    "you you're going to see the spread more",
    "so if we want our schools",
    "to stay open we want to be able to go in",
    "person which is what we",
    "want to see for our kids um",
    "the community has got to look at wearing",
    "a mask as",
    "a direct impact on how long that school",
    "stays open",
    "and how long the football team is able",
    "to play and how long the band is able to",
    "play",
    "and how how long all the other things",
    "that we want to do connected with our",
    "schools is able",
    "to take place it is a direct connection",
    "it is a direct connection and so i just",
    "would appeal to all my friends",
    "uh you know wherever you live in ohio",
    "what you do is going to determine you",
    "know how long the kids are in school",
    "next question is from max philby at the",
    "columbus dispatch",
    "hi governor glad to see you're doing",
    "well today um",
    "but given yesterday's covid scare what",
    "kind of",
    "protocols are in place if you were to",
    "become seriously ill with the virus",
    "how would some of these decisions around",
    "you know health orders and other things",
    "get made",
    "i would make the decisions as long as i",
    "could uh if i got to the point where i",
    "could not make the decisions and i",
    "uh i will know i'll guarantee you",
    "then lieutenant governor uh",
    "john houston is in charge whether i'm",
    "making the decisions or john is making",
    "the decisions we have a",
    "a stellar team around us",
    "it's a team that's been with me many",
    "many years at the top",
    "top level these are people i implicitly",
    "trust",
    "some of them were with me in the united",
    "states senate been with me",
    "ag's office with me now",
    "so we have a very very good team we have",
    "people outside the administration that",
    "we consult all the time",
    "so you know this is not a case where",
    "the lieutenant governor you know is",
    "sitting over here and uh",
    "he does a little something that's not",
    "the case at all this lieutenant governor",
    "is involved in virtually every decision",
    "we make",
    "uh very very much so uh adds a great",
    "deal",
    "i'm very lucky to have him so i think",
    "people the state couldn't feel confident",
    "that something happens to me the state",
    "will move forward",
    "our next question is from john london at",
    "wlwt",
    "in cincinnati",
    "governor i know you just talked about",
    "schools just a second ago but",
    "reopening them remains very high",
    "interest and very controversial",
    "maybe more so since the mass mandate for",
    "all students",
    "i'm wondering what a successful school",
    "year looks like",
    "for you and is there a threshold where",
    "you'd order schools",
    "closed again and if so would that be",
    "district by district or",
    "or a statewide blanket well john i think",
    "it depends on the facts this is all",
    "going to be fact driven",
    "uh yes you're right it's been it was",
    "controversial i've talked to a lot of",
    "people",
    "about the mandatory mask order again",
    "there are exceptions",
    "and if someone can't wear them that's",
    "fine",
    "and they should not you know be",
    "criticized in any way that's fine",
    "but every health professional i have",
    "talked to",
    "every doctor who i've talked to said the",
    "wearing of masks in school",
    "not only can take place at a young age",
    "but should take place",
    "at a young age i trust the teachers the",
    "teachers will figure this out",
    "if there's some reason a child can't",
    "work that's going to be okay",
    "if the teacher is having if a child is",
    "having problems",
    "that's okay teachers will work it out i",
    "trust our teachers to do that",
    "but i said at the time uh our",
    "chance of getting through school getting",
    "school open",
    "kids physically there and keeping that",
    "going for for an",
    "extended period of time um is going to",
    "be in a direct relationship to two",
    "things",
    "one what's going on inside that school",
    "and are the students wearing masks and",
    "are they social distancing and is",
    "everybody doing what they",
    "need to do the picture we saw coming out",
    "of georgia for example is",
    "not what we want to see and i i trust",
    "that you will not see a picture like",
    "that coming out of ohio",
    "where everybody was crowded together in",
    "a hallway and no one would seem to be",
    "wearing a mask",
    "so that's one two is what happens to the",
    "community",
    "the community is going to control the",
    "future a lot because you cannot separate",
    "the community from the school",
    "and the spread that goes on the",
    "community will be in that school",
    "and you can pretty much mathematically",
    "figure out what it what it is",
    "in fact there's a you can go up on a web",
    "page and look at some projections",
    "uh so what we do in the community what",
    "we do in school",
    "uh and look uh the first people who are",
    "gonna know there's a problem in a school",
    "are the people in that school",
    "uh and i you know just as schools get",
    "close during the school year",
    "if there's flu you know if there's",
    "covid and flu covered",
    "you're going to see school systems make",
    "those decisions",
    "they're going to make them on the spot",
    "they're going to make them in the best",
    "interest",
    "of the people the community and i i",
    "trust them to do that",
    "could there come a time when it is so",
    "bad",
    "uh that and so dangerous that yeah we",
    "think we have to close",
    "you know schools in one area of the",
    "state or schools in",
    "in uh the whole state well i suppose",
    "that's a possibility but let's let's",
    "don't",
    "we're not going to get there until we",
    "get we see what the facts are",
    "um you know this virus has a mind of its",
    "own we have no idea",
    "how it's going to progress there seems",
    "to be a consensus at least in the",
    "national experts that i've talked to",
    "that would indicate that",
    "november december january could be tough",
    "could be tough i mean our first hurdle",
    "is going to be going back to school",
    "we are now down to about 5.5 percent",
    "statewide positivity",
    "higher than we would like lower than it",
    "was",
    "three weeks ago when it's 6.5 so we're",
    "not going in",
    "at a real high level but we're certainly",
    "not going into the low level we wish we",
    "were starting going back to school at a",
    "lower level",
    "but we're not it is what it is today uh",
    "but again i would plead with everyone",
    "out there we've got a couple weeks from",
    "most",
    "most areas of the state before school",
    "starts do everything you can",
    "drive these numbers down slow this thing",
    "down because when school starts",
    "we're going to see naturally we would",
    "expect to see",
    "an uptick now if everyone wears masks uh",
    "for everyone's social distances",
    "uh and if in times when school's out",
    "people are",
    "are focused on it yeah we can we can",
    "slow this down immensely",
    "so done we're just going to take it day",
    "at a time",
    "we're going to keep in touch with what's",
    "going on in our schools and uh",
    "but the first line of defense is going",
    "to be out there with those",
    "superintendents as",
    "school boards those principals and and",
    "those teachers",
    "next question is from molly coweek at",
    "whio in dayton",
    "hi governor you had two different types",
    "of tests an antigen",
    "and a pcr but you of course got",
    "different results says the",
    "state track its testing data by",
    "separating it by the type of test",
    "and how can ohioans feel competent with",
    "the data that's being released daily",
    "they can feel confident and dab that's",
    "released daily because that",
    "is uh fundamentally the pcr",
    "data as we said we think about 1.3",
    "million ohioans",
    "uh 1.3 million tests have been done",
    "and those are the pcr tests the vast",
    "majority of those",
    "are there is a breakout on",
    "our web page we looked at that frankly",
    "a little more carefully",
    "i looked at maybe a little more",
    "carefully it looks like",
    "the second section which is the non-pcr",
    "probably needs to be broken out better",
    "so we're",
    "working on that but the key factor is",
    "if you're watching this and you've had a",
    "test in ohio the odds are very very",
    "heavy it was pcr test which is state of",
    "the art",
    "and that's what you had",
    "thank you our next question",
    "is from jake zuckerman at the ohio",
    "capitol",
    "journal",
    "we will come back to jake our next",
    "question is from jesse ballmer",
    "at the uh cincinnati inquirer",
    "hi thanks my question i guess is about",
    "the ohio department of health data that",
    "is some of which is in a system that's",
    "19 years old i guess what's the first",
    "step",
    "into improving that system and how",
    "difficult will that be with the state's",
    "current financial",
    "situation amid coronavirus well look",
    "we're going to do what we have to do",
    "the problem is we're also in the middle",
    "of a pandemic",
    "and it's all hands on deck now to deal",
    "with the pandemic",
    "so we know",
    "that to fix this system it's probably to",
    "permanently fix it to get a new system",
    "start with that",
    "to get a new system it's going to take",
    "longer than this pandemic we hope lasts",
    "uh so but that's that's what we're gonna",
    "that's what we're gonna strive for we're",
    "gonna do it right",
    "look we're going to have other things",
    "that we need to track we hope we don't",
    "have",
    "anything like this for another 100 years",
    "but",
    "we don't know that we have to we have to",
    "be prepared so yeah we'll invest what we",
    "need to invest",
    "because this is essential it's an area",
    "that frankly has been under invested in",
    "do we have uh jake zuckerman from ohio",
    "capitol journal",
    "am i coming through here okay",
    "governor sorry about that uh ohio tested",
    "about 22",
    "000 people per day in july and the ohio",
    "department of health told the federal",
    "government it plans to pcr test just",
    "about 24 000 people per day in august",
    "so the growth is pretty modest there",
    "we're about seven months into this",
    "pandemic",
    "why is ohio still failing to scale up",
    "its testing and",
    "what are the choke yeah we are",
    "we're not failing to scale up our",
    "testing we've scaled it up",
    "that's one second when i saw",
    "what our department they told me what",
    "they're reporting i said",
    "that's not acceptable i said you can",
    "send that in",
    "but that's not what our goal is so that",
    "is not acceptable those numbers are",
    "simply not acceptable now let's look at",
    "the big the big picture",
    "new virus health departments",
    "not had invested in health departments",
    "not invested in",
    "in the testing so this thing started",
    "basically from",
    "from zero when this pandemic",
    "hit we have",
    "fortunately never been a state that's",
    "been tops",
    "or even in the top third i don't think",
    "uh we controlled it",
    "going in uh we're controlling it coming",
    "out not as well as we like",
    "but we are controlling it and we're not",
    "a hot spot",
    "we never were new york god love them",
    "we never were florida we never were",
    "texas",
    "but what that has meant is that we've",
    "never been a priority",
    "um very understandably when the federal",
    "government makes decisions about",
    "allocation and they they indicate two",
    "different",
    "different companies we're never a",
    "priority uh now we've got good",
    "cooperation from the federal government",
    "good",
    "cooperation with trump uh administration",
    "but we're never a priority and that's",
    "good in the sense that we never were",
    "that bad uh",
    "so that's one of the one of the things",
    "we've not ever been",
    "on fire here in ohio and we don't want",
    "to be on fire",
    "second you know we have worked",
    "to increase the capacity uh we have",
    "we there's no testing system in ohio",
    "we have a whole bunch of labs and what",
    "we have tried to do",
    "is do a couple things one is we've gone",
    "out on the market",
    "and bought lab capacity from vent from",
    "companies",
    "uh and at the same time we've we have",
    "been building up our own system we've",
    "got a couple things that we're very",
    "excited about we're building up what we",
    "call our central lab which is not just",
    "in one place but it's",
    "in other labs we have a working",
    "relationship for example with dayton",
    "children's hospital",
    "and they have taken part of their",
    "facilities in middletown and turned it",
    "in",
    "turning it now into a lab so uh that",
    "figure that you",
    "you quoted early on uh you know my goal",
    "is to",
    "certainly exceed that and keep moving so",
    "uh eric has given me the sign we are",
    "ready to get off so i want to thank",
    "everybody",
    "very very much and we look forward to",
    "seeing you back",
    "on tuesday uh fray and i will get these",
    "tests tomorrow we'll report those tests",
    "out",
    "in a news release as soon as we have",
    "results from tomorrow",
    "have a good weekend everybody thank you",
