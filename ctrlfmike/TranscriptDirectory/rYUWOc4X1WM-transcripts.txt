so
[Music]
good afternoon everyone today i'm
wearing a tie
from university hospitals in cleveland
we are blessed in ohio to have some
amazing hospitals and so
i wear this to honor all the first-line
workers
doctors nurses everyone who makes all
our hospitals
work every single day for us around the
state of ohio
today i think we should uh pause
and talk a little bit about where we are
uh in this coronavirus and where we're
going
um in a sense you can liken this to
halftime uh mill the game no one knows
exactly if we're
in the middle but uh probably not not
too far away
uh from that i'll talk about that
in in a moment but let's first go to our
uh slides and look and look at the data
for today
today we are reporting 1447
new cases uh to put this in perspective
in the last seven days our cases have
averaged
uh close to that a little bit over that
1475 cases per day
by report date we had been averaging
to put this in perspective a little over
a thousand cases per day
only two weeks ago so we've gone up
quite dramatically in several weeks
let's look at the positivity another way
of looking at this
as we increase
the testing uh we would hope to be
seeing
a drop in positivity we're not seeing
that
this is a chart that only goes back and
i want to make sure everyone understands
this goes back to july 1.
from july 1 basically to the present
you can see what's happened our
positivity is now showing for the last
day 4.1
uh 3.9 for the last seven day
average uh it was 2.7
on september 23rd and 24th
so again these numbers have gone up
dramatically
let's take a look at our top 88
88 counties and what you will see here
again these numbers just continue uh
these numbers
unfortunately just continue to to go up
um athens
and fayette county uh are both
in putnam mercer dark
all those counties are about three times
what the high incidence level
of the cdc so it's off the charts
and then we go on down from there so
again starting athens fayette
putnam mercer dark all glaze jackson
butler henry miami fulton allen ross
shelby then the green clark montgomery
sayo to lawrence
muskingham those are the top top
counties
as we move as we move forward
this map now shows how many counties are
red
and how many are high incense um
so red county as you can see
if it's a high incidence level um
that simply means that they're over 100
cases per
100 000 for every every two weeks
so we're now seeing 51 of our counties
that are high incidence counties and
that's just a real
real problem what this means is we've
seen this spread
and if you look at this if you're in a
high incident county or you're a red
county
you know we certainly should be
concerned
uh we're not trying to scare anybody but
but these measures have never looked
like this since we've done this we've
never had as many high incidence
counties
and we certainly have a lot of red
counties so if you look at for example
the western side of the state two
counties in
every single county uh looks like it's
high incidence
uh or or red county and this really
shows just how this virus has spread
uh out throughout throughout the state
um and again if
if your county's red or high incidence
that's a big
big concern um so let's
let's step back for a moment uh and kind
of look
where we are going as i say maybe it
sort of like being at halftime and i get
questions all the time mike when's this
going to be over
um governor work when i can take off my
mask i'm sick of the mask
when can i do that
what's our goal what's halloween going
to look like what's thanksgiving going
to look like what's
christmas going to look like um
next year baseball uh and on and on
um and these are the things that we all
ask ourselves
now the truth is that no one can answer
these questions with great certainty
what we can say is that things will get
better
but in all likelihood they will get
worse before they get better
and we're already seeing that in the
trend lines of the last
several weeks virus is
tough it's cunning it will not give up
sort of has a mind of its own uh and all
the experts that we talked to
for months now have said you know
when the cold weather hits more people
move inside we can't really be outside
as much
that's when we're going to see more more
spread
but i think it's important for us to
look at before we look at the future
and again no one can predict the future
but we just
i'll base this on what the experts tell
me and
people i talk to i spent all day
yesterday on the phone talking to
more people many of them around around
the country who have been following this
very
very very closely i think it's important
though to talk
first about what we've achieved because
we've achieved a lot you have achieved a
lot
ohioans have done exceedingly well
during this if you compare us
with other countries uh if you compare
us with some other states
you know we're doing we're doing pretty
well and what we've really avoided
because of what ohioans have done and
what they've not done
what we've really avoided is these this
huge spike
uh where we would see our hospitals uh
overflowing
uh we all remember first seeing those
stories coming out of italy
we've seen them come out of new york
we've seen them come out of california
in texas
uh florida um more recently
mississippi uh now we've seen you know
high incidents up in
south dakota north dakota so
despite the great tragedy
500 or excuse me 5 000 deaths
many families who are a parent both
parents are
out of work we've seen small businesses
close we've seen
small businesses struggle we've seen an
increase
in in people with mental health problems
so this
virus is certainly not been benign and
we have not been spared
and the people of ohio have not been
spared but
because of what you have done we've
gotten to where we are today
and we're in better shape uh than we
would have been
uh if you hadn't made the sacrifices
so many of you have worn masks no one
wants to wear a mask we
all get tired of it so many of you kept
distance so many of you have done
the really the basic things that we know
that we have to do
uh so i'm proud of of where we are not
proud of me but i'm proud of
what you have done um you've really made
a big
big big difference we've avoided these
large
outbreaks that other countries and other
states have seen
we've certainly seen more deaths then we
want more cases than we want
but we're doing well compared
to many states and countries
let's talk now about the future
what is the future again no one can
predict it
but let me just talk about what uh the
experts are telling me
and best that i can discern this
um
we talked we've talked in the past about
it could be a tough winter
could be a tough november december
january
uh because we're moving inside uh
because we're also now seeing
for the last two weeks some fairly
significant
spread and spread through the greater
part of ohio at a high
at a high rate
cases up positivity up hospital
admissions
are up plus the
early first indicators doctor visits
emergency room visits people with
covet-like symptoms these are
going up very very fast
but i think the thing that we should
remember we can control a lot of this
can't control it all virus is not going
to go away
until we get the vaccine until we get
the herd immunity
but we can control and mitigate a lot
of this we've done it before and we can
do it again
ohioans are tough we're resilient we're
workers
we focus um
when the goals are clear when the goals
are clear
when we set our sights on those goals
when we set our sights on victory we can
in fact do it and have done it
to paraphrase something a science
reporter wrote yesterday
that i read how we come out of this
the final death toll from proven 19
for example how it impacts
all of us with jobs and business
will really depend on
both what we do all of us do
right here in ohio and it will also
depend
on how quickly we get the vaccine and
frankly how well
it works most of us
in ohio are not scientists most of us
are not involved in this effort although
some ohioans are
[Music]
so we can't most of us control that but
what we can control is what
we do let's talk about
what we do know about the vaccine
look we have every indication that
president trump's
operation warp speed uh which is being
subsidized uh
to with a lot of money
uh where they're subsidizing vaccine
companies
clinical trials and manufacturing costs
um we have every indication is working
as new york times reported yesterday the
operation is and i quote
working with a remarkable efficiency
doesn't mean there won't be glitches
doesn't mean
it'll be perfect but it seems to be
coming along
and so it is coming and judging by all
the indicators uh it will work
um as i said we aren't the scientists we
can't control the development of this
vaccine that's beyond our ability
the money's been put in the right people
are working on it
and they're working on it exceedingly
hard
here's what we can control it does come
back to the basics
we can control what we do every day we
can control keeping a distance from
other people
we can we can control whether or not we
assume that other people who we are
seeing
might have that virus and that we back
off
keep the distance we can control as i
said we're in the mass we can control
whether we keep the distance we can
control whether we wash our hands
whether we take all the normal
precautions and what we do collectively
is going to determine frankly what the
next
few months are going to be
if we could get mass compliance up 85 90
percent in this state
every county we would fundamentally
change what the next
few months will be like
so as we look forward uh you know
no one knows exactly how long this is
going to take with the vaccine
so we don't know how much longer we're
gonna have to do this
um but several people i've talked to and
things i could read uh you know indicate
that
you know by summer
this coming summer you know we could be
in a position where
we're getting it out the vaccine out in
in
a large large section of uh
our state of ohio
what should be our goals as we move
forward
we got to keep our economy moving
keeping the jobs we have creating as
many new jobs as we can
keeping our small businesses going
to do that to do that and to keep our
desks down
and we will have to keep this virus from
flaring up
we all want to get through this alive
and unhurt
so we can be there for our children and
grandchildren
to celebrate birthdays baptisms weddings
everybody has different goals for some
it's keeping your kids in school
making it possible for them to play
sports
making it possible for them to be in
theater making it possible for them to
be in debate
choir whatever their their passion is
what we do in our communities will
determine that
because the schools live in that
environment
and if we allow that virus to flare up
in our community it is going to go in
to our schools it's the same way with
our nursing homes
when nursing homes are hit they're hit
because someone is bringing that in
not not obviously on purpose but they're
coming in
and so that what's going on in the
community reflects what goes on in the
nursing home
and so again worry mass keeping a
distance in the community will
impact our schools our ability to keep
kids in school it will impact our
ability to keep our
nursing homes free of the drug um
free of the virus excuse me
everybody's got different goals maybe
your uh goal is to be back in the
horseshoe
um with 100 000 so of your fellow champ
fans cheering on uh the ohio state
buckeyes maybe your goal is to be
able to go to a busy farmers market on a
beautiful
saturday morning with your family to see
your neighbors pick up some
fresh produce and i will say that that's
certainly something that
you can do now and is going on if you're
careful
maybe your goal is to be able to hug
your best friend uh who has some medical
problem uh whatever your version of the
why is
uh that's what is is at stake
and what we collectively do will
determine our ability to do this um
our game plan in every sport we have a
there's a game plan
we have a game plan uh our game plan is
to wear a mask when you're out
or mask when you're in a place where
you'll see others
stick with our game plan execute the
plays this is exactly how we will
disrupt the viruses game plan
the virus wants us to get complacent it
needs us
to spread it and only spreads with with
our help
some friends of ours uh friends of all
ohioans
uh did a public service ad that i think
captures the greatness of ohio
uh the strength of our people and what
we have to do in this
second half to win
there are moments in life when all the
greats are tested but they persevere
adapt and never ever give up
ohio that's you you've saved countless
lives and slowed the spread
but we can't let up we need to stick to
our game plan
because we know it works that way we can
return to doing all the things
we love and enjoy with our families and
our friends
ohio when we stick together we always
win
it's up to all of us
well we're ohioans highlands play until
the end
ohioans never ever give up
and in the motivational words of our
coaches
when ohioans stick together we always
win
and it's up to all of us
ohio lost uh two of its um
greatest citizens yesterday
joe morgan john ruthen
since iran's hall of famer joe morgan
was the greatest second baseman of all
time
he was a great base runner hitter
and most importantly he was a gracious
and genuinely
nice person i had the occasion to meet
him i think twice and he was
amazingly gracious he's a person who
mastered
every detail of the game of baseball
fran and i saw him play many many times
with our
older children pat and jill becky and
john
it was a thrill to watch him during the
years of the big red machine
later as an announcer he had a unique
i think ability to explain what was
happening on the field
to the average fan our younger kids
brian alice
mark and anna probably knew him more
as mr sunday night baseball than they
did as a
even as a baseball player he was the
voice of sunday night baseball
he was truly a master at explaining the
why of baseball why something happened
he also used his talents in the business
world and for charitable causes
right here in the state of ohio and we
extend our condolences to his family
to his teammates and to his friends
yesterday ohio lost one of its most
gifted artists
with the death of john ruffin born in
cincinnati spent more than half his life
living on 165-acre farmhouse
built in 1836 in georgetown ohio
as a young man john ruffin served his
country in world war ii as a member of
the greatest
generation fran i knew john and his
late wife judy as a special thrill
to visit him in his studio and to see
the work that
he was doing he used his talents to
paint ohio's great varieties of
animals plants as well as world's
natural treasures his painting of our
state bird
the cardinal was used for licensed
plants
and earned five million dollars for the
ohio division of wildlife
in addition john and judy bought and
helped restore
president grant's boyhood home in
georgetown ohio
ensuring it would be preserved for
generations to come and getting it on
the national register
of historic places the rufflins donated
grant's boyhood home to the history
connection to the people of the state of
ohio
in 2002. history was so important
to them that john created a foundation
to preserve history to honor judy
after she died john rufflin
was often called ohio's 20th century
audubon
this is really a fitting tribute to his
talents and his lifelong dedication
to sharing the beauty of ohio's natural
treasures with all of us
another difficulty that has arisen
during the
coronavirus uh is the patients have not
been able to take their children to the
pediatrician for well-child visits as
often as recommended
this led to a decline in the number of
vaccinations
administered to protect against diseases
such as
chickenpox measles whooping cough
and polio we're starting to catch up on
these numbers
but there's still some reason to be
concerned there's a danger of these
diseases could easily spread if children
are not
vaccinated we've seen during this
pandemic just how important vaccines can
be
while we do not have a vaccine for cover
19 we can prevent more than a dozen
other diseases
from harming our children in our
communities and we can do that right
now i want to share this public service
announcement which you will see
more in the coming months it stresses
the importance of childhood vaccines in
the care of our children
this boo-boo tells a story
it's a tale of perseverance ingenuity
and love this boo-boo is hundreds of
years of science and technology
it's protection in the battle against
disease and illness
and while we continue to fight kovid 19
childhood vaccinations are more
important than ever
this boo-boo it's love in its purest
form
in addition in the coming days the ohio
department medicaid will launch a number
of initiatives to encourage childhood
immunizations among their members
these efforts will be aimed at
increasing safe convenient access to
vaccinations for members by providing
mobile vaccination clinics and reducing
administrative barriers
for providers it's critical that ohioans
and providers remain vigilant about
keeping children up to date on these
vaccines
we cannot let cova 19 prevent us from
meeting our essential
health care needs please contact your
pediatrician or your health department
today
to schedule these important well-child
visits
today i've asked dr
chris peltier a doctor from cincinnati
children's medical center
to join us to tell us more about the
importance of childhood
vaccines doctor is also a provider at
pediatric associates of mount carmel and
president-elect
the ohio chapter of the american academy
of pediatrics doctor thank you
very much for joining us thanks for
having me again governor
tell us a little bit about just in
general what's going on with childhood
vaccinations i know that some doctors
have expressed some concerns about
uh you know maybe not having enough
families come in yet
and maybe tell us a little bit about
what you're seeing
uh but also just tell us the basics tell
us why why is this very important
definitely i'd be glad to so as a result
of the pandemic as you mentioned vaccine
rates are definitely plummeting
not only here in ohio but across the
country we know that during the shutdown
last spring
well child visits to pediatricians fell
which ultimately
in addition to many other things like
not being able to do vision and hearing
screens
ultimately to the rates of vaccinations
many families were obviously worried
about going to
their pediatrician or their family
doctor was it safe
and we know i want to share with you
some data so from
january through april the cdc reported a
cumulative decrease
in 2.5 million doses of vaccines that
were administered
and just looking at the measles months
rubella vaccine
the cdc noted a national decrease in
over 350
000 visits there's a national group of
independent pediatricians
that it really involves about a thousand
pediatricians that share the same
electronic health record
and some data from that company showed
that
decreases in the diphtheria tetanus and
whooping cough vaccine
dropped almost 50 percent up through
april
and the hpv or human papillomavirus
vaccine rates dropped
by almost 75 percent
as you said it definitely is improving
and we
are seeing well visits return to higher
levels than they were during the spring
but in many practices that's still not
up to
100 percent or where it's been and not
only that but now we're having to try to
get in families that delayed their well
child business and their vaccinations
uh when when ohio was shut down
so why is it important i mean i think we
all know just
intuitively this is important but what
what are the consequences if if our
numbers are not where they need to be
and if we don't hit a certain level of
uh children with these vaccinations
right so
the ultimate outcome is that we run the
risk of an outbreak of vaccine
preventable illnesses
like whooping cough like measles and a
worsening flu epidemic than we normally
would have you may have seen
the american academy of pediatrics has a
an infographic that they've been
publishing on social media
trying to prevent what they call a
twindemic so you know you
very sadly demonstrated where we're at
in the fight against kovid we are at the
very beginning of influenza season
and you know we worry that if
we aren't vaccinating against things
like measles
whooping cough influenza we're gonna see
greater closures in schools we're gonna
have more impact
on the economic outcomes for parents and
caregivers
and i think most importantly there's
going to be a strain on the already
taxed health system due to covid
to care for these children there's an
interesting study that was published
recently in the
european journal lancet that that really
looked at trying to put in perspective
and what they the the data that they
found
showed that for parents that are worried
about bringing their children to
their pediatrician for risk of getting
coveted
for every one death
that could be attributed to covid that
could potentially
be caught by going to your health care
provider
in delaying vaccinations 84
deaths in children could be prevented
from other vaccine preventable illnesses
like whooping cough
measles and flu now of course we're not
you know one death is too many but it
just sort of puts it in
in perspective when we're saying you
know if a parent doesn't want to bring
their child to the pediatrician for fear
they may get exposed to covid
you know that one possible prevention of
a death
could result in 84 other preventable
deaths due to other
other illnesses failure to vaccinate
against these ki
failure to vaccinate against these
diseases leaves our ohio children
unnecessarily vulnerable and with covet
19 transmissions running high as you so
eloquently stated at the beginning of
this press conference
it's more important to vaccinate kids
against all preventable vaccine
illnesses but also influenza
the american academy of pediatric
recommends that everybody age six months
and up
should be vaccinated against influenza
ideally by halloween we have the
the ohio aap has a social media campaign
right now
no boo without flu so trying to get your
flu vaccine
um by halloween uh and and
whooping cough is not something that we
think exists anymore but
it does right we've had occasionally
there's an outbreak that you'll see
somewhere
in the country and sometimes maybe even
even ohio i think
so we see we see outbreaks every year
it's probably the
most common vaccine preventable illness
that we see every year
we have outbreaks in our local schools
and the significance of women cough is
what tell us about it
so you know it in older
children it can cause as soon as 100 day
cough so kids can have
sort of this nagging cough they may feel
sick the biggest thing is they're
contagious so they have to be isolated
during their contagious period
the real risk is in young infants and
babies
and that whooping cough can cause young
infants to stop breathing
and ultimately we see deaths every year
from whooping cough in young infants
wow and pretty much preventable right
exactly good doctor thank you for
joining us
you're right last question if anybody's
watching this and they have a child
uh who can they contact if they don't
have a doctor
what do they do well so it right
for i'm gonna just before i answer that
question i will say for those families
that do have a pediatrician
ask your pediatrician you know make sure
you're up to date when you
don't don't just say vaccines for well
visits if you're coming in for
an ill visit ask your pediatrician am i
am i up to date on my vaccines can i get
a flu shot today
um pediatricians offices are safe
they're open
we have flu vaccine and we have all of
the other vaccines
that that children need if you don't
have
a primary care provider i would
recommend families go to their local
health department
they can go to the health department and
get vaccines vaccines at both your
pediatricians
as well as your local health department
are completely free of charge
and ohio has a vaccine registry program
that my office participates in all of
the county health departments
participate in
and even if you don't have a copy of
your child's shot record
and you don't know which vaccines your
child may be due for
your pediatrician or the county health
department can go into that
impact vaccine registry and see what
vaccines your child is due for
doctor thanks for joining us again thank
you very much
today we're launching a new dashboard
that we hope will be
a valuable resource for private entities
who are administering cova 19
tests we know that pharmacists
nursing homes colleges universities
employers and others
are now administering tests and but they
may struggle to find a lab
to run their samples our new lab
capacity dashboard
provides self-reported information about
labs that can run tests
including hours of operation types of
tests that they accept
estimated turnaround time and locations
if it's accessible on covet
or coven 19 dashboard at
coronavirus.ohio.gov
under the other resources tab the other
resources tab
labs with available capacity can sign up
to be included in this dashboard by
linking to a form
on the web page this new resource will
help connect groups that are
testing with available labs in order to
ease turnaround times and inform ohio
and their kova 19
status
many of you may have heard about uh the
binax now testing um
these are 150 million
uh abbott binex now cuban 19 tests
that the federal government purchased
and are now distributing to
the states um as i said 150 million of
these are now being distributed we
received our first
shipment a few days ago these low-cost
tests provide a rapid response or an
important step towards ramping up
testing at the kind of scale we need in
order to limit
the spread of the virus my team and i
have been working to determine how to
incorporate these
antigen tests into our state testing
strategy and we've been consulting
doctors
and other health experts we have now
started as i said to receive these
tests beginning this week we are
deploying
some of these tests to our colleges and
to our universities to help them
implement the proactive screening plan
that we recommend
in addition we plan to aggressively
deploy these tests
to our nursing homes
as we know nursing homes must comply
with very significant
federal testing requirements and given
the vulnerability of residents
nursing homes have been our priority
for testing since the beginning of the
pandemic we're working with the nursing
home industry
to integrate these tests into our
existing testing plan in the most
strategic
and effective way and we'll be now
announcing uh more of the details
as we move forward uh next week we'll
begin sending
thousands of these tests to nursing
homes for both routine and outbreak
testing
requirements as we implement these
strategies
we will continue to evaluate our supply
of these tests
and where they can move the needle in
the fight against this virus
i also want to say two things as we
begin ramping up the use of these
particular tests first
we have discussed before that lab-based
pcr tests
are certainly the gold standard and
provide the most accurate
results anagen tests the binex tests
and others can have some level of
false positives and false negatives
this is a trade-off a trade-off with
having tests that allow us to do some
screening testing we do have protocols
to follow up on
test results they're most likely to be
false but we need to be aware that this
is part of testing
at this scale the opportunity test more
broadly
and more often makes this an important
step forward in our fight against coba
19 spread even with the lower
sensitivity
and specificity of these tests
finally i want to emphasize that no test
not energy test
not pcr are a substitute nothing is a
substitute for the precautions that we
talk about every single day or a mass
social distancing avoiding
large gatherings and when someone gets a
negative test
the great fear that doctors expressed to
us and scientists expressed to us
is that that person will instantly in
their head say hey
i'm home safe i'm free and stop wearing
a mask or stop social distancing that's
just the opposite of what
should happen getting a negative test is
not a green light to let your guard down
it's a look at your status
at one single point in time
testing is an important tool if we're
truly going to stay ahead of covet it
will be
through acting responsibly and taking
care of each other
there was another tragic week in our
state with the
least 16 more people killed in ohio as a
result of gun
violence an additional 22 people were
shot including a baby in a stroller
it happened in cleveland five-month-old
infant
18 year old hospitalized after being
shot on cleveland's
east side according to reports someone
in a car opened fire
hitting the teen who was outside his
home one of the browns also entered the
house where the baby
was in his stroller both victims
suffered gunshot wounds
to the stomach it's just absolutely
senseless
this infant has been on this earth just
a few months and already a victim
of gun violence according to columbus
dispatch which is doing a series of
reports focused on gun violence in
central ohio
48 children 48 children younger than 16
were treated at nationwide children's
hospital in columbus for gunshot wounds
from january through september of this
year 48
children the report points out that
minority children are twice as likely to
be shot
than caucasian children
this is just horrific this is
unacceptable
legislation pending with the general
assembly will help prevent some of these
needless
shootings here are a few more headlines
from the past seven days
seven days in trumbull county dispute
over money led to shooting
in fowler according to reports the
suspect shot the victim in the torso and
neck
the alleged gunman is now facing
multiple charges including having
weapons under disability
meaning he was prohibited by law from
having a gun
before that in columbus
friends born loss of 23 year old ohio
state student killed in shooting
this happened on sunday a marketing
major at ohio state
was shot to death outside of a former
fraternity house in the university
district
reports say the shooting stemmed from an
argument related to a party
according to court records the alleged
gunman was out on bond awaiting
sentencing after pleading guilty to a
felony burglary charge
because of this pending case the suspect
under current law could legally not
possess a gun yet he allegedly did so
anyway violating ohio's
weak law on criminals possessing guns a
law that we have to toughen
now a college student is dead we must
strengthen ohio's laws as they relate to
convicted felons
this is not hard what we're simply
saying is
let's model ohio's law
after the federal law and so someone is
convicted of a
violent offense in ohio they already
lose their right to have a gun
what our bill would simply say is that
that judge
after that person has been found guilty
if they're found guilty
being a criminal convicted of a violent
offense
first and then being in possession of a
gun
again the judge could impose a very
heavy
sentence we don't mandate the judge do
it but give the judges
the opportunity to do it our bill is
pretty simple
and it's something that we know will
pull
some of these violent offenders off our
streets
a study that we did when i was the
attorney general
done at ohio state university we went
back to the 1977 from then on until
today and what we found are until that
period of time
and what we found is the vast majority
of
violent crimes are committed by a very
small percentage
of our criminal element it's those
individuals that we simply have to
target
that's what our bill does this bill
was introduced by senator matt dolan
last october
and it will prevent would have prevented
some
at least of these violent crimes
that are occurring i think we're ready
for questions
governor first question today will be
from jim otty at w-h-i-o in dayton
hey jim governor good afternoon i want
to take you back to your original
statement this is about the
the terrible threshold that we've
reached now over 5000 deaths
going back to march when this all began
did you ever imagine
we would get to this point ever and
secondly
do you have any inkling as to what
percentage of the five thousand
perhaps those people those victims
had other medical problems other
complications
and some way to put this in perspective
so that people understand
who is actually suffering the most from
this
well jim first of all i don't think any
of us had an idea where this was going
we saw some projections
um you know some of the projections were
higher than this
uh i think it's a tribute to the people
the state of ohio that
we didn't it hasn't been more than this
uh if we wouldn't been wearing masks if
we people would not have been
careful initially if they had not
basically isolated
then when we opened the economy back up
if they hadn't been
many of them wearing mask as they are
today uh these deaths numbers would have
been significantly higher i don't think
there's any doubt about that but no i
mean it was hard to envision
and you know that many deaths uh as far
as
um what percentage of these
5 000 people had an other medical
problem
i can't answer that but we do know
that a large number of those individuals
were over 70.
uh we also know that many many of them
who say we're not over 70 had some other
medical problem so i think that's
that's pretty pretty plain but it
doesn't
at least for me and i hope for most
people
changed the fact that these were fellow
ohioans who are alive
who had people who loved them who had a
life ahead
who were seemed to be doing okay
and some of whom may have lived many
many years
and they were taken away from us by this
vicious
virus so the each one of these lives is
is precious uh and i know you did not
say this
but sometimes people say to me uh well
he was over 70. or he was sick
already or she was sick already
well they're still human beings they
still have people that love them they
love people they had a future they
wanted a future
their family wanted them around uh and
sadly they are they're gone
uh that is not to mention when we talk
about the 5 000 that's not to mention
the people who've just gone through hell
and we've had several of them on
skyped in uh who thought they might die
who were separated from their family for
months
and who made it and so we're blessed to
have them back but they suffered greatly
we also have people
uh who have recovered but who have
term uh damage lung capacity
uh organ some organ damage so the 5 000
is each one's a person each one's a
picture
each one um you know was a great tragedy
but there's also a lot of other people
among us who have suffered
who don't show up in that column but
they come certainly come in another
column
next question is from dustin nsinger at
gangwar news service
good afternoon governor the state has so
far managed to avoid tapping into the
rainy day fund but you previously said
that you expect to use all 2.7 billion
dollars
is that still the plan and do you have
any specifics on where you would like to
use that money to fill
gaps well money's fungible i mean you
can move it around
so you know it's going to
enable us to provide basic services
starting with education
um to the citizens of the state of ohio
so we've taken a conservative approach
i'll be honest about that
um you know we think you know while i'm
optimistic about what's going to happen
whether it's next july or whenever it is
that this virus
uh you know we have the hurt immunity
and we're
you know moving forward uh even a lot
faster than we are today
you know i think we're going to rebound
fast i think we're going to come back
but i don't know that for sure and uh
you know we're going to spend all this
we believe we'll spend all this money
over the next several years
and it will be there primarily to do
what a rainy day fund is for
and that is to make sure that basic
services are provided to the people of
ohio particularly those people who are
the most in need
and so our our plan has not changed
our our plan would be to spend it uh
probably probably spend all of it but
spend it over a period
of probably a couple years you know what
we did
to get through the first to end up last
year
you know we made a cut made some cuts
and you know we pulled some other things
back in we did a hiring freeze we did
other things we got on top of it early
but we wanted to save this money frankly
so that we could level that out
as we as we move forward that's still
our goal
next question is from jeff reddick at
wsyx in columbus
good afternoon again governor uh two
questions for you
one of them being you said a lot off the
top about it's going to get rough
we need to prepare to get rough you've
said in the past we won't shut the
economy down again
would that be in any way no restrictions
on
businesses that would cause shutdowns
secondly we're seeing a lot about the
states are not number going up could you
go over
what you know of it is it continuing to
rise
yeah there are not numbers about two
weeks behind
just by by its nature um
and so yeah you're seeing you're seeing
it go up uh
it is we don't like that it's above one
statewide but not a lot above one
statewide uh but again it's a lagging
it's a really a lagging
uh number and it's an important number
we look at it
it's on my 42 pages that i get every
morning
when i get up uh but it's um
you know it's one of many indicators i
mean it's one of the indicators when i
said every indicator is going the wrong
way
that included the are not number uh
which is what what
what that spread is um
you referenced the first part of your
question i think to
you know potential uh shutdown and let
me just
make it real clear
when i say we're going to have a tough
winter this is pretty much what
you know we're seeing numbers go the
wrong way in ohio
uh and by the way we're not alone we're
seeing these numbers i talked to a
number of governors yesterday
on the phone midwest governors
i talked to governor cuomo talked with
governor
beshear whitmer and and on and on
and these these states are a lot of
these states particularly the midwest
are seeing
the same things we're seeing we're
seeing a real upswing in the rural areas
more generally more than the urban uh
and they're seeing an
increase in cases so we're all kind of
seeing the same
the same thing
but we can the point that i want to make
sure
i get across is that when i say it's
going to be a rough winter it could be a
rough winter it's based on two things
the numbers we're seeing now
and what the experts say what happens
when you move inside
but we can mitigate that a lot we can
change that future
dramatically and i will say what i've
said
other times while we have in some areas
of the state
very good mass wearing um i was on the
phone this morning with
most of our health directors and in some
counties they're
they're seeing a retrenchment they're
seeing that mass worrying go down a
little bit
and you know if we can keep it up if we
could do
85 or so statewide
every county this winter will be a lot
easier
and what really is at stake is all the
things we value
and it's not going to be whether i shut
the state down or don't shut the state
down
if the outbreak is so bad that you can't
put teachers in a classroom
then you can't put students in a
classroom these kids will be
learning remotely whatever the school
wants to do they will have to make they
will ultimately make that decision
out of necessity uh if the outbreak is
is bad uh people will become even more
nervous uh you know will become nervous
about going out
and they'll become nervous about
spending money and so
all of these things so much of our
economy and so much of our future
during the next three months or so
depends on what we do
you know i talked about two things are
coming together
uh never in the history of the countries
or the world as far as i know as
vaccines have been put together as
quickly
and we're not there yet but it looks
like talking to you know you talk to the
experts
that we're on a pathway so we're going
to get these
uh and we can't control that that's what
other people are doing
but what we can control is what we do
ourselves
and that is back to basics
uh one of the things i love loved about
the coaches
ad uh is because in this
as in all sports it does come down
really
uh to your optimism to your heart
and it comes back to doing the basics
every sport everything you do in life
it's about doing the basics
we know what the basics are here and if
we can do these basics we will change
that outcome
so i didn't come here today on this
absolutely beautiful day in ohio
uh to talk gloom
i'm optimistic we've done well
but it's a crucial period uh numbers are
going the wrong way we're coming into
winter
and so we've got to buckle down and
we've got to do what we need to do and
when we do that
that mask again becomes our ticket it's
our ticket
for our kids to play ball our grandkids
my case uh it's our ticket
uh for kids kids to be in school in
person
uh it's our ticket to be able to go out
and about
uh it's our ticket to be able to go to a
restaurant go to a bar that's where our
ticket is
and if enough of us wear it we'll have
the ability to do that if we don't
it could be it could be a tough tough
winter so
the choice lies with us it really does
all of us
collectively you know 11.7 million
ohioans
it really comes down to what we do
next question is from joe ingles at ohio
public radio and television
good afternoon governor
i know you've said that you feel like
the freedom of speech should be their
political speech should be protected
when candidates are coming to ohio
but in many cases and especially
cases involving president trump and and
republican rallies
um they are the people who come don't
know
observe the mask mandate the presenters
themselves don't observe the mass
mandate
they ignore distance spacing and every
time they come to ohio
employees people who are not part of the
event
people who have nothing to do with
having a choice to be there
have to work in those conditions uh
where that's not being practiced you are
friends with with the republican leaders
have you talked to them to at least urge
them
to follow the protocol and have you
talked to the president
to ask him to try to uh get
you know people to wear masks and and
practice
uh more safe distancing and that sort of
thing
yeah it's it's no secret what my
position is on mask
i mean you know everybody in ohio is
sick of me talking about mass
and i think you know they understand at
the white house what my position is
as well but you know joe
i want to take it one step further what
you just said about a rally
is the same thing about any other
gathering
and that is that people who don't wear a
mask
it's not just about protecting
themselves by not wearing a mask they
could very well be endangering other
people
who they don't know who they you know
who aren't the art related to
let alone relate to the people they're
related to so
you know our message has been clear uh
crystal clear
uh from black lives matter from
demonstrations
uh to trump rallies to chur
church gatherings and that has been
please wear a mask
um you know and the evidence is
overwhelming
the jury is returned there is no it is a
unanimous verdict
and that is that mass do in fact work um
and you know there are some there is
some evidence now um
that not only do they help the other
person
not only do they help you getting it
uh but if
you're wearing you're wearing a mask and
let's say you're out
and you know the other person maybe is
not wearing a mask you get
some of this there's some indication
from some scientists
that the severity of
how well or how much you how much you
suffer
how severe is that case may be related
may be mitigated and taken down by that
by that mask
so we're clear on the message
you know we can't control everything um
you know the biggest
cause of spread that we're seeing uh
is people uh you know when they're with
friends and family
uh places they feel comfortable and uh
you know they let their guard down as we
all do when people when we're with
friends and we're the family we all let
our guard down but the message is we
can't do that
we've got to assume that everybody has
it even our friends and even our family
because we don't know we just don't know
next question is from laura hancock at
cleveland.com
good afternoon governor afternoon laura
i think we lost you
if governor um if we are heading toward
a second wave
what prediction or what preparations is
the state
making department health your
administration et cetera
to kind of head some of that off yeah i
mean we're
we're on the phone uh every few days
with our hospital
leads in our three big regions of the
state
and we're talking to other hospitals
around the state uh
national guard is involved so you know
because we went through this in the
spring
you know everybody knows what they do if
if the
hospitalization rates go up and we get
more people in icu and more people
um uh you know who have to be on
ventilators for example so
what we're seeing so far is an increase
in hospitalization
uh no area yet is threatened
none of our eight zones are threatened
but everybody's prepared
everybody knows what they'll do uh in
case of a calamity
so teams ready
we don't have to have that happen uh not
only don't we have that happen we can we
can keep this virus
at a slow burn uh until we get
until the firemen come men women the
fire department come and put it out
and that's when the vaccine is here and
we get
widespread use of the vaccine
but until the firemen get here
we've got to control it ourselves and we
control it ourselves with mass
and distance and i cannot
underestimate or can't state strongly
enough
we have it in our hands to control how
much this flares up
when you saw those counties in some
counties at three times now
the level of high incidence three times
it doesn't have to be that way if
tomorrow
everybody in those counties those top 10
counties 20 counties 30
counties everybody put on a mask
everybody keep a distance you can knock
this thing down
in two weeks and your numbers would
start going down
there's absolutely no doubt about we've
seen it happen in ohio
time and time again when a community has
done that
the cases go down it's not rocket
science
next question is from danny eldridge at
hannah news service
hello governor um so there's about 900
million dollars left in the state share
of the cares act can you talk a little
bit about what your plans are for that
money i know
uh arch groups in particular are looking
for uh
funding from that yeah we we hope to
have some money we will have some money
for the arts we'll have
because we know they've been hit very
hard uh we hope to have some money for
other non-profits uh we hope to have
money
uh for small other small businesses and
we hope to have money
for people who are paying rent and are
behind in their rent or behind in their
mortgage
uh so those are we've already put some
money out
uh in regard to mental health
and we're monitoring that um you know we
put out the money that we think can be
spent
between now and the end of the year uh
if this money can be carried over which
we hope it will be and we think that
congress in a lame duck session will
uh vote on a bill if they vote on any
bill i'm told
by our our congressional delegation
there will be a rollover provision in
the bill
uh and then we'll be able to take some
of that money into next year uh when
we're also going to have mental health
concerns where our colleges are also
going to need additional funds uh so for
this year in addition to the things i
talked about we also look to have some
additional money for for our colleges
and our universities so
we have plans what makes it difficult uh
is we still don't know for sure whether
we can roll this money over or whether
we would be in a position
of trying to spend it between now and
the end of the year which would not be a
prudent way to do it it would not be the
most
uh logical way to
to to do that so we're kind of balancing
these things but we have needs now that
we're going to
we're going to get covered we're working
with the state legislature and we should
have a specific announcement
uh about what we're doing shortly
next question is from boniface walmer at
eye on ohio
good afternoon governor um my
question for you is going back to the
vaccinations
um when when you finally receive a
vaccination
how long do you expect it to take before
you can roll it out to all of ohio
well that's an excellent question i
don't know the answer
but i have a general answer and this is
from talking to
the vice president and and talking to
doctors
um you know we think that these
vaccinations will come in waves
um and it looks like most of the ones
that are being worked on
require two shots i think one of the
main ones being worked on is a three
week period between the first shot
and the second shot another one is a
four week period between the first shot
and in the second and the second shot um
you know some of them require uh you
know deep deep freeze
uh but they're gonna come out in
containers that can be can and hold them
um and you know we've already are
working on the distribution
chain we would expect that the first
group that would come out you know will
certainly be
focused on uh critical first responders
and by that i mean people people who are
you know who are right on the front line
um it also you know very early on will
be people who
are the most vulnerable uh that
certainly is anybody
who's living in a you know people who
are living in a congregate setting
such as nursing homes so we think it's
going to come out in waves and it's
going to pick up faster and faster
probably as it goes no one knows how
long this is going to take but
you know several knowledgeable people
who've looked at this
have told me by june or late june
they would project that we would be in
widespread distribution
you know to people all over the country
not just in niche groups or smaller
groups but it would be widespread now
look those
you know those dates are just no one
really knows
people are trying to kind of figure it
out but uh
you know we're moving towards uh you
know
working on it so no matter when it comes
out we'll be ready to get it out and our
goal will be to
obviously get these out just as soon as
we get our hands on them
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
max hey governor um i remember a month
ago you were warning ohioans um with
labor day approaching
that uh if they weren't careful we could
see cases spike again
so i'm curious if you believe that the
spike we're currently seeing
is the result of labor day and if that
could lead to any more
um measures that your administration
might implement
since we've got a few more holiday
weekends coming up before the end of the
year
yeah i think max is that's too
simplistic i mean
certainly labor day and activities could
have been a partial cause
you know you had a lot of things going
on as you know in the week or two before
schools were opening back up and
colleges were opening back up and our
colleges have kind of phased in
uh you know some of the colleges opened
up entirely in person and some kind of
phased that
in so we're well into all of that now
uh and you know what we think we're
seeing as we're seeing an
uptick now in the age
which is different than it's been for a
number of months that we're seeing kind
of a rebound
so you know you get a college 20 year
old college student who has got infected
he or she might not even know they have
it they pass it on to
an older person and we think we're
seeing that second phase
of that uh possibly taking place but
it's very difficult to
you know to drill down and and to
quantify that so
um again um
you know you asked your other question
was you know
is that going to inform us to do
anything in in particular
uh and what it informs me to do
is to just emphasize to people we
control this this is in our
in our our in our collective hands i
mean when you think about it
if if we're correct that
so much of this is coming about from
people who are with family and with
friends whether the wedding
or a funeral or
a barbecue or any kind of things that
people do
you know government has very little way
to impact that other than to tell people
here's what's going on in your county
here are the numbers in your county
and in second here's what you can do
about it
and you know telling them
we know this works we have evidence that
works we have evidence in ohio it works
as well as national evidence so you know
if you just listen to the experts you
know there's dr fauci who
who said i think one of our uh leading
doctors uh
you know said basically that uh uh
now there's another doctor whose name
but anyway basically said that the
the mask in in some respects is going to
be more
redfield i think uh mask is gonna be
more powerful than the
immunization i don't know about that but
it just tells you how much she thinks
this mass
is worth and we saw it on numbers
i mean we can show you graphs we can
show you what happened
uh when our early cities for example put
on
mass orders and then we came we came in
right shortly after that
and put in a mass score for the entire
county and you can see what happened
in those counties and it's phenomenal
you started to seeing
the mask worrying go up dramatically and
then you start seeing cases go down
that doesn't mean they don't struggle
doesn't mean they still don't have
problems
but we know we can show or the mask
worrying in ohio has fundamentally
changed the outcome
and look we're not trying to be alarmist
but if you're a county with
two and a half times three times the
positivity
there's no way it doesn't get into your
schools there's no way it doesn't get
into your most vulnerable people
as your your loved ones your
grandparents your great-grandparents
your aunts your uncles who are in the
nursing homes so
you know it's imperative if you live in
one of those counties
to get control of this virus and it's
not that
hard it is simply you know
erecting barriers so it doesn't pass
from one person to the other and and the
best you know this is amazing barrier
uh and when both people are wearing them
it's it's it's really really
good next question is from justin dennis
at mahoningmatters.com
hi governor um since we're talking about
mass the mass mandate has been difficult
to enforce at the local level and
if this is as you say our ticket away
from the dangers of the pandemic
how can you uh strengthen enforcement
measures is there anything new that we
can do
to ensure compliance um aside from from
leaving it up to everyone to
to make their own decision yeah i mean
we're gonna you know where we have the
most
ability to control uh it's frankly in
any establishment that sells liquor
because we can send in agents
and we do uh and if they're not
following mass compliance or they're not
following
distance requirements then those agents
can can cite them into the state liquor
board
so in in those cases doesn't mean we
catch everything but we have the ability
certainly to go in and and to do that
uh but where we're seeing you know a
great great bulk of this
spread is is families and and people
just hey doing things that normally are
great things to do um our message is you
can still do those
but you just got to be careful and fran
i've been a few funerals in the last
couple few weeks unfortunately and you
can do them you can do them safely
uh and everybody can and you can pay
honor to the
loved one and see the family and do
these things but
when you're talking about enforcement
there is a limit to what government
should do
and there's a limit to what government
can do and uh you know
we can't go into someone's backyard you
know we can't go inside their home
we can't go inside that fraternity home
uh we
you know these are these are things that
we don't have the people to do it
but again if we're gonna get through
this
and whatever you like to do whatever is
important to you
wearing a mask and keeping distance is
the way to preserve the ability to do
that
and we're going to continue to talk
about that and in
events that we can control uh sporting
events for example you know it's
incumbent upon the people to enforce it
who run it when they don't run it that
way then that there's a problem
so we can do this in some areas but when
people's most
personal private things what parts of
life
where we're seeing the most spread
frankly
it's tough it's not easy
next question is from tom jackson at the
sandusky register
hey tom hi governor thanks for taking my
question um as you pointed out we're
getting a big rise
in cases although fortunately deaths
have not been spiking
can you give me an idea uh on whether
any lockdown measures
are likely to be brought back this
winter if things keep going
south for example could there be more
restrictions on bars and restaurants
if uh your appeals for people to follow
social distancing and aware
mass don't seem to be having any effect
yeah i mean i think there could be but i
think the more likely thing to happen
is that the market itself people
themselves
will will react
and i use the example of schools we've
seen some schools
that started open five days a week
who've now pulled back at least
temporarily
maybe maybe to totally virtual or to a
hybrid
why have they done it well they had some
outbreaks they had some cases they
couldn't
put teachers in in a classroom or they
were you know had too many students who
were
who were out so that's what's going to
happen this virus
will have have the impact right on the
ground right at the local level
and people will have to adjust to that
so you know again the best way to stop
that from doing is
people in the community to understand
what they do directly impacts what goes
on that nursing home or directly impacts
what goes on in that in that school
i want to i want to mention something
about the deaths because you make you
make a good
point um you know i think that and i i
said this early on
um if you can avoid if if you had to get
this
you'd want to get it as late as you
could in the game because medical
science is
getting better and better they're
learning uh they know what
drugs to use and what things to use
there's no cure but
they can mitigate the damage and they
can save more lives so we would continue
to expect
i think our medical professionals would
say this that they will continue to
expect to
save more lives the further along in
this that we go
but the other thing to keep in mind
before we get too happy about
how we're doing uh or too optimistic uh
is that deaths are of course the last
indicator it's the
the lagging lagging indicator i mean you
go
you go through a long process and you
know someone you know is infected
someone then notices it or somehow they
take a test and now they know they've
got it
and at some point they get so bad they
go to the hospital
and then you know they may be in the
hospital for an extended period of time
we hope they get out but if they end up
dying that may be in
that you know bigger period of time so
they're the lagging lagging lagging
indicators so when you see these numbers
as high as they are today
um you know we may see those results you
know
two three four weeks weeks away so
uh we're doing better uh in you know not
because of me but because of what
doctors and scientists are doing
but um we're still losing people
and there's no cure that we know of
next question is from jackie borchardt
at the cincinnati enquirer
jackie good afternoon um governor you
said earlier that if we got to 80 to 90
compliance for wearing masks and
counties that would make a huge
difference where are we at now and how
are you measuring that
that's a good question you know there
are some
apps that are supposedly doing this i've
never been quite sure how reliable they
are
i will tell you what we do on this
morning 7 15
call with the health departments i ask
each one of them to report to us
today um what they think their
mass compliance is in their community
and i'll be happy to share those with
you all um on thursday
uh it varies and it varies within the
county
uh here's what some of my district reps
who i've sent out and
they're not health experts but they just
have gone out and just looked
and what they'll say is that in the
rural counties for urban counties has
the most compliance generally
you get out into the rural counties uh
the county seat has less than the urban
areas but more than
the rest of the county so you go into a
county and the county seat will have the
highest
highest rate of compliance you know
maybe 40
50 uh and but then when you go out into
the smaller communities it may go down
to 10
or less um it also depends on the type
store
uh you know what they tell us is that
grocery stores do pretty well the
highest incidence
uh the highest compliance level is
probably in the grocery stores
for whatever reason convenience stores
on the other hand
uh are some of the lowest that's what's
reported to us
this is consistent county to county uh i
don't know whether
you know why that is but again it's
it matters it makes a great deal of
difference
um you know we got frontline workers uh
they're not all
in the medical field or the nursing home
field we have front line workers who
work in grocery stores and um you know
somebody's out stalking shelves and
they've got a mask on and you don't
and everybody else doesn't it's not fair
it's not fair to them really it's not
but
we'll try to get you that and at least
share with you what we have it
again it's not that scientific but
you can come fairly close um
you know to knowing what's going on in
the in the county
next question is from jack windsor at
wmfd
in mansfield hey jack governor
follow up on last week since then we've
learned schools are not super spreaders
according to a brown university study
confirming what the cdc said in july
lockdowns cause mass poverty and the
benefits of normal education outweigh
risks according to the world health
organization
eighty-five percent of those who masked
contracted covet while only three
percent of those who didn't mask
contracted the virus according to the
cdc and then bio next now
the tests that you want to use in our
schools are approved for off-label use
but the test manufacturer does not
recommend them for use on asymptomatic
people
and nearly all the children who are
positive or asymptomatic we're also
receiving anecdotal reports of kids
suffering infections heart conditions
and kidney issues due to masking
and 10 months in not one child under 18
has died from covid
governor can you get kids back in school
full time without the dangerous demand
of masking
unnecessary testing and can we stop the
unethical 14-day quarantine of healthy
kids
well jeff my answer is probably the same
as it was last week
i don't know that as much much different
um
we we do know um
the kids can spread it you use the term
super spray
it's a different thing uh and what we're
seeing where the super spreading events
generally are uh or at weddings uh
they're at when people are inside there
are people close together
they're when people are shouting people
singing people crying
you know these are places where we have
seen a lot of the super spreader events
and so super spreader events we've not
seen uh in
to my knowledge in in in our schools uh
we have had
some kids uh who get get the virus
uh but we don't think um that by and
large
most of these kids are getting that
virus in school uh we think that spread
in school is
is not huge uh from
what we can see we think the schools are
doing a very good job
you know you can certainly get a
pretty good indication of what is going
on and so we have not
in our schools unless some child is
symptomatic
um you know testing has not been very
widespread
so we get back to the question that many
superintendents have raised to us
and they've said sally's sitting here
turns out that she's got coven say she
got it from her dad
or whatever she's got it now we know
that now we go back and see who she sat
with
and these for the schools that can't
separate by six feet
this is where we get into the question
and we try to follow what the cdc said
and the local health department is
trying to follow that
and what they have basically said is
that and they've said very specifically
that if while masked or important even
though both parties are wearing masks if
they're within six feet of each other
and
they're together more than 15 minutes
that other person should be quarantined
now i understand why parents are upset i
understand why
superintendents are questioning that we
went back to our health people
and not just work in the health
department i'm talking about people at a
major
major universities hospitals
and to a person they said we don't think
you can go away from that
we can't advise that without any data
so we're going to try to get some data
we're going to try to you know look at
what people what kids who have been in
that situation
and testing them very frequently after
that
let them stay in class let them stay in
school and see kind of what we come up
with and see if they actually do develop
that virus the fear all along from the
health experts
at least as i understand it going back
to when schools were closed
has been that particularly kids over 10
can in fact
i mean any child can get it but children
over 10 are more likely to be spreaders
and so you take that back you know even
if they're have no symptoms
never know they've got it they go take
it back to their family and it spreads
out from there
but we continue to learn uh we continue
to get data
and we're trying to you know inform what
we do in ohio by that data and we're
going to do our own
our own uh uh experiment under the
guidance of
the ohio state university and see what
comes with that and
take that information and help it inform
what we do
next question is from laura bischoff at
the dayton daily news
hello
we'll come back to laura next question
is adrian robbins
at wcmh in columbus
hi governor thank you so much for doing
this again today
we're learning more information on the
plot to kidnap the governor of michigan
including that the governor of virginia
was a target that was talked about
does this concern you about your own
safety but also when it comes to the
rise of these extremist groups
we are seeing across the nation so
including here in ohio
are you concerned about the safety of
all ohioans
yes as far as the last question i am
concerned about
the safety of ohioans look the rise in
extremist groups
is something that we have to be
concerned about
fbi did a great job uh in protecting
governor whitmer
but as far as all citizens yeah we have
to be concerned about these the
the neo-nazis with the white
supremacists um
you know all we have to be concerned
about all these fringe
groups of right or left whichever
political
side you say they're on but we have to
be very concerned about them
and um you know that's that's
the thing that we as elected officials
have to do is to you know
denounce them as i have and i will
continue to do so so yes i'm concerned
about them
i'm concerned about it sometimes it's
one it's a one-off it's one person
one person they get this in their head
and they're going to do something
sometimes it's as in the case apparently
where governor whitmer was the victim or
would have been the victim uh you know
it's a plot it's a it's a whole
conspiracy
it's a group of people who apparently
trained for this and were
you know so audacious that they thought
that they could they could pull
they could pull this off uh so you know
look as far as my security um
we don't talk about security so i you
know i don't talk about
our security so it's just not it's not
it's not a wise thing
really to do next question we'll go back
to laura bischoff at the dayton daily
news
hey laura uh can you hear me now
i can hear you well thank you excellent
hey it's been 85 days since larry
householder and four others were
arrested in that 60 million
bribery and racketeering case ohio
lawmakers haven't moved yet to repeal or
replace house bill 6. i know you've
called for
it to be repealed
the special can the select committee in
the house didn't meet last week it's not
meeting this week
what kind of discussions have you had
with legislative leaders about
the future of that of that law
in recent days sure sure uh i mean we've
talked we've certainly have talked about
this about the importance of
it passing uh that it needs to pass
you know i get the impression uh that
the lame duck session may be a very uh
interesting session and i hope very very
productive
as i said at the beginning of this you
know we've got a
uh some language that we need to include
in the
in the code in regard to repeat violent
offenders uh there's
police reform that needs to take place
and i think there's a broad consensus
among police officers and others uh
police organizations and
and community groups so there are things
that we should be able to pass
in the lame duck the legislature should
be able to pass and i would be willing
to sign
one sign so we hope i certainly hope
that this is one of the things that they
deal with
so i'm my position has not changed lord
next question is from alex ebert at
bloomberg
thanks for your time governor last week
the united states second largest
movie theater chain said it was going to
temporarily close down
i'm a big fan of taking my daughter out
to the movies and i'm sure
everyone in central ohio has seen the
amc over eastern town center
is there anything the state is going to
do to try to prop up
movie theaters and theaters in general
during these hard times to prevent them
from closing
thank you sir yeah well fran i
love movies and uh love taking grandkids
love just going
fran and i uh we go to a little art
theater in yellow springs and we go to
other places uh so it's it's always
something we we enjoy very very much
we do have we
can't announce this yet but in the
money that we're setting aside
we hope to have money and we'll have
money for theaters performing arts
theaters uh in in ohio you know if it's
not going to
put them back where they were where they
would have been but we will have money
in there for that
i don't anticipate money um directly
for movie theaters although they may
qualify
under under something else
governor next question is the last
question today and it belongs to marty
schleyton at the ohio capitol journal
hi governor how are you i'm good sir
good
um you are undertaking a process
to uh make medicaid more effective in
ohio and
bring about better health outcomes but
at the same time you're uh
supporting a nominee to the supreme
court who's going to have a
vote on the aca on well if she's on the
court uh sometime after november 10th
and she's been critical of uh earlier
george prudence upholding it um are you
concerned that she may strike down the
aca
and that about a half a million ohioans
are covered under the expansion
population might lose their insurance
in addition to all the people who have
protections for their pre-existing
conditions now
that they might lose yeah thank you for
the question
i think there's a real consensus in this
country
and among members of congress governors
of the pre-existing has to be covered
that nothing that has that hole has to
be filled
has to be covered keeping insurance
until your child is 26
has to be covered there are other things
that clearly have to be covered where i
think that
we've emerged in this country there has
emerged clearly clearly a
a consensus judge barrett i believe
is a stellar candidate um i
didn't watch much of the hearings today
just kind of walked by the tv a few
times and saw it
but looked like she was holding her own
and doing well
you know she's eminently qualified she
has a great background
i think she'll be a great great justice
and i think we are we're done good look
forward to seeing uh everyone on
on thursday and i hope you have a good
uh
rest of the day thank you very much
[Music]
you
