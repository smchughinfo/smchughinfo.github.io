good afternoon everyone we are back
at our home in in cedarville lieutenant
governor is in columbus and we have
three doctors who are going to be
joining us from
from all over the states we appreciate
that very much
because we're in cedarville we can't do
our split
screen with our american sign language
interpreters
so instead today's uh update
uh in american sign language is
available live from
opportunities for ohioans with
disabilities so you can search
ohio ood to find interpreting live
on facebook and youtube or you can go
directly to these links
directly the links are facebook.com
ohiod or
youtube.com
ohiod
also if you're not able to watch live
you could access
the videos later on these channels or on
the ohio
channel i'm wearing a
green tie today for two reasons it was
sent to me by lake erie college in
painesville ohio
lake erie college can trace its
beginnings back to
willoughby female seminary which was
founded in 1847.
uh the seminary was then the only
institution of higher education for
women
in the western reserve as one of the
oldest institutions for higher learning
in the western reserve lake erie college
is certainly proud of its long heritage
from its start as a female seminary to a
co-educational institution of today
offering
undergraduate and graduate degrees to
individuals of all ages
the college has been a leader in higher
education in ohio
for 160 years i'm also wearing the green
tie today to recognize that august is
child support awareness month
and all those who work in this area uh
thank you what you're doing is very very
important
work the ohio shots child support
program
serves more than a million children and
collected nearly two billion dollars in
support for them over
the last year uh on the good news front
i'll let you know that
director annette chambers smith the ohio
department of rehabilitation and
corrections
is better she was diagnosed with covin
she has now been cleared to return to
work although frankly i know that she's
been working from home
we're all very grateful that she's
recovered and we continue to wish her
the best for a great great recovery
this is a kind of a special press
conference today
where a focus is going back to school
we know in ohio we don't have a set date
for when kids go back to school this is
determined by the schools determined by
the school district for our public
schools
we're going to today hear from three
prominent doctors
who specialize in children's health dr
john
bernard from nationwide children's
hospital in columbus
dr patty manning from cincinnati
children's hospital
and dr adam mazoff from dayton
children's hospital
but first let's let's start with our
normal
numbers and look at some other other
numbers as well
so first start with our
data slides which should be coming up on
on your screen
good news we're seeing a little downturn
as far
as the number of cases 1095
in the last 24 hours our deaths uh
sadly were 35 that were reported
hospitalizations are up 131 and icu
admissions are up a little bit as well
at 19. let's go to uh the next
chart eric this is a chart that we
showed you
last week and this is kind of a little
sneak preview we've been putting these
out on
wednesday but you can see the states
this is the what we call the travel
advisory
uh just like when you go overseas
there's sometimes a travel advisory well
this is a travel advisory for the six
states uh there are 15 percent
positivity
uh or or above uh in those states you
can see we
we start out with with idaho at 17
percent
uh nevada is 19 uh arizona is 18
and then we go over to mississippi uh at
26 percent uh alabama
20 uh in florida at 18.
uh as you know we've been running a
little bit
uh over five and uh five positivity so
some of these states are
five times what our what our positivity
is we just ask people to be careful when
they come back
we would we would ask them if we have
visitors from those states
quarantine we'd also ask ohioans who go
there
when they get back be very very careful
for 14 days and accord
quarantine uh eric let's go to our
regular slide
this is not new uh we're going to be
getting a new one in two days
but again you know one of the things
we're going to be talking about today is
going back to school
we're going to show a map in a moment
prepared by by the ohio department of
education
uh which shows what school districts are
going back in
in person so again this shows the trend
that we have been seeing
again the same map we had last week on
thursday but you'll see that you'll see
the red
counties there you also see that we get
fewer and fewer of the yellow
yellow counties so eric let's go to the
next
slide we started a couple weeks ago
ranking counties by positivity
this is 1 through 88 and these are new
numbers
these are new numbers as of yesterday
and excuse me i misspoke i didn't mean
to say positivity these are actually
ranked
by order of how many
cases they had in the last two weeks
per hundred thousand population so it
evens things out
based upon the population uh and what
you will see
eric we can go the next slide which is
uh the top ten
it's a little easier to see these are
the top ten we'll hold on there a minute
uh mercer county still
number one champaign county number two
and dark county number three so we start
off with three relatively small counties
or more rural counties
uh that have the highest amount of of
cases per population
for the last 14 days we then go to lucas
then we go another smaller county not in
geography but in the population
that's lawrence county then in central
ohio
perry county again another smaller
county fairfield kind of a mid-sized
county
and then franklin and then clear over in
the eastern side of the state columbiana
and then seneca seneca county
as well again
keep these in mind as we as we will be
looking in a minute
about where schools are going in
columbiana county two long-term care
facility outbreaks
one facility had a large number of cases
they have concerns about large venue
events
including flea markets where they were
seeing no facial
coverings or very few people and not
much social distancing
also note uh that the junior fair i hear
from my friends in columbiana county
went very well and it was a very
safe safe fair so we thank them for that
seneca county
also we start off with a flea market and
when i talked a few days ago to on
monday
monday morning i talked to all our
health directors around the state
113 health directors i think there's 80
some that are actually on there
but one of the things they they talked
about was flea markets not just in
columbiana county and seneca county but
in other
other counties in addition
we've seen some incidents in regard to
seneca county with weddings
also in seneca county long-term care
facility we've seen an outbreak
[Music]
so those are some of the things that
that we're seeing with those
two counties we'll have more of all our
counties uh on thursday when we when you
do
when we do our our up update
uh just a comment about about flea
markets
we would just remind everyone that flea
markets are a lot of fun
should be pretty safe they're outdoors
usually they're outdoors not always
but usually outdoors people can come and
have a good time and look around
but i would just remind everyone who's
in charge of the flea markets please do
everything you can to keep the social
distancing
uh people should be wearing masks when
when they are there
so again anyone who's going to flea
market have fun
anybody who's running a flea market uh
hope you do well
but uh please please careful
eric let's go now to a chart uh and this
goes directly to
some of the things that we've been uh
we're going to talk about today and this
is
this is young people and we've shown
this chart before this is kind of
kind of an update in in the chart let me
get it out here
um this is percentage of cases by age
group
and if you look at the age group of 0 to
19
if you go back to march it was only 2.4
percent of our total cases
today it's almost 13 of our total cases
our people
young people 0 to 19. if you go the next
level down age 20 to 29 in march it was
12 percent
and now it is about 19.4 percent
a little bit less than it was in july
and what it was in
in june so just it's kind of interesting
to see
uh see that that breakout
uh eric let's go to again the map okay
this is our map again and let's
flip beyond that eric and we'll go to
a map that was done education model
map this is done by the state department
of education
and it as of august 6. so some of you
may have seen this
uh i know the dayton daily carried it
uh there may have been other papers that
have carried this map
as well but let me kind of go through
this
because this is
i'd ask the department to prepare a map
to kind of show us
how many of our kids are going back to
school
in person how many school districts are
going to start
remotely and then how many are doing a
hybrid
so as you look at this let's start
with what is kind of a light yellow
at least on on my screen this is
uh schools are planning when they start
back
in to go basically live
uh with students in the schools
um this is referred to as a five-day
return simply meaning that kids are
going to go back in school like
pretty much as they normally would this
is in-person instruction
sometimes the schedules will be adjusted
and of course the configuration of
school may be
adjusted but this is kids who will be
there
in in person so that's the light yellow
the blue that's all remote
those are students that are going all
remote and you'll see
a lot of our urban centers or
or city schools or going uh remote
online learning
all students uh will receive only remote
learning instruction
which may be teacher-led or student-led
but it will be remote at least
at the beginning this is how they're
going to start off
green the green that you see there is a
hybrid model a mix of in-person
and remote learning education knowing
that some grade levels may be
all in in person or fully remote so it's
a real mix
there so again the yellow is in person
that's how they intend to start uh the
blue is they're intending to
at least start uh online uh learning
completely
and the green is the hybrid or the
combination of
of those two um
a couple things about this information
and some qualifications
to it this is what we know today
actually back
a few days ago on august 6. it is public
schools only
so we don't have there
the parochial schools or any kind of
private schools
it only captures traditional public
school districts and it does not capture
all the subtleties of our hybrid models
where different grade levels may be
going in per
person or in fact maybe going remote
so based on what we know now
we have 325 school districts
in the state who are planning to return
full-time
that represents about 590 000 public
school students or
38 percent roughly these are all rough
figures but approximately 38 percent
of students would be going back to
school
uh in in person
we have 55 districts for about 25.6
percent
or 398 000 students
uh that will be fully remote so again
that's 55 districts 25.6 percent
uh of the of the school population will
be going at least starting off
online we have 154 districts
or 24.5 percent
which is approximately 380 000 students
will be doing some for
some form of hybrid schooling there are
78 districts uh for which a few days ago
we did not have the data
on and so some school districts are
still deciding
uh and in some cases maybe we just don't
have that in
information so that kind of gives you a
uh an idea
uh gives me an idea of kind of what is
happening
as schools are making individual choices
and of course as parents are making
individual choices
let me just talk for a moment before we
get to our three doctors
i'm anxious to to hear what they have to
say
but as we
look at our schools
and i've talked to a lot of
superintendents i've talked to a lot of
teachers
um and let me just say uh i think our
schools are doing a very good job
uh getting ready uh those that are going
to be online or those that are going to
be in person i think they're doing a
good job they've been working
very very hard for those who
are going to start either hybrid or
totally in person i think
they're going to do a very very good job
look
our teachers our principals
folks that just work in this school
that's in the cafeteria or wherever it
is
every day they work hard when there's no
covet
to protect our kids i've known a lot of
teachers
over the years related to some
and they do a phenomenal phenomenal job
and so i have every confidence
that they're going to do everything that
they can and have taken every precaution
they can
to keep your children or your
grandchildren safe when they go back
to school one thing i pointed out
as i had some discussions this past week
with school superintendents
and i've said to them i have i'm totally
confident
that you're going to do a great job
you've been focusing on this you've been
getting ready for this
but whatever is going on
in the community will be reflected in
your school
you know if it's high coveted spread
throughout the community it's going to
be high
in your school and there's there's
really no way
of changing that so no matter how good
the schools are
they basically get kids coming out of a
community that may be
high and so my plea today to
parents and grandparents and if you
don't have a kid in school
if we want our kids to go to school we
want them to be there in person if we
want them to play sports if we want them
to be
in whatever club they're in whatever
their passion is
and there's nothing better than having
your child cared
a lot about something that might be
sports it might be drama it might be
banned it might be art if you want them
to be able to have that experience then
it's incumbent upon all of us every
single one of us
to do everything we can to keep down the
spread in the community in which that
school lives
and that's the best thing that we can do
the most important thing we can do to
keep our kids in school for those kids
who are going to
start in school and to keep them in
school
and keep them able to go what we do is
going to really frankly determine that
what that community does what we do in
our community and for kids who are
starting online but the
school is looking forward and saying hey
you know maybe after a while we'll be in
a position where
we think we can have kids in school
again what we do in that community is
going to determine whether that
opportunity is there for our kids and
our grandkids and our
our neighbors kids so we all think that
being
in school in person is important
and the way to ensure that is for us to
wear a mask when we're out
keep our social distance not go to mass
gatherings of people or large
gatherings of people and just be careful
stop the spread of it
slow it down um it's really exactly what
we need to do and that's the best thing
that we can do
uh if we have a real passion for having
our kids in school and a passion for
having our kids
whether it plays sports or or engage in
art whatever the kid likes to do
young people like to do so
that is kind of where we are at this
point let me now go
and i'm really happy to welcome dr john
bernard who is the chief of pediatrics
at nationwide children's hospital and
president
of the research institute at nationwide
children's
doctor uh welcome thank you very very
much for
being with us and i know that i've been
told that you've been leading a team of
physicians and researchers
across some of ohio's children's
hospitals
to analyze the prevalence of cova 19
among children
uh and i wonder if you could just maybe
tell us
uh some of the things that you have
found and kind of what the status is of
uh cover 19 among our young people in
ohio today
thank you governor dewine i am
privileged to speak on behalf of
ohio six children's hospitals which are
are overseen by and
work together under the auspices of the
ohio children's hospital association
for really many many years but certainly
in the covet era
we've been working much more closely
together to share best practices and
ideas and also to collate data
so for the past few months we've shared
our data with one another
and i'll review some of those learnings
with uh with
uh with you today great so first off a
few high-level
comments children get coronavirus
infection let's
let's be really crystal uh clear they
get coronavirus infection and they get
it not infrequently
fortunately most children
are reasonably well with their symptoms
of
of covid19 we know that about 90
of them do really exceedingly well
however a smaller fraction
10 or maybe a little bit less actually
get sick
and need to be in the hospital and
children with certain medical conditions
actually can become critically ill and
have been hospitalized in our
ohio children's hospitals and in our
intensive
care unit so small number get really
sick
most kids do well we're very grateful
for that but just to
make sure folks know it can be a very
serious
disease in certain children now in ohio
children's
hospitals we're privileged to have six
of the country's best
here in ohio we took a different cut at
the
data and we were really interested in
knowing
uh what fraction of children what
percentage of children who have symptoms
that are compatible with covid
actually tests positive so we've done
over the course of the past five-ish
months
we've done about 14 000 tests
for covid in children that have symptoms
that suggest to our physicians that
may be compatible with covid and we
found 8.6
positivity we're also
interested in the test positivity in
children that don't have
signs or symptoms of covid and we're not
out surveying in the community so how
can we get a
best estimate of that well we are most
of us are testing all the children
admitted to our hospitals
whether they have coveted life symptoms
or not and we're also testing children
that are going to
undergo surgery uh in the near future
that's an outpatient elective surgery
so that's as close as we can come to a
to a asymptomatic
population which has been talked about
very frequently in the
late press and also in the medical
journals and since
mid-march when we first started testing
we've done about 20 000
tests and these asymptomatic children
and we find that a positive rate from
the beginning of about 1.4
now i would like to point out that that
number has been rising in the past
a month or so and as as uh now at about
2.9
if you just look back for the the prior
week
so we do think that there's some
increase in the number of children that
are asymptomatic
but test positive from for covid
and by the way i do want to say that the
information that i'm giving you today
is in children that are basically
less than 18 years of age
we have also broken down our data by age
we're very interested in
in um the spread from age zero to
to age 18 and we have found that
that older teenagers or really young
adults at the age of
17 are the highest prevalence of test
positivity amongst
all the children that we all the
children that we
test and we believe that's because 17
year olds are now dolphin driving
and they are socially much more
active and tend to test positive
statistically significantly
more than younger children now let me
talk a little bit more about
the severity of the disease so
of all the children that we've
encountered that have been
a positive across the state eight
percent have
required admissions admission to one of
our children's
hospital and of those eight percent
one percent have had to go into our
intensive care unit and some
have been really critically ill and on
ventilator
so again it can be a very serious
disease in children and some of these
cases
occur in children with underlying
medical conditions such as
obesity and type 2 diabetes type 1
diabetes for
example the last thing i would like to
say
just about the types of children that
are getting coveted in our
in our state is that we have learned
that the prevalence of test
positivity is four to six times
higher in children from underrepresented
minority
groups specifically hispanic children
and black children that's an observation
that's really played out across the
united states and it certainly seems to
be
playing out here in ohio and regardless
of the
of the um cities in which our children's
hospitals are
are located so finally
i think many of us have heard about this
multi-system inflammatory
syndrome of children and interestingly
here in ohio we've
had 13 cases that we've identified at
our children's hospital
and far far fewer than some of the hot
spots across the country like new york
miami and others so i think we're
fortunate in that regard in fact some of
our hospitals have not even
even seen the case and i just will
report today
happily that as of this morning at about
seven o'clock none of our children's
hospitals
had children in their intensive care
units being cared for
with covered so a good report for today
at least
well doctor thank you that's a very
thorough and uh
i appreciate it i hope you can uh
stay with us as we may have some
questions uh from
from the news media certainly i'd like
to go i appreciate that very very much
great
great overview of what we're seeing in
ohio what you're seeing in ohio and what
all our children's hospitals are
seeing and um i agree with you we are
blessed with some amazing children's
hospitals in ohio
uh it's just a a great great thing for
for our families let me now welcome
dr pat patty manning dr manning is the
chief of staff
and developmental pediatrician at
cincinnati children's hospital
uh dr manny thank you very very much for
being with us
one if you could tell us maybe
start off with what is
the research telling us about kids being
able to spread the virus
sure thank you governor it's a a
privilege to be able to speak on behalf
of such an important topic on behalf of
the ohio children's hospital association
you know we're really just learning uh
what children do in terms of spread but
i think it's important to restate what
you've already said and what dr barnard
said and that is that
children do get covered they are not
immune from covet and when you have
covid you can spread coping
there's some very early research that
suggests that the type of spread may
differ by the age of child
but it's a preliminary and it's hard to
really um
extend that research beyond just some
initial thoughts about
who might be more contagious i think
it's safe to say that if a child has
covet
they'll they can be contagious whether
they're symptomatic or not
and as we have more time we'll learn
more about what types of children
spread who spreads more it's fair to say
that younger children who need
closer contact in their care might be at
more risk of spread
and so that the younger you are the more
likely you may be to spread because your
care has to be in more close contact
with that but that comes about because
of the
length of time with that child and maybe
also because the closeness with that
child and those are two factors that are
important that's very important a very
good point that
you know we talk a lot about close
contact and what close contact means
uh with regards to transmission so close
contact to remind everyone is under six
feet
for more than 10 or 15 minutes and so as
you're
obviously aware most young children need
close care you have to hold them or you
have to feed them
and you're going to do that for longer
than 10 or 15 minutes
but if you can be distant from older
children more than
three four five six feet and and you can
do that for
uh or when you are close it's under 10
minutes you're at less risk
and then and then doctor you may have
covered this but what about kids over
over 10 the older the teenagers maybe
early teens so the older children and
the teens as we heard a little bit
already especially the teens and the
mobile teams are
a great risk for spread because they're
very active and they're in close contact
with each other
you don't have a lot of evidence that
says that they spread more or they
spread differently but again that's
another area of important study that
we're waiting on
i wonder if you can talk you know
the reason we're doing this today doctor
is as people are getting ready to send
their kids back
back to school and i wonder if you have
based on
your research your knowledge any kind of
tips for
students or parents uh administrators
uh to keep schools safe and i know
schools have been working very hard
uh but we thought we would take this
opportunity to
have you talk directly to people of ohio
and uh
tell them what uh what you know based on
your your uh
your your uh studies and your expertise
absolutely and i i just want to echo
what you said about the hard work that's
being done by all the school leaders and
administrators they have
such a huge lift and the exposure that
i've had to the work that they've done
has been
uh it's been just impressive um what
school leaders are doing to keep our
kids safe
uh and we recognize that opening a
school is a local decision it's a
community decision it's based on many
local factors
as pediatricians we do support and are
biased in the direction of
in person education when possible
and for that education to be safe there
are really
four very specific strategies in order
of importance that we want schools
and families to be aware of the first is
masking
that everyone can wear a mask everyone
should wear a mask it's recommended that
children in k
through 12 wear masks that will protect
everyone teachers and students
the second is distancing and so we talk
a lot about the importance of distancing
in six feet
and six feet is optimal six feet is
great but three feet is also good
and four feet's a little bit better than
three feet and five feet is better than
four feet
and so we know there's a continuum of
safety uh that can be in place in
schools we
also all recognize how hard it may be to
keep children six feet apart at all
times
so i've talked to many families and many
teachers about doing your best
recognizing that some distance is better
than no distance and six feet is optimal
but it's not always going to be
achievable
the third aspect of safe care and safe
education
is hand hygiene and so this is something
we've all been hearing a lot about
washing our hands using hand sanitizer
this is something that should happen on
a regular schedule in schools it should
be made fun
and kids can be engaged in this type of
activity and be part of that
and then the fourth most important
factor is cleaning surfaces
and sometimes we place a lot of emphasis
on cleaning surfaces as if it's the most
important factor and it's important
but the good news is that covet is not
very hardy
it dies when it dries and it dies in the
sunlight
and so we don't need extensive
over-the-top
elaborate cleaning processes we need our
usual routine cleaning processes we need
to wipe down
high touch surfaces and and we need to
really focus on hand hygiene because if
our hands are clean
then we're all really protected another
important factor
is ventilation and there have been a
number of studies that demonstrate that
areas that are better ventilated
uh have lower risk of disease
transmission we know that schools vary
in their ability to provide different
degrees of ventilation
but at any time that a teacher can open
a window can take a class
outside when it's appropriate at the
discretion of the teacher
those are activities that will help as
well
and those i think you said at the
beginning
those are cumulative do all of them is
that the
cumulative they're accumulative but
they're in order of importance so the
masking is the most important
followed by distancing followed by hand
hygiene followed by surface cleaning
but together they create a very robust
package for safety
and i want to also echo what you said
earlier and that is that
um you know what we do in our community
will impact our schools we are all
connected
we are all in this together and so what
happens in our communities will impact
our schools and what happens in our
schools
will be reflected in our community uh if
we want children to do these things
we want children to wear masks we have
to wear masks we have to model that
behavior for them as
the adults and the parents in their
lives uh and so it's really
all for one in this type of uh climate
that we're in
doctor what if you could you know talk a
little bit
uh about uh kind of the stress i mean
this has been a stressful time for
adults stressful time
for kids kids are going to be starting
back in school
some of the protocols that they're going
to have to follow will be different
some kids will be wearing masks maybe
for the maybe for the first time
um any advice for parents any advice for
teachers as we
we kind of start back in this uh great
unknown or
something at least different for us
exactly one one piece of advice i've
given a lot of families including just
this morning when i was in clinic
is to uh let children know that it's
okay
to be uncertain there's a lot of
uncertainty we've been dealing with a
tremendous amount of uncertainty
and sometimes children look to us for
recognition and approval of that
uncertainty yes we know it's different
we know that things have changed and
that's okay
but we're going to learn together as we
go so parents talking to their children
and giving them
some some warning and some heads up
about what may be coming
doing a little bit of rehearsal around
mask wearing about
hand hygiene um we talk a lot in my
field about using stories and social
stories to kind of illustrate here's
what's going to happen here's what it
might look like
most children and most people really
benefit from structure so preparing
children who may have not had a lot of
structure over the past several months
preparing them for the uh the restart of
some structure of sleep schedules wake
schedules
i've i talked about that literally all
morning with families about the
importance of getting back onto a
schedule
and how much schedules and
predictability help everybody
uh and so i think there are a lot of
basic things that families and teachers
can do
starting with just talking to children
and trusting that they're actually going
to understand and be able to comply
dr manny thank you very much very very
helpful i wonder if you could
stay with us a little bit we may have
some questions from the
from the news media but thank you for
those good good instructions and those
those good tips we appreciate it very
very much
let me now welcome our third
doctor dr adam misoff chief medical
officer at dayton children's hospital
uh doctor thank you very very much for
being with us
i know that you've been working with
physicians at dayton children's to
develop a protocol for how schools
respond
if and when covet appears in their
schools
so first of all thanks for joining us
but i wonder if you could kind of
maybe run through some examples of
how schools should react
kind of maybe a a drill so to speak
you've got this circumstance and this
circumstance and then how does how does
the school
react to that so thanks for joining us
uh thank you governor it's a pleasure
and i'd like to echo the comments of my
colleagues they're very important
that the best things we can do uh start
at home
in showing our kids uh how this how this
can be and how predictable we can make
it
so i appreciate the question uh we have
some slides that i'd like to show you
uh we have been working uh closely with
the school systems with the health
department
and with our primary care doctors to try
and help develop
a path forward if you will an
evidence-based guide
an algorithm a way for people to start
thinking about how to manage
these problems as they arise because we
know that
as school starts up there'll be a lot of
questions a lot of concerns a lot of
things that may change
this slide is part of our algorithm and
so my intention is not to walk through
this
in great detail but just to highlight a
few things for you the first is if you
look at the top left corner
the box is where people start which is
or have you been exposed to somebody
with covet
and if the answer is yes it goes across
the screen
and asks the question and patty referred
to this
that were you within six feet and there
for longer than 15 minutes the cdc
defines that
as a significant exposure and if so
we know the standard approach the
protocols to this
the challenge often comes with symptoms
that aren't as
clear so this algorithm if you will
walks through what may be considered
high-risk symptoms low-risk symptoms
and one of the points i wanted to make
was that
not all the illnesses we will see this
fall are coveted
but having said that one of the messages
we've given to our hospital staff and i
would give to the schools is
if you're sick stay home it doesn't have
to be coveted
so whether it's a staff person or a a
a student if you have a fever and you're
sick
first and foremost please stay home that
will help protect
others in your school and other families
so that will be part of this protocol so
to address your question perhaps the
next slide
we've come up with go ahead sir i'm
sorry doctor let me interrupt eric
are the slides up okay they're up i'm
not seeing them but
they're up okay as long as the people
who are watching this can see them okay
go ahead i apologize yes sir um so we
have more than a dozen scenarios and i
have
three that are incorporated in this uh
sly deck
and and this is to help folks sort of
walk through and understand
how this algorithm can help them and how
they can approach
uh students faculty and others as
the fall evolves so in a scenario one a
child's riding the school bus monday
through friday
not wearing an ask all the time but only
on the bus for 10 minutes
feels ill over the weekend and then
comes up
positive for covet and the two main
concerns are
who needs to be isolated and who perhaps
needs to be evaluated
and so if you go to the next slide with
these scenarios that we're sending
and sharing with the schools in our
regions and we're going to
talk as a group at ohio children's
hospital we walk
through how you would answer this so who
is isolated
bus driver no in this case the student
was in the back of the bus and not near
them
and again foundationally because they
are not within six feet for 15 minutes
therefore they don't need to be isolated
again if the students were around them
for less than
15 minutes and less and more than six
feet
then there is no need for isolation but
i would point out that we assume when a
family member is positive
whether you have a positive test on
other family members that we treat
the whole family as if that's a
significant exposure and they are
positive
and we know that testing can be a
challenge so we're trying to be
good stewards of that resource so who
should be evaluated by a provider who
may need testing
again the second piece of the scenarios
that we have constructed have to do with
if you walk through each member of this
scenario
who needs what and in general if you
have no symptoms
and you didn't have a significant
exposure then just
watching and making sure you're okay is
sufficient
the next slide is a second scenario
again this is now in the classroom it is
closer to six feet
the student developed symptoms and again
i'll remind you that
um within six feet and for more than 15
minutes
is considered a significant exposure
different people
will use different definitions of
sufficient
uh personal protective equipment but
without getting off on that tangent if
we go to the next slide
we again answer those kinds of questions
so who should be isolated yes
classmates and teachers if they were
again within that
distance and for the time frame that
we've described
and in general without symptoms it's
okay
to watch but if there's any concern
about the symptoms that are developing
we are partnering with our primary care
doctors to make sure that they have the
information they need uh to help manage
these patients
so yes all of these folks would be
isolated because they were
in that 6 foot 15 minute mark
and depending on their symptoms depends
on who
would move forward with more uh of a
health care evaluation
the final scenario we're going to talk a
little bit again about what has
come up before which is how does this
work as far as sports are concerned
uh once again there are basic tenants
that we're going to the student
participates in volleyball
they have face coverings at the
beginning at the end of practice
but certainly not during practice if
they're closer to six feet
and that teammate does end up with
symptoms
and a test is positive how do you handle
this
so again the questions are who should be
isolated
and who may need further evaluation if
you go to the next slide
the the team that was close to this
person
would need to be evaluated since that
test is positive another one of the
take-home messages though
is that if you are in contact
with a contact of somebody red cove so
it's a
it's once removed that person does not
count as somebody who has been actively
exposed to the infection
i'm happy to walk through the answers to
this governor but in the interest of
time
i'm happy to turn it over to you and see
if there's specific questions these were
meant to be just though
examples of the scenarios we're trying
to construct
to help people walk through an
appropriate way of
handling the problems that are going to
arise as schools return
doctor you want to comment a little bit
and thank you that was very helpful
about different scenarios based on
whether you're outside
or inside how much that impacts that
and i think what may be a little
confusing
is a little bit to me whenever i hear it
is because the the
standard of how long you're with a
person
and how that how that plays out
and what the other variables that might
be
you might look at to determine whether
or not that person you
you think there's a there's a problem
connected to that person and sports is a
sports is a great example
you know contact sports uh you know
whether whatever you call volleyball but
uh you know if you're
close to the net uh with somebody on the
other side maybe you have some contact
with them
um so you wanna just go through the
different variables
yes sir i'm happy to um first and
foremost
and i know patty mentioned this when she
talked about ventilation there's no
greater ventilation than being outside
so how how much breeze
gets to pull droplets away from people
anything we can do outside would be
great and and patty is in the past
talked about even if you can get a
classroom outside
that natural outside ventilation is
always
uh very helpful well
you may have seen the picture i saw them
i don't know a month or so ago there's
some articles about the 1918
1919 and they had classes actually
outside
in some places yes and i've been accused
of being in some of those classrooms but
i am not that
in addition um part of the challenges
is is is being able to determine
um the contact level if you will and so
we've had questions that arise about
intermittent
contact is it cumulative or consecutive
is the contact for 15 straight minutes
or if
i'm in contact with somebody five
minutes every hour
five times and i must tell you there is
no
hard and fast evidence on the exact
path to take so we again are trying to
make a judgment
based if you will on the intensity of
the exposure
and that's where one of the things that
we're all working on
is a hotline where people can call and
we can help them sort through that
uh when that arises so
general principles but the science gets
a little
iffy if you're trying to compare for
example if five five and five or
15 straight yes sir and i'd be happy to
have my other colleagues
uh weigh in but my understanding and all
that we've read is
it's very hard to discern one versus the
other
okay good well doctor thank you very
much if you could
stay with us as well yes sir we're going
to now go
to lieutenant governor for some state
comments and
then we're going to go to questions and
if we can hold the three doctors
here in case there's some questions for
them lieutenant governor
thanks governor i was making some notes
as the doctors were talking all three of
them did
a fantastic job of explaining
the situation uh uh that they
that they all uh the such the the
different situations they were all
describing i know that when i from the
time i wake up in the morning
uh to the time i go to bed at night i'm
consuming information on these topics uh
particularly a lot of that related to
school
and and i thought they all did a great
job of explaining
uh because we know that every family or
every superintendent who's making a
decision
is is just struggling with getting all
the health data
right thinking about all of their
academic options
family circumstances we know how those
things are difficult
choices as it relates to work and health
and mental health and
and trying to make the the best choices
for your children so
all of this information that we get
helps uh
and it's important to remember that
we're all consuming this during a very
difficult time
it's hard on the school officials and
the teachers that are contemplating
their future
the families that are contemplating
their particular futures i know we're
all in a little bit different
circumstances
in in my case my wife and i are
comfortable with our daughters uh headed
back heading back to school
this fall but we know that there are
many families and many circumstances
where that may not work out
uh and may not be the best thing
for those for those families and we know
uh
how was because we talked to them we
talked to all the folks who are doing
this the governor and i do and
we know how people are struggling uh
and you know that's why you know nobody
knows how this is going to go
nobody knows exactly if you're in school
if you're not in school how this is
going to work
for the fall that's why i just want to
remind people that the governor has
given
ohio a choice in this
what he's asked is to say that the local
schools are going to make the best
decision based on their community
standards families get to make the
decisions
based on their circumstances and i think
we're going to learn
a lot from that we will we will learn uh
from that process which will inform
next steps uh as schools families and
parents continue to learn
but i will say there is something that
we do know
we know how to slow the spread of the
virus
and whether you're in school or outside
of school
you do these things right and we'll make
it more likely that all of this gets to
happen in our futures because we will
slow the spread of the virus
and um as we as we often say
back up mask up and wash up
those are the things that work uh and if
we do them
we're gonna get a chance to to do more
things because we will have slowed the
spread so
i really appreciate the doctor's uh
advice there and council and
and governor thanks for giving me a few
minutes to to share
share some thoughts and and i know that
that families and schools alike are
struggling with these decisions and so
we all have to be
we have to be patient and
and and caring and understanding as we
all work through this
thank you very much we're ready for
questions
we still have the doctors if anyone has
a question for
one or all of the doctors or if you have
a question for the lieutenant governor
or for myself
governor our first question today at
wbns 10 tv in columbus
hello governor can you hear me
well we're getting a little echo there
but i can't hear you yeah
i think can you hear me yes
okay great uh franklin county remains in
the red and it's been there since the
beginning of the health advisory
what are you hearing at the as to why
that is and if it stays in red do you
think that will prevent
high school football from happening and
to the doctors
how do you feel about children
riding the school bus if you had
children in school
would you feel comfortable with them
riding in a school bus
to and from school considering the
social distancing concerns
doc doctors all start i'll do the
franklin county one you guys can do the
uh
the the bus one
look i mean i can only speculate uh a
better person to ask that would be you
know
one of the health directors or medical
doctor as far as franklin county
uh mayor ginther and i have talked about
this a lot
uh and you know if you look at columbus
itself
uh it probably is the youngest uh
community and franklin county probably
is the youngest county as far as
population
i don't have the data but um it's it's
it's a younger group of people
uh and one of the things that we have
seen uh is that particularly with 20 to
29 year olds
you know they're picking it up at a much
heavier rate than they were
and i think visually you can just see
that they're out and about a lot
that's understandable so the fact that
franklin county has more
young people is probably a great
advantage for the county
but it probably also is a reason that
you're seeing the spread
you know continue here in franklin
county
continued there in franklin county
let me go to let me go to the doctors
and we'll talk they can
take the question about riding a school
bus
i think i'm gonna i'm gonna take the
school bus questions so i i think it's
always fair to say hey would you let
your children do this
and my answer to that question is yes i
would i understand that bus riding feels
different it feels more constrained it
feels like children are in very close
contact which they are
but the good news is children are facing
forward if they're behaving on the bus
they're facing forward
if they're wearing masks if they are not
sick
if they practice hygiene before and
after being on the bus
uh then i think children can ride the
bus safely and i think that
the bus you know riding the bus to
school is the only way that some
children get to school
and i would hate to limit access to
in-person school because of some kind of
transportation constraint
so i think we can make bus travel safe
for children and i think um i think that
i would support that yes
okay any other doctors
okay we'll go the next question next
question
is from jeff redick at wsyx in columbus
hi governor thanks for running this
again
uh for the doctors i believe it was last
week
or a week and a half ago when the
state's mass order was issued
for uh schools and students k-12
specifically
it was mentioned that the ohio
children's hospital association
said that asthma allergies or sinus
infections would not be considered
exemptions from wearing a mask and i
know those conditions specifically
become touch points for parents with
children who have asthma allergies sinus
infections regularly
why won't those get you out of wearing a
mask if you're k through 12.
and let me just jump in before they
answer ultimately
you know these determinations are going
to be made by the principal they're
going to be made by the by the teachers
uh what the doctors offered and what the
american pediatrics association the ohio
chapter offered
was the best medical advice they could
give so let me turn it to the doctors
for that
governor i'd be happy to try and answer
that and
and what i can tell you is when that
document was constructed
we asked for help from a lot of experts
and one of the groups we asked for help
was
was our pulmonologists and our
pulmonologists are our lung doctors and
those are the doctors that manage these
patients
and they were very clear that most
patients with those disorders
a mask would not interfere with their
ability to breathe or their ability to
function well
and they felt that the importance of
masks protecting those
patients from getting an infection in
their lungs far
exceeded any risk that there was in
wearing them so
there was a lot of thought it's a very
good question there was a lot of thought
put into that
but we actually reached out to experts
who take care of these patients and they
felt strongly that
these kids needed the protection of a
mask
okay next question next
question is from andy chow at ohio
public radio and television
hi governor thanks for having this press
conference i wanted to talk about
uh the definition of close contact being
within six feet
for longer than 10 to 15 minutes what
we've seen in other states that
a lot of controversy starts to pop up
when pictures of crowded
hallways start to circulate are crowded
hallways
dangerous at schools i'm going to refer
to the doctors
so who wants to take it
i can take that question so um i'd say
quickly yes
crowded hallways are probably not
optimal for a lot of reasons not just
coven
um it gets again back to the length of
time in that hallway and so
um if you remember back to your own high
school days it was unusual
to be traveling in a crowded hallway for
more than 10 minutes
uh so i think that's an an aspect of
duration that we have to consider
i mean ideally schedules would be
staggered in a way so that kids weren't
crammed up next to each other
um so the short answer is yeah they're
not optimal they're not great but they
shouldn't be prohibitive to
school uh participation and they should
be managed we can manage those better
and if i may say that a crowded hallway
with the mask it's a different
calculation than a crowded hallway
without mass so back to dr manning's
assertion earlier that mask or priority
number
are number one okay thank you very much
next question next question is from
scott hallis of the xenia daily gazette
hey governor how you doing scott uh
thanks for
taking my question so the doctors have
all said that
you know being outside and having good
ventilation is an important thing
and that there's no way to kind of
discern whether five minutes of contact
three times is better or worse than you
know 15 minutes
at once the ohio high school football
coaches association
sent you a pretty comprehensive plan as
far as how they plan to cleanse things
and how they plan to try and keep things
safe if there's a season
so how much of this information the
doctors have said today
regarding you know ventilation
everything is going to help sway your
decision one way or another with regards
to
uh football this fall well i'll start
off and i'm gonna refer to see if any of
the doctors want to make any comment
uh about that um you know scott
these decisions are not made in a vacuum
and by that i mean
um it's not a question does the does
that young person play football does
that person play
uh playing the band does that person do
whatever they're doing
part of the question is what do they do
if they're not doing that
um and so i think one of the arguments
for sports
uh is it does have a discipline to it
uh and you know we're still working on
the orders in regards to sports we'll
have that shortly it won't be too much
longer
you know we've basically taken sports
and
let it play out during during the during
the fall
but the final decisions that will be
coming very very shortly but
part of the argument for sports
that is i think a strong one is first of
all there's a discipline to sports
part of that discipline this year will
have to be different than the normal
discipline part of the discipline this
year will have to be being safe
and i think our coaches those who are
assisting
those who are working with our young
people whether in sports or whether
in drama or whatever they're in um
they're they are role models and
what's not only it's not only important
what these
young people do in school what they do
in practice whatever that
is they're practicing but what they do
the other rest of the day
and so our coaches our teachers have a
great opportunity
to help these young people understand
that the choices they make at nine
o'clock at night
or 10 o'clock at night or some other
time on the weekend when they're not
practicing or they're not
you know with the coach that those life
choices
that they're going to make this year
they're always important but this year
they're more important than they've ever
been before
and that the choices they make may
determine whether or not their team is
going to be able to continue to play
that sport
and so everybody literally on that team
is in it together
and if one gets sick maybe many will get
sick and so
staying away from situations where you
may get sick
or at least doing the best you can
wearing that mask
you know when you're out and keeping the
social distance and doing the other
things that
that we we have been talking about here
coaches have a great ability to
get that message across in a way
sometimes that
even parents don't have a way of doing
that so i'm going to turn it to the
doctors and see what comments they have
but that's my
kind of some comments that i would have
in regard to this whole
whole decision that parents will make
that schools will make
and what kind of guidance that we're
we're going to put out
i don't know if any of our doctors have
any comments in regards i actually
i don't think there's much to add
governor i think you covered it very
well
and you really emphasize this point that
we're trying to hit hard which is that
what we do outside of school affects
what we can do in school
um it's clear that there's going to be a
lot more discussion around sports and
that those decisions
and i think we just have to wait on
those discussions
anybody else okay
next question our next question is uh
from marty schleyden at the ohio capitol
journal
good afternoon governor um i wanted to
switch over to the economy
uh quickly uh yesterday yeah
your administration announced it was
going to try to
um put out work with the trump
administration on a 300
a month federal unemployment supplement
would it be
easier administratively and quicker just
to continue
the 600 supplement that was in place
until the end of the month
and also one of the sticking points
between congressional democrats and the
trump administration is 900 billion
dollars
for state and local governments uh where
would you come down on that argument
well first of all i am the eternal
optimist
i spent 20 years in congress i've seen
hopeless cases where no one thought
there could be a deal and there was a
deal
i saw it time after time after time so
i'm an optimist
i think there's a deal to be had between
the house and the senate uh in the
administration and i
you know urge congress to to get about
the job of of getting that done i think
they can
second i think what the president did
was the right thing
uh president was looking at a stalemate
uh he wanted to move the ball maybe push
uh get some people to negotiate more but
also try to do something that was be a
positive thing
uh and so the three hundred dollars that
he's talking about we have people in
ohio who
really need that money and we want to
get that if that's where we end up but
that's what
the final thing is from the
administration uh then we want to get
that money out
to people as fast as we can
as far as ohio adding to that you talked
about 600
we don't have the ability to do that um
you know we're looking in an economy uh
that while we're optimistic about it
while it's coming back our unemployment
has gone down
we hope it will continue to go down but
we also know
that we are facing the covet we're still
fighting
the covid we know what impact that has
on the economy
and so you know there's no money in the
unemployment fund
to do this um you know we would have to
take the money from
someplace else um we're looking
at keeping money set aside for
testing and things that we absolutely
have to do to keep people safe
so that our not only do we keep people
safe so that our economy can continue to
to move to move forward so um
number one i hope uh to recap congress
needs to get
this done and they need to get to get it
out and and get the whole
the whole package done to i think the
trump administration i thank them for
doing this
uh they have indicated uh to us that
uh we could take this three hundred
dollars and get this money out and
that's what we intend to do we're
awaiting instructions
specifically about how how that how that
would work
so thank you our next question is from
adrian robbins
at wcmh in columbus
hi governor thank you for doing this
again um a new
cdc analysis showed that black children
and hispanic children were far more
likely to be hospitalized if
they do contract cover 19 than white
children
are you concerned with the tools sending
children back to school
could take on the minority communities
that have already suffered
disproportionately during this pandemic
yes i'm going to refer to the doctors
for any
uh in regard to
our african-american young people or
hispanic young people
and you know the doctors cited and you
cited
the large number of uh young people who
end up in the hospital much more
likely to end up in a hospital and it's
the same way with adults
um so it's just tragic it's very very
tragic let me see if any of the doctors
want to make a comment
just just just a couple of comments um
true what we see in ohio is seen
nationally underrepresented minorities
are much more likely to test positive
and they're much more likely to bear the
burden of the
complications in the disease including
hospitalizations and maybe even
icu stays so it is something to be very
concerned about as
schools open and i do think this is the
governor's strategy in allowing schools
to make local
decisions based on their their um
local conditions the the challenges are
under representing minority patients is
is um is how often
uh multi-family living situations
or um use of public transportation
uh frequently essential worker
status and so it's just a real it's just
a real
challenge and an unfortunate dimension
to this pandemic
you know we continue to have disparities
in health
based on race and there's absolutely no
doubt about that
we're going to be talking about this
sometime the next week
in in in more detail dr acton and i
and and the lieutenant governor talked
about this on several different
occasions we had other doctors who came
in and who talked about it so it is one
of the tragedies
that we live with uh and we all have an
obligation a moral obligation
uh to change that and and so we're gonna
continue to work with the state
legislature to do everything that we can
in this area and we'll have
more to say about this uh probably later
this later this week
but it's a great tragedy and i am
concerned
and governor if i might if i might say
this is
also the same demographic that will have
challenges with access to web services
and virtual school
as well so it's just a real catch-22
it is it is absolutely
next question governor your next
question is from
jackie borchert at the cincinnati
inquirer
uh good afternoon governor uh thanks for
making the doctors available to us today
we've heard from many people who have
waited a week or more to get their
coronavirus test results
public health officials say that
anything past about two days is not
helpful as far as tracing
and stopping additional transmission um
your pcr test came back the same day uh
what is your plan for making that kind
of testing turnaround available to all
ohioans yeah look i i work on this every
day my team works on this every day
we're not unique other states have have
this problem that doesn't mean that
it's not a problem it is a big big
problem and you're right the longer
it goes before you get the data comes
back then the less the tracing
and the contact tracing value that it
has
and so when you're five days six days
seven days that's just
not where we want to be uh
at all uh so we're doing a number of
things
uh in in regard to
getting more testing where we've seen
some of the long lags for a couple a
couple things going on just i just mean
two of them uh once once some of the
testing that's being done in ohio is
going to national
labs it's not us but you know we
welcome all the testing but some of us
going to national labs and they're
they're behind quest for example is
behind they know they're behind
they're doing everything they can to
close close that gap
some of the other national labs have
started to close the gap and are
doing a much much better job in addition
to that we have some of our hospitals
who
are frankly being strangled because they
can't get enough reagent
the reagent is being allocated to states
that are hotter than ohio
um you know one of the good things and
but also it has a disadvantage
uh never have we been a really really on
fire state
uh you know we never were new york uh we
never were texas in california in
different
other states at different periods of
time uh we've always been
it while we're much we're certainly
higher than we want to be
um you know we're not near what the
positivity rate
uh you know we're at 5.2 or something uh
and
you saw on the map we got some states
that are much higher so
many times that gets directed uh to
those states
that are hotter than we are which
lessens the amount of
uh the reagent that or whatever the
product is that is going to some some of
our hospitals so
we watch these numbers and we're going
to continue to try to expand our testing
and the more options we have for testing
the more opportunity we're going to see
get that back
we're talking with the company right now
in regard to doing some trials and if
those trials work
this is saliva if that trials work for
that we might be able to expand that
uh rather dramatically in in ohio so
uh it's a problem we know it's a problem
and
we've been doing everything we can to
cut the time down
and to get more testing next question
our next question is from max philby at
the columbus dispatch
hi governor um your administration has
uh
every week released information
including the number of
new cases and deaths at uh long-term
care facilities
and i'm wondering if that's something
you're considering requiring school
districts to do and why or
why not that might be well that's an
excellent question
um it's an excellent question uh we will
we will look at that
and get get back to you um
you know i i think generally more
information is better
you know it enables parents to make
decisions
you know particularly in the small
school districts which i have more
experience with
as a parent you know you know what's
going on pretty much in the district
you know if you know there's a problem
in third grade there's a problem in
seventh grade or something like that in
the bigger districts i understand
that information may not flow as easily
out
or automatically so that's something we
will we will look at
and that's something that we would hope
would come really
from the schools but we'll look to see
if there needs to be any kind of
regulations
in regard to that but schools have an
obligation
to keep parents informed about how
everything is going whether they're
remote whether in
uh in person and part of how things are
going obviously has to do with
you know if they're if they're cases and
kids who are
out of school and who've been diagnosed
with with covenant obviously you have to
protect
individual rights and individual
privacy but
looking at it from the big picture and
knowing what's going on these schools is
important
our next question is from jim province
of the toledo blade
hello governor i wanted to get your
reaction to the word that the big ten is
postponing its fall
sports season until at least spring and
would you expect that uh
more will follow
well well as as as a football fan and
we have a lot of them uh in ohio and a
lot of buckeye fans that certainly is
not
is not good news um ultimately
this is a decision that has to be made
by the schools
uh they weigh many things and i'm sure
they start off with the safety of
of their players uh but they're the way
other other factors is
as well so i think it's
a disappointment for
buckeye nation um
importantly it's disappointment for the
young men who play football
uh and who are on ohio state and who
you know whatever year it is uh so
i talked uh this morning with
gene smith and
you know i know they're they they were
looking at maybe doing it in this in the
spring and seeing how things
go in the spring uh those pose that
poses
more challenges so look
as a fan i'm disappointed uh but this is
a decision that was made by the big ten
this is made by the schools and
you know we have to respect that
that decision
our next question is from molly kowig at
whio in dayton
hi governor with the big ten's decision
has that heightened your concerns about
high school athletes
and will the big tens move influence
your decision moving forward when it
comes
to high school athletes and athletes at
other levels
well no no decision is ever made in a
vacuum and all
information is important uh that you get
so
you know i'm certainly i'm sure that you
know there's discussion uh right now
going on uh people are having about that
issue
what i said before i will say again
because i think it's at least for me uh
and for lieutenant governor as we look
at this
uh and we talk to you know we talk to a
lot of people
uh in regard to these decisions about
high school sports
but they are decisions that cannot be
made in a vacuum
it's not a question of are they going to
play football
or not play football are they going to
have wrestling or not wrestling or
whatever the sport might be
volleyball sport our family is a lot
more familiar with which would be cross
country
you know but the basic facts don't
change because of what the
big ten has decided to do
but what i said before again i will say
because i think it's important you can't
make these decisions in a vacuum
parents can't schools can't our
administration
can't i think you have to look at what
are the things that that student would
be doing
uh what discipline can be gained by
being in a sport
and that's one of the things that we
usually associate with
sports there's a discipline
self-discipline
discipline for the team
and part of that discipline this year uh
you know for teams that play
is going to be let's let's have a season
let's have a full season
and what we do not just on the playing
field or in the practice field but what
we do
as as a team members uh in our spare
time
and when we're home and other players
when we're out
is going to determine um you know what
chance we have to have that that
particular season
so uh look it's it goes it goes into the
mix it's
part of what people are certainly
talking about and uh
that's about all i have to say at this
point anyway
thank you governor your next question is
from
noah blundo at hannah news service
hello good afternoon governor uh my
question i believe is for the doctors
i'm wondering
how much information they feel that
they've
had access to in their studies of this
that's
focuses directly on the possible thread
of course in
in environments that are akin to school
because
students haven't been in school up to
this point and they've been maybe even
more isolated as a group than adults
because
they don't have jobs to go to and such
so
you know how much experiences they're
out there to
look at when you're evaluating the risks
directly on point to having students in
an environment like school
who wants to take that at that
that's a great question we don't because
we haven't had school in place during
the
you know the bulk of the time we've been
living with covent we don't have a lot
to go off of direct experience but we do
have some camp stories and there's a
story of a camp in georgia published
recently
that went through a very detailed
contact tracing report of what happened
when one camper
came down with covid and you know i
think what we learned
from that story very at a very high
level is that you know children who are
in close quarters these are children who
are
um many of whom are overnight campers
those who are at higher risk
uh it wasn't clear how rigorous the
masking protocol was
um so we learned from that one large
story that that
children are at risk and that children
who are participating in
activities where they're in close
contact and not practicing those four
practices that we talked about um with
with
vigilance and rigor that a lot of
individuals will get sick very quickly
and but that's all we have to go off of
we don't have a lot of other
large volume large grouping of children
experiences so
you know moving forward with school
there's a lot of uncertainty about how
this is going to go
and i think a lot about our early days
as children's hospital
uh children's hospitals leaders and and
children's hospitals in general and
hospitals in general dealing with covid
we learned a lot
in the first few days and weeks and
months in terms of our own dealing with
coping
and our schools are going to do the same
and we'll have to support them as they
learn and maybe pivot and shift and make
different decisions than they started
with as they learn
i think that's the best that we can hope
for thanks doctor
anybody else patty i'd also like to add
that
and first of all patty is spot on with
her response
schools have opened in other countries
and so there are also lessons we've
learned from
some of the things that have hurt some
have done it successfully some of it not
as successfully
i think you get back to what dr manning
has stressed
you have to do it but you got to do it
right and it depends on the community's
effort
to keep the infection at bay
not just what the school is doing
actually i'll just chime in adam that's
thank you for the reminder because
uh there was an excellent report from
israel about a school that opened and
many high school students um came down
very quickly with covett and
uh in reading that study that report it
was very interesting how
many things that they chose to do in the
moment because of a heat wave
how that really hurt their efforts
closing the windows taking off masks
worsening ventilation uh it was like a a
recipe
for cobit and so we learned from that
not to do that
dr manning you want to you want to give
the uh
your five things again quickly because
that's that's the summary so
and i really have to thank our
infectious disease colleagues who've led
the way on this
on this learning but four things in
order of importance plus
number five the first one is masking the
second one is distancing
the third one is hand hygiene the fourth
is cleaning surfaces
and then when you can do some work
around ventilation in addition to all of
those
you're going to have a very good robust
package of safety for your students
thank you let me just add we're also you
know
monitoring what's going on in indiana
indiana starts school in some places
significantly earlier than we do we also
have real staggered
openings of schools so we're going to be
seeing schools opening fairly
fairly soon and we're going to be seeing
what happens in in those schools
so we're going to monitor this very very
very closely
next question governor this is the last
question today and it will be from uh
tom
galek at gongwer news service hi
governor
we're hearing anecdotally and then
seeing some reports from
teachers unions that a significant
number of teachers might either seek
some kind of medical accommodation
retire or leave the profession are you
worried about the ability of school
districts that return
in person to be able to staff classrooms
at a safe level
uh that's certainly a possibility it's
also you know a possibility once school
starts
that we get teachers who get sick
and so yes absolutely um you know our
belief is that
the superintendents the school boards
people at the local level
can best gauge that and make that
decision but
look this is as as dr manning said uh
there's no real playbook for this
uh we've not had anything like this in
our country uh
you know since 1980 we've seen what's
happened in some other
countries uh we've learned some things
but
you know we're just going to have to see
but sure it's it's absolutely something
to worry about
and look one of the things that we we've
talked about before
is the importance for every school to
try to identify
the students but also particularly
you know their adults whether custodian
or their teacher
whether they work work in the kitchen
wherever who might have some
medical reason to be particularly
vulnerable
and so you know we have to continue to
focus on
on those individuals and as as i've
talked to superintendents
many times they have told me we have
separated them out
you know this teacher will teach
remotely because he or she
has this medical problem uh so i would
just
ask uh all our people in all our schools
to continue to watch out for each other
and to watch out for the people who are
the most vulnerable um
and we know who that we know we know who
those are
thank you that was the last question
uh i'd like to show as we and thank you
the three doctors thank you very very
much we learned a lot from you today and
thank you we're very very grateful for
you being with us
let me show as we uh wrap up a short
video that our bureau of workers
compensation video group
put together for going back to school it
is quick
it is fun and it's a reminder of the
critical things that our students
and school staff do so that everyone can
have the safest
back to school humanly possible and
again
this is what our teachers do every day
this is what our
administrators do whether the covet is
out there or not
they work to protect our kids
it's back to school time and time for
ohio students
to rise up just remember
back up mask up wash up
back up try to stay six feet away from
others
at the bus at lunch when playing
and especially indoors
mask up covering your nose and mouth
with a face covering
helps prevent germs from getting on
people close by
wash up wash your hands often and for
about 20 seconds
you did it see school's gonna be a
breeze
just remember back backup mask up
wash up
well mask on and thank you all very very
much we look forward to seeing you
