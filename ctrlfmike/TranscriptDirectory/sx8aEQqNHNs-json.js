    "2015 new cases in ohio it was not long",

    "excuse me it was not long ago that we",
    "were a thousand cases a day and",
    "and trending downward as we can see from",
    "our 21",
    "day trend chart our numbers continue to",
    "rise at a rate that should concern",
    "all of us we have 216 new",
    "hospitalizations reported in the past",
    "24 hours it's the highest number of",
    "hospitalizations we've ever reported",
    "and there's over 50 hospitalizations",

    "pandemic tragically",
    "we've also have eight deaths reported",
    "since yesterday and 36 new",
    "icu admissions eric let's go to the",
    "top 88 counties here is the full list of",
    "all 88 counties",
    "by case rate per hundred thousand uh and",
    "as you will you will see",
    "some of the top numbers are just",
    "staggering",
    "uh those are four times what the cdc",
    "says is a high incidence rate uh",
    "so the viruses were just running rampant",
    "in some of these top",
    "top counties on this version of the",
    "chart we have shaded in blue",
    "all the counties that meet the cdc's",
    "definition of high incidence",
    "so if you look at that everything that",
    "is blue is high incidence",
    "as a reminder high incident counties are",
    "ones with a case rate of more than 100",
    "cases per 100 000 population in the past",
    "two weeks",
    "currently 69 of our 88 counties",

    "counties",
    "as always these slides we posted to our",
    "coronavirus.ohio",
    "website if you would like to take a",
    "closer look at the list let's move to",
    "the top",
    "20. we have 20 counties with the highest",
    "case rate per 100",
    "000 population uh during the past",
    "couple of weeks again as we look at",
    "these with",
    "putting them at a at a rate that we've",
    "never seen before",
    "all glaze we've never really seen any",
    "rate that high",
    "so up at putnam you're almost five times",
    "what the cdc",
    "incidence is uh and as we go down",
    "with these counties uh these are just",
    "literally shocking numbers and i think",
    "the thing that",
    "we just we have to remember uh is that",
    "these numbers will not change",
    "unless we change unless we do things",
    "we can change the numbers but",
    "automatically they will they will simply",
    "they will simply not not change",
    "let's take a look at the data from some",
    "of our nearby states",
    "and what we have done is kind of done a",
    "timeline",
    "you can see ohio has mapped out a little",
    "bit in here you can see our neighboring",
    "states you can also see",
    "illinois uh in in wisconsin",
    "and what we wanted to do is just look at",
    "these how they were",
    "this is october 4th october 11th",
    "october 18th uh as we look at these",
    "at these sundays we can see a rather",
    "dramatic",
    "change and what you're seeing is there",
    "is certainly a change",
    "all throughout the region and you can",
    "see how",
    "how this is changing",
    "these maps show the case rate per",
    "hundred thousand population by county",
    "over the past few weeks",
    "the counties in green and yellow have",
    "relatively low case rates while the",
    "counties in orange and red have higher",
    "case rates",
    "as we see for the past three weeks cases",
    "have been increased throughout the",
    "midwest",
    "three sundays ago we saw a lot of",
    "counties at a very high",
    "case level in wisconsin but the wet",
    "rest rest of the midwest does not",
    "look nearly so bad as we look at two",
    "sundays ago though we could see more",
    "counties move into the orange level",
    "and then trends continue into this past",
    "sunday",
    "while we do know that there's some",
    "spread from neighboring states",
    "there certainly is also significant",
    "spread among counties",
    "between counties as residents move",
    "move about but i just thought that was",
    "that was kind of interesting just to see",
    "how this is",
    "how this is is in fact moving",
    "we know that our small businesses have",
    "really been",
    "hurt uh throughout this pandemic",
    "many of them have closed uh many of them",
    "have just",
    "are hanging on uh and they've virtually",
    "all of them",
    "have been hurt in the next week or so",
    "we'll be announcing steps",
    "uh to try to help these businesses i",
    "want to",
    "announce today that the checks that we",
    "announced on august 20th",
    "we'll go back to august 20th where i",
    "asked the bureau of workers compensation",
    "board of directors to approve",
    "a second dividend for public and private",

    "as financial support during the ongoing",
    "pandemic",
    "we felt that bwc could do this and stay",

    "businesses",
    "needed this the board approved this",
    "request",
    "on september 25th those checks will be",

    "beginning i believe on friday",
    "the final dividend amount will be",

    "billion dollars 1.3 billion dollars that",
    "will be going out",
    "in checks starting on friday",
    "to businesses throughout the state of",
    "ohio",
    "distributions such as these are possible",

    "this week",
    "as they analyzed based on their data",
    "what was going on",
    "in every state our letter obviously",
    "pertains to ohio",
    "and i just want to want to quote",
    "something that they wrote in there",
    "because as i looked at last night it",
    "struck me as",
    "something that i thought i should share",
    "with all of you this is from",
    "the trump administration we continue to",
    "see community spread initiated by social",
    "friends and family gatherings",
    "people must remember that seemingly",
    "uninfected family members",
    "and friends may be infected and may not",
    "have symptoms",
    "exposure to those who don't have",
    "symptoms and that exposure to that",
    "asymptomatic spread can easily lead to",
    "spread as people unmask",
    "in private gatherings",
    "the task force that sent us this white",
    "house task force recommended that",
    "ohioans limit friend and family get",
    "togethers",
    "to prevent situations where the virus",
    "can rapidly spread and reach those most",
    "at risk of complications",
    "it's the same thing that i hear when i",
    "talk to",
    "county health commissioners uh around",
    "the state and when they tell me",
    "where we're seeing the spread and that",
    "is where we're really seeing most",
    "most of the spread",
    "we're all excited beginning of ohio",
    "state football",
    "season and it's a big",
    "10 starts back up uh brown's friends",
    "bagel fans",
    "just just a word a word of caution for",
    "all of us and that is as we",
    "get together to watch football just be",
    "careful",
    "you know if you're not in your direct",
    "family um",
    "and you're socializing uh you know",
    "keep a mask on and just just be careful",
    "um we feel that the teams",
    "uh for example the bengals and the",
    "browns are doing a good job",
    "in the 12 000 fans that they have uh in",
    "their stadium",
    "uh and we've seen them do a good job in",
    "the past",
    "what we're really concerned about is",
    "just all of us as we get together and",
    "watch it on tv",
    "so please please be careful",
    "i want to talk a little bit about",
    "the vaccine that will be will be coming",
    "we this week submit ohio's interim draft",
    "covet 19 vaccine plan to the centers",
    "for disease control and prevention this",
    "is a framework of how decisions will be",
    "made when we know more about the vaccine",
    "and will provide us a way forward as the",
    "next chapter",
    "of the pandemic unfolds this draft will",
    "be available to the public tomorrow",
    "on the cobia 19 website at",
    "coronavirus.ohio.gov",
    "if you want to take a look at that",
    "this week we'll also be taking another",
    "step in this fight against covet by",
    "launching a new registration tool for",
    "health care providers who would like",
    "to eventually administer the kova 19",
    "vaccine this proactive move allows us to",
    "better",
    "be prepared and respond quickly once a",
    "vaccine is available",
    "providers this would be health",
    "departments hospitals",
    "pharmacies nursing facilities",
    "these would all be people that in",
    "organizations that we would anticipate",
    "would be",
    "directly involved in the distribution",
    "the giving of shots",
    "when the vaccine is available they",
    "should all",
    "register when this goes up online",
    "this week also something that's",
    "going up online today that we are",
    "announcing that our long-term care",
    "facility dashboard is going live",
    "this dashboard part of the covet 19",
    "dashboard on coronavirus.ohio.gov",
    "is another tool to help ohioans keep",
    "informed",
    "nursing facilities were permitted to",
    "allow indoor visitation beginning",
    "october 12th and we hope",
    "that they have done that this tool",
    "breaks down the types of visitation",
    "facilities are allowing across the state",
    "so you'll be able to go",
    "online and check your county if you've",
    "got a",
    "loved one in a nursing home you can see",
    "what the status is of visitation with",
    "that nursing home so this is more",
    "transparency",
    "it's an effective we hope is an",
    "effective tool to to help you",
    "as we move move forward",
    "let me talk briefly uh about um a flu",
    "update",
    "um this fall we know we'll be fighting",
    "flu and covet both",
    "we know that someone can have both and",
    "that",
    "the experts tell us that certainly is",
    "something that we all want to",
    "avoid uh some symptoms of the flu and",
    "covet are similar",
    "uh and sometimes it may be hard to tell",
    "the difference between them based on",
    "symptoms alone",
    "some distinguishing symptoms of covid",
    "i'm told by the doctors include",
    "shortness of breath loss of taste or",
    "smell with flu however",
    "nasal congestion and runny nose are more",
    "common",
    "if you become ill this season many",
    "health care providers will test for both",
    "flu",
    "and coed to get a proper diagnosis",
    "further while the symptoms can be",
    "similar copay 19 is",
    "obviously more serious coping 19",
    "symptoms last longer those hospitalized",
    "tend to have longer hospital stays and",
    "the virus",
    "has a higher mortality rate i want to",
    "especially encourage",
    "our young people who may not be thinking",
    "about getting a flu shot",
    "to get one we know everyone should get",
    "one",
    "certainly the the elderly should get one",
    "uh",
    "uh very very young children uh",
    "should get one uh but sometimes uh those",
    "teenagers and those in in college years",
    "uh",
    "or maybe just out working at 22 23",
    "years of age sometimes think that they",
    "should not get one we would encourage",
    "them to get one",
    "as well you can get flu shot your",
    "doctor's office you can get a retail",
    "pharmacies",
    "urgent care clinic student health",
    "centers in addition many providers and",
    "local health departments are offering",
    "drive-through and curbside",
    "flu clinics for example recently perry",
    "county had a half day drive",
    "through drive through flu clinic they",
    "had 370 people",
    "almost as many as the 400 who were",
    "vaccinated in a full day",
    "in a full day in 2019 harrison county",
    "doubled the number of people vaccinated",
    "over last year",
    "at a recent drive-through clinic union",
    "county combined their typical",
    "city and county employee vaccination",
    "event with a drive-through clinic",
    "vaccinating more than 350 people in a",
    "day's time",
    "washington county tripled the number",
    "that they had had before",
    "so these are all encouraging encouraging",
    "things",
    "your health departments are going to be",
    "very aggressive you can obviously also",
    "get the",
    "flu shot at your doctor you can get it",
    "pharmacies and so we just",
    "encourage people to do that",
    "we talked earlier about sadly a",
    "record-setting day on days in regard to",
    "hospitalizations and so i thought it",
    "would be good",
    "uh to bring in someone who you've heard",
    "from before",
    "and someone who really",
    "is involved not just in what is going on",
    "in",
    "in columbus wexner medical center",
    "but he is directly involved in the",
    "system that we have set up",
    "statewide so we have divided the state",
    "early on this pandemic into three",
    "different zones",
    "and we some of the lead hospitals take",
    "the lead",
    "and work with the other hospitals and i",
    "know",
    "let me just introduce dr andy thomas",
    "dr thomas thanks for being back with us",
    "we we appreciate it very very much",
    "i know you and i were talking uh before",
    "we went on the air you're on the phone",
    "with um these smaller hospitals i know",
    "several times a week and you're on the",
    "you're on the phone",
    "a lot with the hospitals in your zone uh",
    "your particular zone as well so",
    "just tell us kind of what's going on",
    "with our hospitals we know we're seeing",
    "this hospitalization go up we don't like",
    "to see it but",
    "what's the status of our hospitals",
    "around the state",
    "uh thank you governor thanks to for",
    "having me here today",
    "uh so in terms of what we're seeing with",
    "hospital um a census for uh for covet",
    "patients we are certainly",
    "at the highest point that we've seen",
    "across the state at any time during the",
    "pandemic in terms of total",
    "hospitalizations",
    "uh here in zone 2 we are",
    "at our highest rates since back in early",
    "may",
    "zone 3 is actually at the highest rate",
    "that it's been at any time during the",
    "pandemic andy",
    "remind everybody what zone two is was",
    "where this",
    "the three zones are happy to zone one uh",
    "spreads",
    "uh from the northern uh west part of the",
    "state through",
    "uh cleveland youngstown akron canton",
    "area and bob wiley who's the chief",
    "clinical officer at cleveland clinic",
    "leads zone one",
    "zone two uh is regions four seven and",
    "eight",
    "region four spreads up 33 northwest of",
    "columbus",
    "down through what we would call the",
    "central ohio contiguous counties to",
    "franklin county",
    "then essentially everything 23 south 33",
    "south and 70 east at southeast quadrant",
    "of the state",
    "and then zone three are regions three",
    "and six which are essentially the dayton",
    "metropolitan area and everything to the",
    "west and then the cincinnati and",
    "southwestern",
    "part of the state rick lofgren from uc",
    "health",
    "is the lead for zone three so what we do",
    "as zone leads uh",
    "to your point uh governor two days a",
    "week i'm on the phone with local public",
    "health folks here in columbus as well as",
    "the",
    "lead clinicians for large group",
    "practices here in columbus and the",
    "columbus hospitals",
    "three days a week we're actually on a",
    "call for all of the hospitals in the",
    "zone that have coveted patients in the",
    "hospital",
    "once again talking about their capacity",
    "talking about the volume of patients",
    "making sure that we're coordinating",
    "things well around the zone",
    "in fact just yesterday at noon we stood",
    "back",
    "up our regional transfer center here for",
    "zone two so that any hospital in the",
    "zone that needs to move a patient to",
    "columbus",
    "either because they have too many",
    "coveted patients to manage",
    "in their hospital or a patient is too",
    "ill to be in their local community",
    "hospital and needs kind of a higher",
    "level of care",
    "any of those hospitals in the zone can",
    "call and essentially get a centralized",
    "call center",
    "so that we can make sure the patient is",
    "going to the right place at the right",
    "time",
    "to move between between hospitals also",
    "in terms of clinical",
    "updates two fridays ago we had 130",
    "infectious disease emergency department",
    "critical care and hospital medicine",
    "physicians plus pharmacists and nursing",
    "leaders",
    "from all the zone hospitals on the phone",
    "talking about the latest treatment",
    "protocols",
    "for covet 19. so we did that a number of",
    "times over the summer related to",
    "remdesseviere",
    "and this conversation uh covered both",
    "remdesvir as well as convalescent plasma",
    "steroids and a variety of other",
    "treatment protocols so the zone leads in",
    "zone one and zone three have similar",
    "cadence of uh meetings with the",
    "hospitals and providing that sort of",
    "support",
    "uh for physicians at the local level uh",
    "so that they don't feel like they're out",
    "at the end of a limb",
    "that's great so i interrupted you a few",
    "minutes ago",
    "i asked you to kind of define the zones",
    "uh",
    "go back and tell us again you know let's",
    "start with northeast north or",
    "northern tier of ohio uh what are we",
    "seeing in that",
    "in that zone what do we see in the other",
    "two zones sure well",
    "the numbers are up in in every zone",
    "compared to earlier",
    "uh in the summer certainly we all saw a",
    "peak in the spring and then another peak",
    "in",
    "in that late july early august uh time",
    "frame but zone three is the one",
    "that is actually at the highest point at",
    "all uh during the the pandemic and in",
    "zone",
    "uh one and two are certainly higher than",
    "we've been now for about two",
    "two and a half months so the total",
    "number is certainly higher than we've",
    "had at any time during the pandemic but",
    "i think what's really important",
    "is to talk about the distribution of",
    "those patients so regions seven and",
    "eight",
    "in my zone are the rural areas of the",
    "state where you have smaller hospitals",
    "in their local communities",
    "and actually part of our strategy is to",
    "make sure patients that may",
    "be you know ill enough to be in the",
    "hospital but not ill enough to need a",
    "high level of critical care or or",
    "high-end uh",
    "treatment that may not be available at",
    "those hospitals we want to try and keep",
    "as many patients locally as possible",
    "so those regions maybe saw 10 15 20",
    "patients in the past might be at 30 to",
    "50 patients now",
    "uh so we're doing our best to support",
    "those local hospitals there's excellent",
    "doctors nurses pharmacists working in",
    "those hospitals and if it",
    "if they are capable of taking care of",
    "patients we want them to stay as close",
    "to home as as possible",
    "but when you look at the distribution of",
    "where patients are coming from across",
    "the state that need admitted to the",
    "hospital it's very different than",
    "that april may time period where it was",
    "mainly patients from the metropolitan",
    "uh areas of the state and some of the",
    "suburban areas around the big cities",
    "uh where hospitalizations occurred i",
    "think one other major difference now",
    "is the number of odrc inmates that need",
    "to be in the hospital we're seeing",
    "far better uh numbers in terms of the",
    "number of",
    "inmates that need to be admitted the",
    "system for the state has done an",
    "excellent job once again of trying to",
    "take care of",
    "anyone who does uh become sick at their",
    "local facility",
    "uh but obviously we're here as a backup",
    "as a hospital for any of those uh",
    "inmates that need admitted so",
    "i think those are probably the biggest",
    "differences is in the distribution",
    "of the patients this time around as well",
    "as just the overall numbers",
    "so more more coming from the rural areas",
    "more",
    "more coming from a larger area of ohio",
    "going into the hospitals",
    "yes correct and we're now at uh we're",
    "now at a high",
    "but uh you know you know i've talked",
    "you're not alarmed at this point",
    "don't tell us kind of the level of",
    "concern that we should have because i",
    "get",
    "i get asked that question so i figured",
    "i'd put the expert on",
    "understand thank you sir understood i",
    "completely understand the question we've",
    "been having this discussion on all of",
    "our",
    "local and zone calls for the past two",
    "weeks because we've seen these numbers",
    "start to trend up a few weeks ago",
    "uh and and all of the hospital",
    "executives and administrative and",
    "clinical leadership that we talked to",
    "feel that",
    "at this time we're doing okay",
    "we the the concern i think that we have",
    "is we're not seeing",
    "the number of cases peak we're not",
    "seeing the number of hospitalizations",
    "peak",
    "and until we know where the peak of that",
    "curve is",
    "it's a little anxiety provoking to say",
    "if we got to double or triple the",
    "numbers we have now not saying that's",
    "where it's going to go but",
    "at this point we just don't know where",
    "it's going to top out so right now",
    "all of the hospitals that i speak with",
    "feel that they can manage this level of",
    "capacity",
    "you know back in the spring when we had",
    "somewhat similar numbers",
    "uh slightly less than where we are now",
    "the majority of our elective",
    "operations were actually shut down so we",
    "actually had a lot of extra hospital",
    "capacity",
    "where now we're back at a period of",
    "normal operations for our hospital so at",
    "some point",
    "if the numbers just continue to rise and",
    "rise and rise we'll run into",
    "some difficult decisions to make but",
    "right now we feel we have the capacity",
    "in our hospitals we have surge capacity",
    "especially in most of our larger",
    "hospitals to actually increase",
    "uh the volume of patients that we take",
    "care of so for the time being we're okay",
    "but at the same time if we don't start",
    "to see the numbers start to peak and",
    "come back down",
    "over the next few weeks uh you know",
    "heading into what is normally a winter",
    "flu season where we already see in",
    "december and january relatively high",
    "hospital",
    "occupancy numbers i think those two uh",
    "uh you know",
    "those two issues will uh collide at some",
    "point if we don't see a change",
    "in the trajectory of our total cases and",
    "our total hospitalizations over the next",
    "uh",
    "a few weeks well i know you've seen the",
    "chart i don't know if you can see this",
    "one but for",
    "our viewers um you know this goes from",
    "april to october 16th",
    "and this is the patient count in the",
    "hospital so it's not how many are going",
    "in every day but",
    "it's what the what the census basically",
    "is in the hospital",
    "and doctor you were talking about",
    "basically we don't know where this peak",
    "is we've not hit we've clearly not hit a",
    "plateau yet",
    "correct um and and so you know we",
    "you know we're always looking for that",
    "and always looking for that plateau",
    "we're really looking forward to go down",
    "but we're at least looking for",
    "a plateau but it's been a you know so",
    "this",
    "is uh for everyone this is the number in",
    "the hospital",
    "uh this down here the darker blue is",
    "in icu and below that is in",
    "those who have a vent so you can see",
    "those",
    "going going what's happening with those",
    "numbers the icu numbers and the",
    "ventilator numbers tend to lag the",
    "hospitalization",
    "numbers a little bit most patients when",
    "they present to the hospital don't end",
    "up in the icu",
    "for some do right off but most for a",
    "number of days later so",
    "those will tend to trend up as the total",
    "hospitalizations continue to trend up",
    "you know as hospital uh leaders and",
    "physician leaders nursing leaders",
    "pharmacy leaders we all are taught to",
    "prepare for the worst case scenario",
    "whether it's about",
    "any one individual patient or in this",
    "case uh",
    "a pandemic so i know all of my",
    "colleagues are thinking about where do",
    "we go",
    "if two weeks from now the numbers look",
    "like this or four weeks from now the",
    "numbers look like this",
    "we are preparing for the worst case",
    "scenario at the same time our goal in",
    "making sure people understand what they",
    "need to do to try to get these numbers",
    "to peak or the exact",
    "things that you describe uh on your",
    "press conferences and in your other",
    "speeches around the state it's it's",
    "it's relatively simple things wearing a",
    "mask distancing",
    "uh from others that don't live with you",
    "in your home washing your hands",
    "routinely and making sure that",
    "businesses in other public areas are",
    "keeping high touch areas clean",
    "of of any risk of having the virus on",
    "them the relatively simple things that",
    "will hopefully",
    "at to your point earlier even this",
    "afternoon sir that we've done this",
    "before we've",
    "we've bent the curve and and kept this",
    "from becoming",
    "a a worse problem than it's been twice",
    "over the past seven months and i'm sure",
    "the citizens of ohio are up to the task",
    "again",
    "so summary numbers going up throughout",
    "the state all three zones",
    "um much more coming from the rural areas",
    "than we saw",
    "in this in the spring and",
    "any one region i think you mentioned one",
    "region",
    "worse than the other or or since they're",
    "much different",
    "zone three which is the southwest",
    "portion of the state is seeing",
    "uh once again the highest numbers that",
    "they've seen at any time",
    "uh during the the pandemic they barely",
    "got to 300 patients i believe this",
    "morning they were in the 370 range they",
    "barely got to 300 patients over the",
    "summer",
    "so it is definitely feels very different",
    "to my colleagues",
    "down there we were just on a call",
    "yesterday morning uh discussing that but",
    "it's really",
    "it's it's distributed all across the",
    "state uh region seven and eight which",
    "are the rural",
    "zones for zone two are seeing the",
    "highest numbers over the past uh ten",
    "days that they've seen at any time",
    "during the pain",
    "which is generally southern ohio south",
    "central southeast ohio",
    "they're seeing more than they've ever",
    "seen correct correct",
    "doctor thank you very much appreciate it",
    "one more announcement interim director",
    "of health lance himes",
    "issued a directive to today to require",
    "all labs",
    "to start sharing all positive negative",
    "inconclusive and",
    "invalid test results related to cobia 19",
    "with the ohio department of health",
    "previously labs were reporting positive",
    "covered results at the individual",
    "level as an aggregate count for all",
    "other test results",
    "adding these categories will allow us to",
    "gather additional data for a more",
    "complete",
    "picture of how covet is spreading in our",
    "communities",
    "this also allow us to provide positivity",
    "data by county",
    "in the coming weeks something we've been",
    "looking forward to",
    "it will take some time for us to gather",
    "enough data to provide these positivity",
    "rates but",
    "we expect to have some information",
    "available by the second week of november",
    "barring any technical or reporting",
    "issues",
    "it wasn't just a question of issuing an",
    "order if it was we would issue the order",
    "a long time ago",
    "but to get to this point the ohio",
    "department of health developed a",
    "technology",
    "solution to allow their systems to",
    "receive negative",
    "test results the pandemic has shed a",
    "light on the need for better data",
    "collection methods and systems and this",
    "is one of the",
    "improvements that frankly they've been",
    "working on and we've been waiting for",
    "this will help address that issue in",
    "this specific area reduce",
    "a paperwork burden on local health",
    "departments and will help ensure that we",
    "have the fastest and easiest reporting",
    "process for all parties involved",
    "including labs",
    "and long-term care facilities so again",
    "positivity numbers by county that we can",
    "rely on",
    "um are coming coming soon",
    "let me go to the lieutenant governor see",
    "if he has",
    "comments governor",
    "um over uh over the past week you've",
    "really",
    "effectively explained what we are facing",
    "as a state with the increased number of",
    "cases",
    "the number of high incident counties",
    "that we see growing",
    "i noticed that on september the 19th",
    "we had 19 counties that were considered",
    "high incidents",
    "meaning that they had over 100 cases per",
    "hundred thousand as of today we have 69",
    "counties that that exceed that 100 cases",
    "per 100 000 and",
    "and as we saw on the chart earlier there",
    "are many counties that are",
    "300 uh 400 cases per 100 000",
    "which is a highly concerning number",
    "uh yesterday i spent some time calling",
    "around to some of those counties",
    "who were at the levels of 300 400 cases",
    "per hundred thousand",
    "uh and we talked we talked about the",
    "threat that that faces not just the",
    "state but those communities",
    "uh in that as it's getting colder as",
    "people are going to spend more time",
    "inside and unless we take",
    "some kind of action it's very hard to",
    "break that trend",
    "and and in these conversations we talked",
    "about",
    "how they can attack these issues at the",
    "local level",
    "we can make statewide policies but we",
    "know that",
    "from our our life's lessons that the",
    "closer you get to the source of the",
    "problem the more impact",
    "you can have on it and we talked",
    "we talked a lot about how to do that i",
    "would like to highlight one county that",
    "i really believe",
    "has taken this charge seriously and just",
    "give it a little explanation about",
    "what they're doing to try to coordinate",
    "in jackson county i want to highlight",
    "them they",
    "they have presently 333 cases per",
    "hundred thousand",
    "which is which is a high number the",
    "county commissioners there have",
    "initiated",
    "weekly calls with county-wide officials",
    "with all the mayors of their communities",
    "with the superintendents of schools",
    "with the health director for the county",
    "and and other",
    "health officials and emergency personnel",
    "to talk through the issues that their",
    "county is facing",
    "and how they can go about mitigating",
    "those issues",
    "this is an example of what every county",
    "can do",
    "to help bring their leaders together and",
    "controlling the spread",
    "we really need people to engage like",
    "this at the local level",
    "in identifying hot spots potential",
    "problems",
    "uh and that you know we we all have",
    "community connections this is an example",
    "of local government officials",
    "but but a lot of times there are",
    "networks of not-for-profits",
    "uh there are networks of businesses and",
    "business associations who can do these",
    "same kinds of things of",
    "of coordinating efforts learning from",
    "each other about best practices",
    "talking about for example if you're a",
    "business how to talk with your employees",
    "about after work and in their",
    "in their personal lives and how they can",
    "help to to mitigate the problem and",
    "and uh we're we want to thank those",
    "local officials",
    "and encourage them to take these",
    "leadership roles it's not just coming",
    "from",
    "the governor and from me it's everybody",
    "has the ability",
    "to be a leader in helping to slow the",
    "spread",
    "as the governor often says uh we can",
    "control this",
    "these are the facts but we can control",
    "by our behavior by our actions",
    "uh how bad this gets in the con in the",
    "coming months and",
    "just wanted to highlight uh jackson",
    "county uh",
    "for what they're doing and talk with",
    "and talk about what others can do uh and",
    "then finally a response to a question",
    "from last week in an update about the",
    "ohio high school athletic association",
    "and the events that they are overseeing",
    "and and how they're attempting to make",
    "sure that",
    "we don't have spread at those particular",
    "athletic events",
    "we we talked with the ohio high school",
    "athletic",
    "association last fall and for those of",
    "you don't know",
    "that it's part of our responsible",
    "restart for sports",
    "the ohio high school athletic",
    "association has hired what we call",
    "observers to go out and evaluate",
    "these game sites to educate the schools",
    "about what they can do to make sure that",
    "they're keeping the",
    "facility and the event is operating as",
    "safely as possible",
    "and to be accountable to provide those",
    "accountability measure measures",
    "the observers from the ohio high school",
    "athletic association in football have",
    "been",
    "have visited 458 sites",
    "uh and observed 600 football games",
    "uh at least 50 soccer games and at least",
    "50 or soccer matches and 50 volleyball",
    "matches",
    "over the course of the fall so far",
    "every visit results in a report back to",
    "the school",
    "to advise them on how they did",
    "what they can improve upon in some cases",
    "these reports have issued what they're",
    "what they would call a failing grade and",
    "we know nobody in school likes to get a",
    "failing grade",
    "uh and what what the athletic",
    "association",
    "reiterated to me on a call that we had",
    "and to discuss this was that this didn't",
    "mean that the school lacked a plan",
    "it didn't mean that they refused to",
    "follow the protocols",
    "it meant quite the contrary in most",
    "cases",
    "that schools did react well to",
    "uh the report that they were given um",
    "and that the report didn't lack a",
    "failure of an attempt but it really",
    "it really um focused on",
    "the failures to comply during the game",
    "and",
    "what they emphasized to us was that it",
    "wasn't a lot the fans",
    "it wasn't the ingress or egress or the",
    "it was a lot of times the student",
    "athletes themselves",
    "at a particular point in the game as you",
    "might have imagined where somebody",
    "scores a touchdown",
    "or somebody makes a great play or the",
    "game's close at the end that those",
    "students uh",
    "in their enthusiasm are congregating",
    "they're getting close together",
    "uh and and they're basically making the",
    "point to the schools that you got to try",
    "to control that",
    "you can't allow that to happen and the",
    "schools",
    "are being counseled on that those who",
    "those were there were extreme instances",
    "of of for example fans not wearing masks",
    "at the game",
    "those schools have received warning",
    "letters from",
    "the ohio high school athletic",
    "association and all of the schools",
    "who've received them have committed to",
    "improved compliance in those areas",
    "and the athletic association",
    "was not aware of an incident of spread",
    "due to",
    "any of these compliance lapses but",
    "they wanted to reassure us and the",
    "public that they",
    "have an accountability mechanism that",
    "they are sending observers out there",
    "that they and their member schools take",
    "these responsibilities seriously",
    "uh and the bottom line is because right",
    "now it's it's playoff season it's",
    "it's whether it's golf or basketball or",
    "or i mean golf or volleyball or football",
    "it's playoff season",
    "and the schools themselves and the",
    "student athletes themselves have the",
    "most at stake",
    "uh they they could lose their season if",
    "they don't comply",
    "and and um and so they felt good",
    "about where things are from the first",
    "game",
    "they saw they saw a lot of confusion uh",
    "week one",
    "uh but those educational opportunities",
    "have have",
    "made compliance and and helped the",
    "schools operate these",
    "these venues a lot more successfully",
    "over the course of weeks so",
    "governor that's the report back from the",
    "ohio high school athletic association",
    "uh and the accountability and and and",
    "and the potential lapses that have",
    "occurred during course of the fall",
    "thank you very much and uh shout out to",
    "our friends in jackson county",
    "um you know everything is local and the",
    "ability of communities to come together",
    "and talk about how they're going to",
    "fight back against the virus is really",
    "something that's just",
    "exceedingly exceedingly important",
    "let me just before we go to questions uh",
    "talk about",
    "sadly gun violence in ohio every week i",

    "that's pending right now in the general",
    "assembly",
    "it will save lives we'll go to the",
    "questions",
    "governor our first question today is",
    "from dan de rose at woio in cleveland",
    "good afternoon governor how are you dan",
    "governor i want to walk you through i",
    "hear from two types of",
    "uh people in ohio today i took a phone",
    "call about an hour before the news",
    "conference from a viewer",
    "who is very panicked at the numbers that",
    "are escalating",
    "basically saying you're not doing enough",
    "that you need to",
    "find some new level of either enforcing",
    "masks whether it's through",
    "enforcement tickets whether it's local",
    "police or maybe new levels of shutdowns",
    "as the numbers came out i took a text",
    "message from",
    "another viewer who said that at eight",
    "deaths",
    "today it's not that serious and that we",
    "should never have shut down",
    "two months ago so who's correct here who",
    "who is on the right side of this",
    "uh especially as numbers escalate",
    "you know i'm always saddened by people",
    "say we only lost",
    "eight people today i just that makes me",
    "sad",
    "because for each one of those people who",
    "died they had loved ones",
    "they were a mother father sister brother",
    "child",
    "and to trivialize these lives as as i",
    "hear some people doing is",
    "i just i i just do not do not understand",
    "it",
    "others others say well",
    "most of them were over 70. most of them",
    "had a medical problem",
    "i just i just don't know how we can",
    "respect life",
    "uh and and come up with that kind of uh",
    "attitude",
    "so it's it's it is serious",
    "uh to your viewer who",
    "said we should do more um i will tell",
    "you i asked myself that question every",
    "single day",
    "uh and i asked what else can we do",
    "uh we're significantly increasing the",
    "testing",
    "we're doing everything we can to get",
    "this out as as quick as we can",
    "i spent parts of the last eight or nine",
    "days flying around every media market in",
    "the state to talk directly to the people",
    "of that region about what we're seeing",
    "in the numbers",
    "but what we're seeing",
    "is most of the spread is coming",
    "from people who are doing informal",
    "things",
    "it may be in their home it may be in",
    "their backyard",
    "it may be getting together someplace",
    "else",
    "and people are letting their guard down",
    "when they're with friends",
    "they're laying their guard down when",
    "they're with family",
    "um and this is a virus that",
    "is is sneaky nasty",
    "because it rares up uh any place",
    "and many times the people who have it",
    "don't know they have it",
    "and they're carrying it and they can",
    "spread it",
    "we don't have the ability to go in",
    "people's houses and we don't want to do",
    "that",
    "but there is a remedy",
    "and the remedy is very much at hand",
    "and i think i got a call from a",
    "legislative friend of mine yesterday who",
    "told me about two different",
    "two different examples uh in counties",
    "that he represents",
    "uh where people were who in the past had",
    "not worn masks",
    "were wearing masks within the last few",
    "days",
    "basically he said they're concerned",
    "they're seeing these numbers go up",
    "they know more people who are coming",
    "down with it they're changing what",
    "they're doing",
    "so i'm optimistic it is within our",
    "capacity to change the future and the",
    "fastest way we can do it is for all",
    "not for me to issue some order uh",
    "that you can't enforce or be difficult",
    "to enforce",
    "but rather for every ohioan to take this",
    "seriously",
    "and just to think you know it's only a",
    "mask",
    "it's only a mask uh",
    "you know we think of sacrifices that",
    "have been made by people for this",
    "country",
    "uh they've been huge this is only a mask",
    "and we're just asking people to wear it",
    "uh there may be some people who can't",
    "wear one that's fine",
    "they had a medical problem that's fine",
    "but we get 85 90 95 percent of people",
    "wearing masks we'll knock this thing",
    "down",
    "and so to your your viewer your caller",
    "that's that's what i would say",
    "help us get that message across uh to",
    "everyone",
    "because what each one of us does",
    "determines whether our kids go to school",
    "whether we keep working uh whether we",
    "keep this virus down",
    "next question is from jim addie at",
    "w-h-i-o in dayton",
    "jim good afternoon i want to go back to",
    "the financial help that you're about to",
    "provide to people",
    "um what is the total dollar amount you",
    "have to work with this is from the cares",
    "act",
    "what your overarching goal is and how",
    "would that interplay with the federal",
    "stimulus money that is coming we think",
    "in a month or two or three whenever they",
    "figure that out on their end in dc",
    "how would that work together",
    "that's a very good question um we've got",
    "a lot of balls in the air and we don't",
    "know",
    "exactly what's going on because we don't",
    "know what the congress is going to do",
    "now i remain an optimist",
    "i think congress is going to take action",
    "uh i think there's a deal there to be",
    "had",
    "i think they will pass something this",
    "year i think when they pass it they will",
    "have more money in different",
    "different tranches different different",
    "causes different reasons",
    "but at the same time they will give us",
    "more flexibility that we can roll this",
    "money over",
    "so we're making decisions now jim uh",
    "based on not really knowing what the",
    "future is can we move this money across",
    "the line",
    "on on the 31st of december",
    "into the next year or can't we um and we",
    "don't really know",
    "what's coming so what we did was we",
    "tried to be conservative",
    "throughout this uh what we hope to be",
    "able to do is hold on to some of this",
    "money frankly so we can make sure",
    "that testing we always have enough money",
    "through testing until we get",
    "the immunity that we need that's going",
    "to come through we think through",
    "immunization",
    "so we're balancing all these things in",
    "our mind so what you're going to see",
    "us come out on probably on friday",
    "is a conservative approach which gets",
    "money out to clearly to people who need",
    "it right now",
    "with the understanding that there may be",
    "more money coming some of this may",
    "become from the federal government we",
    "may be able to take some money and put",
    "it out",
    "but i think as the governor of the state",
    "my obligation is first",
    "to make sure that we have the money",
    "necessary",
    "to cut to test as much as we can test",
    "as many tests as we can get in here and",
    "do the tracing the testing and the",
    "tracing and we've got to have",
    "money for that because if we can't do",
    "that we can't keep the virus under",
    "control if we can't keep the virus under",
    "control everything goes out",
    "out the window so it's a balance i'm an",
    "optimist i think congress is going to do",
    "something",
    "give us get a bill i think there's a",
    "deal there to be had",
    "governor can can i add a couple points",
    "there to that",
    "jim's question is that look we know this",
    "is a particularly difficult time for",
    "businesses as a lot of the federal",
    "assistances",
    "run out and and this is really helping",
    "to build a bridge",
    "to a better day to a federal plan to",
    "a time when the virus is is more under",

    "but as far as as far as adults having",
    "parties",

    "safe way to do it i think the answer is",
    "just don't do it",

    "been clear and now as you point out",
    "as your viewer pointed out the",
    "cases are up dramatically they're",
    "dramatically up in southwest ohio where",
    "you would assume most of the people will",
    "be",
    "will be coming coming from so i would",
    "just",
    "you know tell everyone they really need",
    "to wear a mask if they go to this event",
    "they need to keep some space um you know",
    "this is your life that's at stake",

    "to be there",
    "and you don't know even people who you",
    "know",
    "may be there don't know they have it but",
    "might have it so when you're",
    "going into an environment like that i",
    "would be very very",
    "careful i wouldn't wear a mask and i'd",
    "want to look around and see if other",
    "people",
    "were in mass i too again our message is",
    "the same whether it's a trump rally a",

    "next question is from laura hancock",
    "cleveland.com",
    "hey laura hi governor um we were",
    "wondering",
    "um you've talked a little bit about",
    "cases",
    "about the age going up in cases in",
    "recent weeks",
    "um so in other words cases of older",
    "people are increasing and we're",
    "wondering if you could elaborate a",
    "little bit on that why is that",
    "well i don't think anybody really knows",
    "for sure why that is but it is a marked",
    "change from june july when we saw the",
    "last",
    "bike we saw the last spike it was over",
    "you know 50 percent was under 30 years",
    "of age",
    "i don't have the numbers off the top of",
    "my head nor do i have a chart in front",
    "of me",
    "but these numbers are creeping up and",
    "so you know what we are assuming but",
    "don't really know",
    "we're assuming that this is a rebound uh",
    "from young people who had it earlier",
    "uh and who have infected older people",
    "um you know that's that's about the best",
    "we can do at least the best i can do",
    "as far as trying to figure out what what",
    "really is going on",
    "but it worries us because we know the",
    "older",
    "group of people you get the more likely",
    "they are to end up in a hospital",
    "the more likely they are to die so you",
    "know",
    "it doesn't mean that the 50 that in june",
    "were under",
    "under 30 or were totally safe but uh",
    "statistically you're you know you're",
    "going to have fewer people end up in a",
    "hospital a younger group so",
    "the age group is certainly is certainly",
    "certainly going up",
    "and it's worrisome and i'll try on",
    "thursday to",
    "break those numbers down a little bit",
    "further we'll take a look at where they",
    "are as of thursday",
    "next question is from jim province at",

    "western part of the state has been",
    "problematic for us for the last few",
    "weeks",
    "lucas and montgomery counties are both",
    "in the red now",

    "recall",
    "i've got check uh some of them did find",
    "a connection",
    "but i want to i want to verify that and",
    "we'll get back to you",
    "about about that um look",
    "anytime you get a group of people coming",
    "together in large numbers we",
    "you know we worry about and we certainly",
    "worry about if they're not wearing masks",
    "um you know we've seen a",
    "lot of spread particularly in southwest",
    "ohio",
    "all the way through this if you go back",
    "you know",
    "sadly montgomery county county right",
    "next door to",
    "fran i live greene county uh you know",
    "has been read",
    "an awful lot as this thing has gone",
    "through it so",
    "um certainly in in southwest ohio",
    "the virus is has been here and the",
    "numbers have been",
    "pretty high for a long time we've also",
    "seen",
    "you know along the particularly rural",
    "counties going up",
    "in northwest ohio particularly along the",
    "indiana border a couple counties even",
    "over",
    "at least two deep sometimes three deep",
    "those counties have been",
    "high for an extended period of time i",
    "mean some of those counties have been",
    "bred for",
    "12 i think 11 or 12 separate weeks",
    "so you know it it's",
    "these count these areas were already",
    "going the wrong way unfortunately",
    "next question is from max philby at the",
    "columbus dispatch",
    "hey governor max i wanted to ask",
    "if you could speak a little bit to the",
    "vaccine plan that's getting um",
    "published later this week online um is",
    "this supposed to be sort of a",
    "living document of sorts and can you",
    "speak a little bit more to the",
    "complexities of this distribution model",
    "yeah living document might be a good way",
    "to describe it um",
    "it is you know something the federal",
    "government wanted",
    "uh from us um our big you know",
    "our next step is to go online",
    "and get these different places signed up",
    "you know this is obviously being driven",
    "by the federal government by the",
    "administration",
    "they want to make sure the states are",
    "ready which i fully",
    "fully understand and appreciate that",
    "um you know a lot of this",
    "uh may be sent directly",
    "directly to the people who are going to",
    "end up",
    "administering it some of it",
    "it looks like will come to us so we can",
    "break it out into smaller",
    "parcels so that's just a basic",
    "distribution issue",
    "and again we're waiting for further",
    "information from from the federal",
    "government but i think part of it's",
    "going to go directly",
    "to a hospital you know bigger hospitals",
    "certainly",
    "don't get it directly you know other",
    "places may",
    "be more efficient for us to have to",
    "break it break it out it's going to come",
    "in fairly",
    "large chunks and um",
    "again we don't know when this is going",
    "to be uh",
    "you know you're following it just like",
    "we are on on on",
    "on tv um federal government has come up",
    "with some",
    "preliminary uh priorities they certainly",
    "are the logical",
    "priorities uh pretty much match what",
    "we've looked at",
    "which is we want to take care uh you",
    "know of",
    "the most vulnerable people first but",
    "also at the same time try to take care",
    "of uh",
    "you know get immunized those who are the",
    "front lines",
    "people who are dealing with people with",
    "coven we've got to get them taken care",
    "of early on",
    "so those two those two groups early and",
    "then we move into other",
    "groups beyond that",
    "next question is from jesse ballmer at",
    "the cincinnati enquirer",
    "hi governor um my question is looking at",
    "the high number of hospitalizations",
    "today",
    "are there any sort of changes that you",
    "would anticipate",
    "making if the surge if there was a surge",
    "such as limiting elective surgeries",
    "again",
    "and then a quick question are you or the",
    "lieutenant governor going to the",
    "defense rally in cincinnati tomorrow",
    "yeah you know i'm not going",
    "um i don't know whether lieutenant",
    "governor is going or not he can",
    "you can answer that um",
    "as far as what we do",
    "you know when elective surgeries were",
    "cut off and we issued an order on that",
    "that was at the",
    "at the advice of our hospitals um",
    "so you know in cincinnati i was in",
    "cincinnati",
    "uh on friday and",
    "right before i got there saw a story uh",
    "maybe in your story that basically said",
    "that uh you know they were quoted",
    "uh on the doctors uh as saying that",
    "you know we have two weeks cincinnati",
    "southwest ohio we got two weeks to get",
    "this under control and if we don't we're",
    "starting to jeopardize elective",
    "surgeries so we don't want to do i mean",
    "we don't want to see that",
    "and my point is if that's going to be",
    "driven by what the hospitals are seeing",
    "and what their space is",
    "and they're going to know and you know",
    "it may hit one hospital at one point",
    "another one at another point but",
    "you know we still have time we still",
    "have time uh",
    "to slow this down we do not want to be",
    "uh you know",
    "what what we've seen time and time again",
    "on tv beginning in italy and then new",
    "york and new york and",
    "different places we don't want to be",
    "that we have avoided it",
    "i would say to my fellow islands we",
    "we've done well we've avoided this we",
    "had a lot of great tragedy",
    "but we we've not had these huge spikes",
    "and uh we just don't want to see that",
    "and we can",
    "we really can control this we've got to",
    "control it",
    "now's the time now's the time to get on",
    "it we got to do it",
    "governor uh just quick answer to the",
    "question i visited with uh vice",
    "president pence last week when he was in",
    "columbus but i do not attend do not",
    "intend to uh go to the event tomorrow in",
    "cincinnati",
    "yeah let me just add one thing about",
    "vice president pence",
    "uh and i i talked to him you know",
    "regularly um he's done a phenomenal job",
    "with the",
    "white house task force we're on the",
    "phone generally once a week",
    "with in a bigger group sometimes",
    "one-on-one but",
    "always you know certainly in a bigger",
    "group with governors",
    "and uh you know very very",
    "focused uh he's been exceedingly focused",
    "on saving lives exceedingly focused on",
    "keeping the spread down and",
    "i appreciate what what he's done",
    "next question is from adrian robbins at",
    "wcmh",
    "in columbus governor",
    "you said what's at stake is our children",
    "being able to go to school",
    "you've left the decision on how to open",
    "up schools up to the local level up to",
    "this point",
    "but with the spread of the coronavirus",
    "happening statewide are you considering",
    "maybe statewide action on schools of",
    "cases continue to go up",
    "and just as a side note do you still",
    "plan on addressing the last call for",
    "bars and restaurants this week",
    "yeah we're not going to do that uh we're",
    "not going to do the bars and restaurants",
    "sadly um you know i understand",
    "i've heard talk to bar owners restaurant",
    "owners and i understand",
    "what's at stake for them but with these",
    "numbers going crazy",
    "we can't do this now so i hope in the",
    "future we'll be able to lift those hours",
    "but we're not gonna",
    "it would be in my opinion very",
    "irresponsible at this point",
    "for a governor to to do this so we gotta",
    "start getting those numbers get those",
    "numbers down",
    "and i'm sorry you had a second you got a",
    "second question i think",
    "yes sorry governor um my second question",
    "was just",
    "you've left the decision up to for",
    "schools up to the local level",
    "would you consider statewide action",
    "though if if cases continue to go up",
    "well i think you know there's there's a",
    "much better option and that better",
    "option is",
    "ohioans you know we're in the mask",
    "keeping safe uh we we can control this",
    "but i",
    "my point as i started uh was simply that",
    "there's a lot at stake as we see this",
    "spread",
    "and we're already seeing schools making",
    "decisions to go remote",
    "we're seeing schools making decisions to",
    "continue remote you know and",
    "many times we're seeing these decisions",
    "being made in our cities",
    "and so what's at stake is we have",
    "a large number of our children in our",
    "cities and other places",
    "who are totally remote and if we can't",
    "get control of this",
    "these schools are not going to flip back",
    "to hybrid or flip back",
    "to five days a week they're still you're",
    "starting to see them now make decisions",
    "to continue for the rest of the year",
    "rest of the calendar year",
    "at least remote",
    "and i think we should consider what",
    "impact that has",
    "on these children i'm not questioning",
    "why the schools are doing it but what i",
    "am saying is",
    "we can create a better environment so if",
    "these schools",
    "don't do this don't feel that they need",
    "to do this",
    "we can create the environment in our",
    "communities and it's incumbent upon us",
    "the adults",
    "to do that so that our kids can be in",
    "school",
    "now some kids are due very well remotely",
    "some kids have a lot of support they got",
    "parents",
    "um sometimes they got grandparents",
    "they're working with them",
    "they do okay we have other children who",
    "may not have that",
    "um and we we have to worry about them",
    "and we have to worry about the long-term",
    "impact of the of these children",
    "so we can control this",
    "and again my plea",
    "today again is let's do that for the",
    "sake of our kids",
    "next question is from alex ebert at",
    "bloomberg",
    "good afternoon governor there's a",
    "business roundtable group",
    "in ohio that is urging businesses",
    "to tell their workers",
    "to vote for republican-aligned",
    "candidates for the supreme court",
    "or risk losing their jobs as a",
    "prosecutor for years and as the state's",
    "attorney general who",
    "is before the justices in the court how",
    "does this make you feel",
    "about the way this group is portraying",
    "the the court and what will happen",
    "if certain justices are elected thanks",
    "well i don't know what the facts are and",
    "you know these these",
    "these are always fact driven obviously",
    "uh no one can or should tell their",
    "employee",
    "uh how to vote they can't",
    "tell them that if they vote a certain",
    "way that they're going to",
    "because they voted a certain way they're",
    "going to lose their job",
    "businesses based on the first amendment",
    "certainly have the right to tell their",
    "employees",
    "what they think um employees have equal",
    "right to do whatever they want to do",
    "and so but no one can condition a job on",
    "on how you vote",
    "first of all our ballots are secret and",
    "and",
    "are protected anyway but um so i don't",
    "know the facts",
    "but those would be the basic guiding",
    "principles that i think should guide us",
    "all",
    "next question is from laura bischoff at",
    "the dayton daily news",
    "um hi governor you talk about you you uh",
    "it's your understanding that a lot of",
    "the spread is from informal gatherings",
    "is that",
    "anecdotal or is there some real data",
    "from contact tracing that tells us that",
    "and also given the trajectory of ohio's",
    "numbers",
    "uh what are the risks of having three to",
    "four million voters going directly to",
    "the polls",
    "two weeks from now",
    "well secretary larose told me that he",
    "thinks it's very possible and this was a",
    "week ago",
    "so numbers may change but it's very",
    "possible that we'll have more people",
    "vote before election day than vote on",
    "election day",
    "uh even with an increased turnout which",
    "would appear we're having",
    "um it means that that people are going",
    "to be more spread out",
    "on election day uh i am not i think",
    "people can do this",
    "safely they've got to be careful um you",
    "know they need if they're",
    "they have ample opportunity to vote",
    "before they can do it by",
    "absentee ballot they can do go to the",
    "board of elections this weekend",
    "of course you know opens up weekend",
    "voting people go to the board of",
    "elections again",
    "they'll try to figure out when there's",
    "not a lot of people there stand in line",
    "keep the distance",
    "wear a mask um so",
    "i i think on election day yes people can",
    "go if they're careful",
    "um and and they can they can vote",
    "um so i think that you know",
    "they people have had a what's",
    "different about this is that people have",
    "had a long enough time",
    "to understand the virus and how it has",
    "spread",
    "so that they can take their own",
    "circumstances into",
    "uh account and make a decision do i want",
    "to",
    "go vote in person do i want to go",
    "sit in my home and and fill it out and",
    "never have to go out and so",
    "people had a chance to make those",
    "decisions they were making those",
    "decisions and",
    "you know i feel i feel that it certainly",
    "it can be but",
    "it's important it's important that",
    "everyone who go to the polls wear a mask",
    "you know you've got poll workers who are",
    "sitting there and poll workers i worry",
    "a lot about uh they're there for 13",
    "hours",
    "that's open the polls open and then i",
    "assume they get there an hour or so",
    "before",
    "and then after so they're there a long",
    "long day",
    "and for at least 13 hours they're",
    "directly in contact with",
    "with voters and so they you know",
    "we we should help them and make sure",
    "they can stay safe by everyone who goes",
    "through that line everybody who goes to",
    "vote",
    "uh should wear a mask",
    "next question is from josh roltenberg at",
    "spectrum news",
    "hi governor i just wanted to follow up",
    "on adrian's question i'm not sure you",
    "answered it directly are you considering",
    "statewide action on schools",
    "not at the moment",
    "yeah the answer is no yeah and i did not",
    "answer that",
    "and uh um not at the moment",
    "i mean the situation i described is",
    "where i think we are",
    "today we are a local government state we",
    "have relied on",
    "throughout our history we have relied on",
    "our local school boards",
    "our local families to make decisions",
    "about their schools",
    "um going through a very",
    "very tough period of time we still rely",
    "on those families",
    "to make decisions we give them a lot of",
    "guidance",
    "excuse me put on a mask order which was",
    "not very popular with",
    "some people uh and with the exception of",
    "uh",
    "you know one or two schools um",
    "teachers principals have done a great",
    "job",
    "students have done a great job in",
    "wearing masks and doing everything they",
    "can",
    "to to be safe while we have seen",
    "some cases certainly associated with",
    "schools",
    "the spread in schools themselves",
    "with students wearing masks we don't",
    "believe from what we're seeing",
    "is huge anytime you put people together",
    "there's a risk",
    "but they're doing it in the safest way",
    "as they can in person",
    "still there is always some risk",
    "and there's a particular risk when the",
    "county",
    "positivity rate is high the number of",
    "cases are high",
    "and so you know again one of the reasons",
    "we put out the",
    "color code one of the reasons we list",
    "the counties and so you can look and see",
    "how many cases are in your county",
    "relative to other counties for the last",
    "two weeks the reason we put that data",
    "out",
    "all the time every day is so that people",
    "can make decisions about",
    "should my child go to school should the",
    "school stay open what should the school",
    "do",
    "but we also know that",
    "in person for most kids",
    "is probably the best and is the best",
    "and so that's kind of where we would",
    "hope to get but we can't get there",
    "when we've got these high numbers so",
    "we've we've got to",
    "we we got to deal with the high numbers",
    "and we can deal with them but if we",
    "don't",
    "it's abundantly clear from what we're",
    "seeing is more schools are going",
    "online and more schools are extending",
    "online and some schools that were in",
    "person before now going online",
    "and that is a natural consequence of the",
    "rise in cases",
    "in in the community so it's incumbent",
    "upon the adults it seems to me",
    "to drive those numbers down and we have",
    "the power to do it",
    "next question is from jack windsor and",
    "wmfd",
    "in mansfield hey jack hi governor",
    "amy acton said that her dream was to",
    "have immunity certificates that would",
    "allow people to reclaim their freedoms",
    "and be admitted back to normal life",
    "she also indicated the desire to",
    "eliminate any exemptions for vaccines",
    "now dr fauci has signaled that the first",
    "vaccines may not be highly effective so",
    "given the fact that acton was so adamant",
    "and it appears he's still giving some",
    "advice to the administration for your",
    "previous comments",
    "two-part question is it your position to",
    "require vaccination and immunity proof",
    "in order to go back to normal life or",
    "will you backdoor mandate a vaccine by",
    "allowing businesses and schools",
    "to shut people out who don't choose to",
    "vaccinate",
    "jack i'm sorry you're still you're still",
    "uh attacking dr",
    "acton i you know i'm just sorry that you",
    "you feel it necessary to do that but",
    "i didn't attack dr act and i just i just",
    "indicated what she stated",
    "okay okay all right um",
    "look um we're not going to require",
    "anyone to get a vaccine",
    "that's not going to be any any",
    "requirement we hope people will get",
    "vaccines",
    "and i think that when people watch the",
    "process",
    "occur watch people go through it watch",
    "what the cdc says",
    "watch what the experts say say about",
    "this",
    "that they're going to have confidence",
    "and they'll they'll be willing to the",
    "you know significant number of people uh",
    "enough people",
    "uh will be willing to take the vaccine",
    "but we're not we're not we don't require",
    "any vaccination",
    "uh you know we don't require uh not",
    "gonna require them to",
    "take a vaccine we hope that they will",
    "and",
    "i think also we'll see when we'll see",
    "the results",
    "of what happens",
    "when the first responders take it and",
    "others take it",
    "and i think that will build i think that",
    "should build confidence in people",
    "that they'll want to take the vaccine",
    "but we're not going to require that",
    "governor next question is the last",
    "question today and it belongs to kevin",
    "landers",
    "at wbns in columbus",
    "hi kevin governor for seven months",
    "you've told people about the importance",
    "of wearing a mask if the numbers of",
    "positive cases are higher",
    "hospitalizations are higher than now",
    "ever before",
    "does this lead you to believe that",
    "irresponsible behavior is driving up the",
    "numbers and if so",
    "how do you combat that when your words",
    "don't seem to be resonating with people",
    "thank you well as i as i mentioned",
    "a little bit ago i got a call from a",
    "legislator talking about two rural",
    "rural counties where i know the spread",
    "has been high and and what he basically",
    "told me one to call me yesterday and he",
    "said look",
    "i want to tell you good news uh and he",
    "says",
    "a lot a lot more compliance in these two",
    "counties as i was events",
    "within the last i think week they said",
    "people are scared",
    "they're concerned uh and they're they're",
    "a lot more high",
    "compliance and he says i think that when",
    "people",
    "um are see what the reality is that they",
    "will",
    "you know more and more people will will",
    "wear a mask so",
    "i'm optimistic i think that we will see",
    "this",
    "and you know we saw it before um ohioans",
    "in june july when we started",
    "that's when we saw that surge we knocked",
    "that surge down",
    "and how did we do it well one of the",
    "main ways we did it was through wearing",
    "a mask",
    "and we saw mass compliance in our urban",
    "areas which is where at that time we",
    "were seeing a real",
    "real spike that mass compliance went up",
    "dramatically so i'm optimistic",
    "i think that again",
    "as communities come together uh which",
    "we're asking them to do to talk about",
    "this",
    "and and to you know talk about what is",
    "the best plan so they can keep their",
    "schools open",
    "uh best planned so they can move forward",
    "their economy",
    "i think they're going to you know come",
    "to the conclusion that this is",
    "what what has to be done and so i'm i",
    "think we're going to turn this thing",
    "around",
    "again we've done it twice before we can",
    "certainly certainly do it this time",
    "so that was the last question um",
    "i will close for where i began um",
    "these numbers are grim they are going",
    "the wrong direction",
    "every every everything is going the",
    "wrong direction",
    "but we know what will work we've done",
    "this before",
    "we've done on two other occasions and",
    "there is so much",
    "so much at stake and again to close",
    "where i started",
    "uh one of the most important things that",
    "is at stake",
    "is the education and the future of our",
    "children",
    "you know we do not want to skimp uh",
    "or in any way hurt the education of our",
    "young",
    "people and the best way to do that the",
    "best way to keep them in school",
    "is for each one of us to wear a mask",
    "each one of us to keep",
    "a distance each one of us when we're",
    "thinking about a halloween party",
    "say no we're not going to do it when",
    "we're thinking about",
    "getting together with friends or family",
    "who you know don't live with us",
    "closely um say look we gotta have a mask",
    "uh and we gotta be very very careful uh",
    "if we do that",
    "if we do that and i think we will uh",
    "we're going to knock this thing down",
    "and we'll have more of our kids in",
    "school and we'll be able to give them",
    "the education that we",
    "really uh owe them and that's what",
    "this is it's about a lot of things but",
    "certainly about our kids",
    "i look forward to seeing you all on",
