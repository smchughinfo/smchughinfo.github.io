    "so this is kind of this is a summary and",
    "we'll",
    "let me just get to that in a moment let",
    "me let me talk about",
    "some stories uh here we try to do this",
    "every week and again not to",
    "not to shame anybody but really it's",
    "just to try to",
    "understand about how this spreads",
    "and how easily it does",
    "this is spread associated with a funeral",
    "in jefferson county",
    "seven people are sick at least 22 have",
    "had to be quarantined",
    "the people who are quarantined are in",
    "two different counties",

    "and in west virginia",
    "uh in kaha county eight high school",
    "volleyball players tested positive for",
    "coven",
    "a few of the players attended a large",
    "graduation party",
    "a couple of weeks before they started",
    "feeling sick so again",
    "i know people are asking about sports",
    "and they're asking about what's going on",
    "in schools but by and large",
    "from what we can see it is",
    "other events it is not the sports",
    "competition at least so far",
    "uh that we're not seeing much in but it",
    "is students having parties and doing",
    "doing other other things um",
    "we have a couple new dashboards uh that",
    "we want to share with you",
    "um and uh",
    "you know our kids obviously only have",
    "one opportunity to grow up",
    "and it's up to us the adults to ensure",
    "that they have every opportunity of a",
    "bright future so um let me let me look",
    "at uh",
    "let's look at look at some of these and",
    "um",
    "eric you know i i forgot to give go",
    "through the",
    "map you want to go back to the map uh",
    "this is a map we haven't shown for a",
    "while this one over here",
    "um and these what you'll see is the red",
    "these are the red counties that are that",
    "are outlined in red",
    "and we believe although we may be behind",
    "in some of the data",
    "but the color",
    "fully remote is is the dark",
    "blue hybrid is the light blue",
    "and for those schools that are fully",
    "back",
    "uh five days a week uh it is in this",
    "more white or uh",
    "more whitish color um and so what we've",
    "done is just circle these so you can see",
    "in some counties",
    "they're almost mostly remote you can see",
    "other counties that",
    "you know they are totally open and again",
    "the only reason to show these is just",
    "encourage people in those counties you",
    "know",
    "try to keep do everything you can to",
    "keep the covet out of the school keep",
    "your kids playing sports keep your kids",
    "in school",
    "uh that's where we're seeing uh you know",
    "the red counties so",
    "um let's go to the next one eric um",
    "so this is our first school dashboard",
    "on september 3rd the health director",
    "signed an order",
    "establishing a reporting process for",
    "schools when they have covered cases",
    "in addition to notifying parents schools",
    "are required to report covered cases to",
    "the local health department",
    "who then reports them weekly to the",
    "department",
    "of health uh and so this is how it is",
    "how it looks and you'll be able you can",
    "go i believe it's up now",
    "uh or we'll be up sometime today uh",
    "you'll be able to go to the county and",
    "you'll simply be able to see how many",
    "how many cases in the last week",
    "how many cases that are cumulative",
    "so those numbers will change i believe",
    "the only schools that are up are the",
    "schools that have had",
    "incidents of cova and again i want to",
    "just",
    "say this because i think it's so very",
    "very important um",
    "because there's a student who's",
    "associated with a school",
    "who has tested positive is no reflection",
    "on the teachers the principal",
    "superintendent or anybody else school",
    "could be doing absolutely everything",
    "right",
    "the school is going to reflect what is",
    "going on in the community",
    "the fact that they have",
    "figured it out the parents have the",
    "school has that this student has at",
    "covid",
    "and they've taken the appropriate action",
    "working with the health department is a",
    "positive thing",
    "um and so we should look at that as a",
    "positive thing and again",
    "schools from what i can see and talking",
    "to superintendents",
    "uh and reports i'm getting back from",
    "parents i think are doing a very very",
    "good job",
    "but this is just one more effort to",
    "share",
    "information uh about what's going on uh",
    "in",
    "in regard to covet most important thing",
    "is that parents in that classroom",
    "where that child was or parents",
    "who have children who have been close in",
    "contact with that child",
    "certainly will that they're the first",
    "ones to get notified and that's the most",
    "important thing",
    "let's go to the children's dashboard",
    "this is a separate",
    "dashboard the next new dashboard is",
    "focused on children in covet",
    "it was created in consultation with the",
    "ohio children's",
    "hospital association we are blessed in",
    "ohio with some amazing children's",
    "hospitals sometimes we take them for",
    "granted",
    "until we have to take a child there or",
    "grandchild goes there and then we're",
    "we realize how lucky we are to live in",
    "ohio with so many great children's",
    "hospitals",
    "the dashboard includes information about",
    "cases hospitalizations and deaths",
    "one more troubling statistic and a lot",
    "of statistics and i'm going to ask dr",
    "manning in a moment to kind of",
    "i've asked her to take a look at this",
    "and you've heard from her before in",
    "these press conferences",
    "but but she will kind of ask her to take",
    "a look at the",
    "statistics and kind of report what she's",
    "seeing",
    "on there but these these will be",
    "available to the public today",
    "one of the more troubling statistics",
    "when you look at this data is that black",
    "children make up",
    "45 percent of all hospitalized children",
    "out of those children who in ohio who've",
    "gotten coveted",
    "but only 18 percent of the total",
    "population",
    "under 18 is black children",
    "african-american children so that is",
    "again a disturbing uh figure",
    "uh dr manning thank you for joining us",
    "are you",
    "on there thank you for coming back and",
    "we appreciate it",
    "very much here yes thank you very much",
    "for having me governor",
    "matt i'm really excited about this",
    "dashboard and the ability for families",
    "and pediatricians to see this",
    "kid's specific data um you know and",
    "you've been a great steward of the fact",
    "that data",
    "really builds trust through transparency",
    "it helps people feel informed",
    "it lets us know how we're doing as a",
    "region as a community as a school",
    "district and",
    "the data that's on the dashboard",
    "currently really reflects the experience",
    "that we've had across the state",
    "as we come together as children's",
    "hospitals through the ohio children's",
    "hospital association",
    "you've heard me share before that we're",
    "incredibly fortunate that",
    "children do not seem to get very ill",
    "with covet but they do get coveted",
    "and the data really reflects that we",
    "have fairly consistent numbers of",
    "children",
    "positive with covid but fairly also",
    "consistently low numbers of children who",
    "are hospitalized or who are severely ill",
    "with covid",
    "you know and finally the the last thing",
    "that this data really helps us do is it",
    "helps us track",
    "trends over time we want to know if this",
    "is going to change",
    "again we've been fortunate over time",
    "that the trends have stayed very low for",
    "children but if that changes the only",
    "way for us to know if that's changing is",
    "if we track",
    "that data over time well doctor",
    "talking about that we've been out there",
    "six months",
    "and i know you've been watching this",
    "very closely",
    "not only watching it but but dealing",
    "with with patients",
    "what have we learned and you talked",
    "about a little bit but what else have we",
    "learned about children during this",
    "period of time or maybe",
    "what don't we know well we do know that",
    "children who are older and more mobile",
    "and more social tend to be more likely",
    "to get coveted",
    "we do know that children as they get",
    "older and have other health conditions",
    "make",
    "could be more seriously ill um we also",
    "know that children",
    "can be asymptomatic with covid and that",
    "you know that specifically strikes a lot",
    "of fear uh for people i think that kids",
    "might be that there might be lots of",
    "children",
    "walking around carrying covet but you",
    "know on the on the reverse we also know",
    "through testing thousands and thousands",
    "of children in ohio",
    "before they go into surgery or have",
    "other procedures children who are",
    "asymptomatic we know that the percentage",
    "of those children is",
    "that have covet is exceptionally low",
    "it's about one percent",
    "uh and so even though we know that",
    "children can be asymptomatic with coven",
    "you know the overwhelming majority of",
    "children who are walking around without",
    "symptoms do not have covet",
    "which is very reassuring and finally",
    "we're learning and experiencing right",
    "now as kids go back to school that the",
    "practices that we've discussed before",
    "the",
    "safe practices of wearing a mask keeping",
    "some distance",
    "using hand hygiene and cleaning surfaces",
    "we know that those things keep kids safe",
    "and if kids are safe",
    "the adults in school are safe and if",
    "kids are safe the adults at home are",
    "safe",
    "so it's all connected that's great",
    "doctor thank you and",
    "and so for a parent a parent who's not a",
    "doctor let's say",
    "and who wants to look at this what",
    "what do you look at and how can you how",
    "can you use this how can this inform",
    "anybody who's watching today so i would",
    "tell parents of",
    "different age children look at the data",
    "as it's broken down by age groups that's",
    "incredibly helpful and again you'll see",
    "that in certain age groups the rates",
    "tend to be a little higher",
    "i would tell parents to look at the",
    "region in which they live",
    "um so that they understand what disease",
    "is like in their community",
    "as you've said that what's happening in",
    "the community really impacts what",
    "happens in the schools",
    "and then if and when we have data that's",
    "school specific i know that families are",
    "really really hungry for that kind of",
    "data it reminds me of the data that we",
    "shared within our health systems early",
    "on",
    "um that we were all hungry for we wanted",
    "to know how many patients were positive",
    "how many",
    "staff members might be positive because",
    "that informed how we move forward",
    "and finally i would really emphasize",
    "that this data is so critically",
    "important for primary care providers and",
    "pediatricians",
    "pediatricians always have their finger",
    "on the pulse of what's going on in the",
    "community they're always aware of what's",
    "what's going around whether it's strep",
    "or flu or things like that",
    "and now this really enriches their",
    "knowledge even more so that if somebody",
    "were to go to their pediatrician",
    "and that pediatrician knew that that",
    "coveted was",
    "occurring at different rates in that age",
    "group or in that region",
    "that would really impact how they would",
    "practice with that family and that child",
    "um",
    "so lots of richness in this data great",
    "let me just close with one",
    "last question we had reported yesterday",
    "a case of flu",
    "it was an adult was not a child in",
    "putnam county",
    "so we're getting into the flu season and",
    "i wonder",
    "what is the protocol what's the",
    "recommendation",
    "in regard to children as far as flu",
    "shots",
    "so thank you so much for referencing",
    "that governor because it's so important",
    "this season more than ever that children",
    "six months and older can get a flu shot",
    "starting now",
    "starting today this is the time to do it",
    "before the season's really busy before",
    "so that you have a chance to develop",
    "your response you really don't want to",
    "be",
    "the parent of the child who experiences",
    "what it's like to have a child who has",
    "flu and covet we don't want to learn",
    "what that is we may have to learn that",
    "but we shouldn't have to learn that",
    "because a flu vaccine",
    "is so helpful and so preventative so go",
    "today start today contact your",
    "pediatrician",
    "and get your flu shot doctor",
    "thanks for joining us again and we hope",
    "to",
    "bring you back if you're willing to in",
    "the in the future we appreciate it",
    "absolutely",
    "very much um to continue on",
    "what dr manning said last week friend i",
    "got our flu shots john got his flu shot",
    "as dr manning said it's critically",
    "important to get a flu vaccine this year",
    "we are now in into the into the season",
    "even though the flu obviously cannot",
    "protect you from covet",
    "as dr manning said it's this is not",
    "something that we",
    "any of us adults or children want to",
    "learn about how kovad",
    "and the flu together work uh not",
    "something we want to see",
    "it really the flu shot's another layer",
    "of protection uh to keep yourself your",
    "family those who",
    "you love and who are around you healthy",
    "uh getting the shot helps reduce",
    "your risk of spreading that flu prevents",
    "strain on our healthcare system",
    "and our healthcare providers keeps our",
    "workforce",
    "healthy it also can keep you from",
    "getting really sick",
    "and one of the things that the doctors",
    "tell us",
    "that if it may not even if it doesn't",
    "totally prevent the flu",
    "it may decrease the severity of",
    "of that illness which is so very",
    "important and particularly important",
    "this year when the covet is out there",
    "as well flu shots are available at your",
    "doctor's office retail pharmacies",
    "federally qualified health",
    "centers that we have throughout the",
    "state also have the flu shot available",
    "so one things that i've enjoyed doing i",
    "hope you have as well is hearing from",
    "some of our superintendents",
    "out there who are doing something that",
    "superintendents have",
    "not had to do for a hundred years and",
    "that is deal with",
    "with a real pandemic and i think they're",
    "doing a very very good job",
    "first up is justin jennings uh chief",
    "executive officer of youngstown city",
    "school district",

    "able to uh you know have a laptop or",
    "some way to pull that down so you're",
    "you've taken care of basically 100 of",
    "your students out there you think uh who",
    "now has",
    "have the ability to connect in yes yep",
    "if they um if they have hot spots we try",
    "to provide one for each scholar at the",
    "house because we know sometimes if you",
    "have four or five people",
    "on the internet at the same time it",
    "doesn't run as fast and if they",
    "didn't have anything we we provided a",
    "home from spectrum",
    "we provided a home internet access for",
    "them so",
    "tell me a little bit about uh",
    "how your teachers are doing and you know",
    "how how this learning",
    "uh is going well because because we",
    "started so",
    "so early we it afforded us the",
    "opportunity to",
    "train our teachers in the summer so it's",
    "still a learning curve zoom is new for",
    "everybody i mean",
    "i don't think any anybody who said you",
    "wanted to be an educator early i don't",
    "think they had a class on remote",
    "learning so this is something that's",
    "kind of a learning curve for all of us",
    "and the teachers have been very positive",
    "more for their health and safety",
    "it has been something that's been really",
    "positive we're still allowing our",
    "teachers to work from home",
    "or they have the choice with social",
    "distancing to work from their classroom",
    "tell me a little bit about wellness",
    "dollars",
    "one of the things that the legislature",
    "provided",
    "and you know we came up with this",
    "proposal sent to the legislature they",
    "embraced it was the wellness dollars and",
    "you and i were talking the other day a",
    "little bit about that you want to tell",
    "us how what you've done",
    "with those and because i thought that",
    "was kind of it was unique what you're",
    "doing really",
    "right absolutely i mean we know we know",
    "that health and wellness is really",
    "something that's positive that comes out",
    "from",
    "this culvert virus is really looking at",
    "the disparities in in our health care",
    "system and",
    "one of those things for youngstown city",
    "schools is we don't have any",
    "pediatricians within our city limits to",
    "service our scholars",
    "so what we decided to do with our",
    "wellness dollars is we we've teamed up",
    "with quick meds and dr",
    "ishmael and we we're going to have a",
    "clinic in each of our of our high",
    "schools that is going to be open",
    "from 10 to 6 every every day during the",

    "uh we're also going to have vision there",
    "as well so dr siegel from uh",
    "um site for all will be be there as well",
    "and that's the opportunity for us to do",
    "this and our plan in the future is to be",
    "able",
    "to expand and have a clinic at each",
    "school to service not only our scholars",
    "and teachers but our community as well",
    "wow that's a that has to be have a huge",
    "impact uh when that's all",
    "online a huge impact not only with the",
    "students but with their families and",
    "people other people in the community",
    "absolutely absolutely we",
    "we have a large uh percentage of our",
    "scholars who have family members who",
    "have been incarcerated so when they come",
    "out",
    "they don't have the opportunity for that",
    "health care as well so we're going to",
    "provide it for them as well",
    "well i think that's really that's really",
    "exciting what's the timeline on that how",
    "soon does that",
    "kick in we'll be we'll be open and ready",
    "for business in",
    "late october early november so we're",
    "just getting the space together and then",
    "we'll be good to go maybe a little",
    "earlier than that",
    "so with the students remotely though",
    "you'll still you're still going to open",
    "this",
    "up for students to come in and for",
    "community members yes by appointment we",
    "will be prepared we'll follow all those",
    "guidelines that we",
    "we have normally with the social",
    "distancing but with temperatures and",
    "different things like that so",
    "we've actually been using quick med to",
    "do our testing for all of our scholar",
    "athletes our clothing testing so that's",
    "kind of how we started the relationship",
    "well that's great thank you very much i",
    "i was really excited about that when i",
    "you and i talked the other day and i",
    "wanted you to share it with uh",
    "with everybody in the state so thank you",
    "very much",
    "good luck thanks to your students and",
    "your teachers we thank them",
    "for all they're doing uh next",
    "i've invited uh greg enninger",
    "uh the superintendent of vanguard",
    "sentinel career and technology centers",
    "they have campuses in tiffen uh in",
    "fremont",
    "uh thank you very very much for for",
    "joining us we",
    "we we appreciate it uh you've got uh",
    "most kids most your students back on",
    "campus now do you",
    "we do thank you for having me uh sir uh",
    "governor dewine",
    "uh we do we we have about a thousand",
    "fifty-one kids on campus",
    "um we did start our start the school",
    "year on a hybrid system",
    "i mean our goal from the from the start",
    "of the",
    "end really of last school year was to do",
    "whatever we needed to do",
    "to open school with students on our",
    "campuses",
    "we really believe that careertech",
    "education is instrumental in our",
    "community and providing a trained",
    "workforce",
    "and we think that really became you know",
    "really apparent during the pandemic",
    "pandemic when you saw the workforce that",
    "were deemed essential",
    "there's just about every career field",
    "that we have students training for",
    "and to properly train them eventually",
    "they have to get into the lab they got",
    "to practice they got to demonstrate",
    "they got to do that hands-on portion",
    "which is paramount to their overall",
    "skill development of their",
    "of their career and to have that ability",
    "to pass",
    "on that specific industry credential so",
    "we really did put in a lot of safety",
    "requirements we followed the state",
    "requirements we followed",
    "industry sector specific requirements if",
    "they were above and beyond what the",
    "state had put out",
    "we really felt that was important to",
    "stay in line with business and industry",
    "because that students would be seen in",
    "their early placement opportunities or",
    "full-time",
    "job opportunities so then we decided we",
    "basically created three schedules",
    "that tried to hit every scenario that we",
    "might",
    "might face we did do it all students",
    "back",
    "a flexible hybrid that reduced kids to",
    "50",
    "capacity and a full distance remote",
    "learning if we if we had to",
    "but as i said there's only so much",
    "online related work you can do with with",
    "the hands-on and the career tech",
    "but we did start in a hybrid um system",
    "to give us the ability to",
    "kind of start slow uh it was new for",
    "for staff making sure all the social",
    "distancing was taking place",
    "the face covering the hygiene",
    "pieces were all being followed and then",
    "what we did look at",
    "governor was we didn't look at every lab",
    "the same",
    "i mean every lab is a different size",
    "every enrollment might be",
    "might be different so we kind of took",
    "the approach of",
    "if we can continue to maintain the the",
    "safety requirements",
    "our goal was to get students back fully",
    "and we were able to do that",
    "actually started this week four days a",
    "week we have all students except for",
    "in three labs that that we didn't feel",
    "like we could maintain that safety",
    "requirement so we kept them on",
    "on the hybrid everybody else is back and",
    "we left the wednesdays",
    "as a distance learning day um",
    "for staff for additional planning and",
    "for us to be able to do an",
    "additional deep clean above and beyond",
    "what we",
    "are already doing so you've had to",
    "really approach this",
    "as a school but also as a business or a",
    "manufacturing company or whatever",
    "the the skill set is so you've had to",
    "pull",
    "best practices from industry plus best",
    "practices from",
    "from schools so that's been a",
    "interesting challenge i'm sure",
    "absolutely if you would walk in a few of",
    "the labs such as",
    "our cosmetology or health lab you would",
    "see a double barrier system because",
    "that's what's happening out in",
    "in industry they have their face mask",
    "and a face shield on",
    "um so they are found and then staff is",
    "doing an outstanding job",
    "even when they came back they came back",
    "with even more ideas",
    "of how they could create a a more safe",
    "environment to get",
    "the students back on a full-time basis",
    "versus a hybrid so",
    "it's been a great start thus far",
    "so i know this has been a difficult time",
    "your instructors um how are they doing",
    "your teachers how are they doing how",
    "how are the students doing yeah the",
    "students i'll tell you everybody um",
    "really bought into to the safety we",
    "haven't had any",
    "major issues with that staff like i said",
    "it has just been",
    "outstanding with with getting their",
    "their labs and classrooms ready",
    "and prepared for students they all",
    "wanted to see the students get back on",
    "campus as well",
    "and without that that proactive approach",
    "i think from our",
    "staff and knowing what they need to do",
    "inside lab",
    "portrayed to getting the students back",
    "full time on on those four days so i",
    "think everybody's doing really well",
    "the kids are are working hard um and and",
    "getting those skills that that that the",
    "employers need to",
    "to meet the uh job outlook",
    "well that's great well thank you so much",
    "for joining us and uh",
    "best wishes to all your all your team",
    "thank them for their",
    "their hard work and uh thank the",
    "students for their hard work",
    "appreciate you thanks for having us",
    "appreciate it thank you",
    "since the start of the pandemic we've",
    "worked hard to make sure we're",
    "protecting ohio's",
    "critical infrastructure workers who",
    "keep food on our tables keep us healthy",
    "keep us safe indeed in our critical",
    "emphasis",
    "indeed uh critical infrastructure",
    "is part of that and some of the most",
    "important people are migrant workers",
    "our seasonal workers we've been working",
    "with local health departments across the",
    "state to monitor",
    "and assist when outbreaks occur on the",
    "farms where they work",
    "in ohio there are currently around 5 600",
    "known migrant and seasonal workers who",
    "work at camps licensed",
    "by the state of ohio many owners and",
    "operators of these camps also provide",
    "housing for workers and their families",
    "this creates kind of a unique situation",
    "for these communities where individuals",
    "are working",
    "traveling living together often and",
    "often in very close proximity to each",
    "other now these unique circumstances",
    "have created a situation where workers",
    "and their families",
    "are are many times impacted uh by this",
    "covid virus",
    "since the beginning of the pandemic",
    "we've been reaching out to these",
    "communities",

    "services outreach",
    "uh providing materials in english and",
    "spanish to help workers stay safe from",
    "cover 19 at work at home",

    "covet 19 outbreak",
    "occurs when one of them occurs a swift",
    "coordinated response can significantly",
    "reduce spread and help those that are",
    "sick",

    "we're going to today",
    "release our rapid response guide for",

    "kind of diagram or chart which i did not",
    "bring",
    "nor do i have in front of me but it",
    "shows that how seasonal workers come in",
    "at different periods of time basically",
    "starting in march and so it's a it's an",
    "on it's an ongoing process",
    "and so you know it's it's not going to",
    "be too many more months until that",
    "process is starting again so we're glad",
    "to get this",
    "document out as part of what we've what",

    "a quick waste wastewater update",
    "since mid-july ohio's coronavirus",

    "plants around the state to test",
    "for gene fragments of cova 19.",
    "our team along with university",
    "researchers",
    "has seen a recent steady increase in the",
    "number of viral gene copies",
    "at two wastewater treatment plants one",
    "is in dayton",
    "the other is a columbus plant referred",
    "to as the jackson",
    "pike plant these findings",
    "are information that we very quickly",
    "pass on to the local health department",
    "many times the health department is",
    "directly involved in the gathering",
    "of this data but the point is to get it",
    "to the people who can use it",
    "right on the ground the ohio department",
    "of health",
    "notified in one case the dayton",
    "montgomery public health and",
    "the columbus public health systems to",
    "allow them to take appropriate action",
    "again one more piece of information uh",
    "and we think as this",
    "continues to evolve uh it's going to",
    "provide more",
    "and more better information",
    "testing of wastewater for cover 19 gene",
    "frac fragments",
    "can also be done on a smaller scale to",
    "focus on targeted locations within a",
    "treatment plant service area for example",
    "the ohio state university has started",
    "monitoring six",
    "separate locations on campus samples",
    "collected are being used by ohio state",
    "alongside rapid student testing that",
    "they're doing to better track cobit 19",
    "on campus",
    "the goal is to use these two data sets",
    "to identify possible",
    "infection spots that's what ohio state's",
    "doing with the",
    "with the uh with those two uh",
    "rapid student testing as well as the",
    "samples that we're talking about",
    "we are currently testing in more than 30",
    "cities across the state we'll expand",
    "testing to more than 50 locations",
    "uh in the next month all right we've got",
    "a lot of questions",
    "about halloween and we will be putting",
    "out some",
    "guidance tomorrow and so you can look",
    "for that actual guidance tomorrow",
    "now halloween historically in this state",
    "has been a very community event",
    "beggar's night has been a community",
    "event and communities set the time",
    "themselves uh they make the",
    "determination about that so that will",
    "not change",
    "the local community will make the",
    "determination if there's a beggar's",
    "night",
    "when that beggar's night is they will do",
    "that i'm sure",
    "in consultation with with their local",
    "local health",
    "departments parents in turn will do what",
    "parents do and that is make a decision",
    "uh about whether a child goes out on and",
    "trick-or-treating",
    "obviously celebrations this year will",
    "not look like those in the years past",
    "again face coverings and of course that",
    "may not be a problem with",
    "trick-or-treaters who are wearing a mask",
    "and something else but",
    "it's important to have that some mask on",
    "hay rides haunted houses are much more",
    "problematic",
    "again we kind of come back as you look",
    "at these things and",
    "look at how close you are or your",
    "children are going to be",
    "to others many times hear strangers",
    "how close they're going to be do they",
    "have a mask on",
    "do the other people have a mask on and",
    "how long in proximity does that",
    "last so when you look at for example",
    "the haunted houses",
    "you know probably a much higher risk",
    "than the normal uh trick-or-treating",
    "just because of the close proximity",
    "uh inside those haunted houses so we'll",
    "we'll continue we've got a while to go",
    "uh until halloween we're gonna put the",
    "initial guidance out",
    "uh for everyone because we're getting a",
    "lot of requests about that",
    "as the virus evolves",
    "again we will continue to update that if",
    "that is in fact appropriate",
    "and again in making all these decisions",
    "as parents um",
    "you know you make those decisions based",
    "upon all the information that you can",
    "get",
    "uh with our color coding and all the all",
    "the other things that we're providing",
    "you know one one of the factors",
    "obviously is how much spread is there in",
    "in your community and so that's again",
    "something that you can you can",
    "consider um so we'll be having more",
    "information",
    "uh about that uh as i said we'll try",
    "we're gonna put our release out tomorrow",
    "um and just kind of outline",
    "recommendations from the state health",
    "department",

    "to you said you were going to donate it",
    "to charity",
    "uh i will check with that as i recall",
    "we gave that money to the food banks in",
    "ohio but i'll",
    "confirm that with laurel and",
    "my team and make sure that we get you",
    "that",
    "exact information",
    "next question is from jeff redick at",
    "wsyx",
    "in columbus afternoon governor",
    "a newly released report that was",
    "obtained by abc news",
    "coming right from the white house showed",
    "that franklin county is still a county",
    "that is of",
    "at least some concern if not major",
    "concern for the federal government",
    "uh franklin county of course on the",
    "state's",
    "kind of color-coded heat map has gone",
    "down and remained in orange",
    "but i'm wondering if you still have",
    "great concern for franklin county as it",
    "leads the state or if",
    "that orange level is in any way",
    "if you think dissuading people from",
    "taking the necessary precautions",
    "well we ask people to look at two things",
    "and i don't know eric you have the",
    "ability to put the",
    "top 20 back up again",
    "we look at two things and we ask them to",
    "look at two things because",
    "you can't get a picture by just one set",
    "of statistics like",
    "it's like a baseball player you know you",
    "know what they batting average but if",
    "you don't know",
    "runs bad at in and et cetera then you",
    "don't have the full picture",
    "and so we try to give them as much",
    "information as we can",
    "uh if you if you look um",
    "look on here franklin county has can't",
    "remember what franklin county number was",
    "uh but i have i have those i have those",
    "numbers",
    "of incidents but their their",
    "incident numbers have stayed it's",
    "continued to stay high so we",
    "you know we are concerned about that um",
    "and we remain concerned about it",
    "so um you know you look at you look at",
    "two",
    "things you look at the list you look at",
    "the look at the",
    "at the color code so i mean",
    "one thing the federal government has you",
    "know",
    "they go by positivity",
    "which is an interesting number per",
    "county",
    "we hope to have positivity numbers up",
    "for every county",
    "shortly we think candidly",
    "that the federal government's positivity",
    "numbers are not",
    "always as precise as they could be",
    "because it's our my understanding is",
    "they are using the hospitals",
    "so my understanding is that if someone",
    "comes out of circleville",
    "they're in in a franklin county hospital",
    "that that would be attributed uh to",
    "franklin county so",
    "we're we don't think those numbers are",
    "exactly right but we do agree with the",
    "federal government",
    "uh that there is a certainly a concern",
    "with franklin franklin county",
    "and look a lot of this is is we're",
    "looking at a lot of what's going on with",
    "thousands and thousands of students who",
    "are back in school",
    "uh you know what we continue to see",
    "uh i think our schools are doing a good",
    "job uh ohio state who's the biggest one",
    "obviously in franklin county i think",
    "it's doing a good job",
    "uh the testing tracing but what we",
    "continue to see from",
    "at all universities is off-campus and",
    "off-campus activity",
    "and so we you know we worry we worry",
    "about that as well but",
    "the mayor and i talk a lot we talked",
    "earlier today and",
    "we continue to stay in very close touch",
    "as we do with the two health departments",
    "next question is from joe ingles at ohio",

    "thing we've done with churches is to",
    "require",
    "mask by the person who's not the",
    "celebrant or",
    "person who's not talking but so we've",
    "done that",
    "in regard to demonstrations and i know",
    "some people",
    "were irritated with me about this but we",
    "said look",
    "this is an exercise of first amendment",
    "now at the same time",
    "we said please please please wear a mask",
    "uh keep us distance and and every time",
    "we continue to talk about that",
    "political campaigns whether it's joe",
    "biden",

    "it's the president trump",
    "or whether it's a local candidate if",
    "they're having a political rally",
    "we do not we exclude them",
    "from that order but",
    "we really urge anyone who's conducting a",
    "rally",
    "anyone who's attending a rally",
    "while we don't require you to do it uh",
    "the order does not say you have to",
    "but please wear a mask please",

    "you know we would just ask them please",
    "wear a mask um",
    "you think that is just you know just",
    "absolutely vitally",
    "vitally important next question is from",
    "ben",
    "schwartz at wcpo in cincinnati",
    "hi governor hi ben i have a question",
    "here sent",
    "in from a wcpo viewer um this viewer",
    "says her father",
    "is in a nursing facility and that she's",
    "sent countless emails to your office and",
    "other state agencies asking to see some",
    "change in how",
    "nursing facilities are handling covet",
    "19.",
    "in this viewer's words she asks quote",
    "what is",
    "what is visitation going to look like",
    "going forward",
    "within a month it's going to be too cold",
    "outside to have outside visitation",
    "end quote this is just a number of",
    "one of a number of concerns raised by",
    "our viewers so",
    "i guess the overall question is moving",
    "forward how will we see rules and",
    "guidelines regarding nursing home",
    "visitations evolve",
    "and could we expect to see any more",
    "lenience",
    "on visitations in any way well",
    "we get these calls and my heart goes out",
    "to anybody who's",
    "not being able to visit their loved one",
    "uh for",
    "a number of months uh we have opened up",
    "nursing homes as far as",
    "the state's orders the health orders",
    "we've said they can provide visitation",
    "we suggest uh and say that it should be",
    "outside",
    "uh we know that winter will come",
    "eventually uh",
    "much as we don't want to come and so",
    "we're now working on how visitation can",
    "take place inside",
    "if you have a loved one and you cannot",
    "get into a nursing home",
    "that is the nursing home that is",
    "stopping you from going in",
    "it is not the health department",
    "so again they may have a reason they may",
    "have a good reason",
    "but it is it is not the health",
    "department we have",
    "for a number of months said people",
    "should be able to visit",
    "loved ones in a nursing home now look we",
    "don't want anybody going in there",
    "you know visiting who's sick you know we",
    "want them doing it outside we want to",
    "wear a mask",
    "so you know those are normal precautions",
    "that we",
    "you know know should take place and",
    "expect to take place",
    "but i continued also to get calls i",
    "continue also to get texts and emails",
    "from people who say i can't go visit my",
    "loved one",
    "and you know again that that is",
    "something that we are not stopping",
    "uh that is that is the nursing home that",
    "is not letting you in",
    "and now as i said they may have a good",
    "reason uh",
    "but that's you should contact that",
    "nursing home and find out what that is",
    "next question is from max philby at the",
    "columbus dispatch",
    "hey governor max just looking through",
    "the",
    "school database put out today it looks",
    "like most of the data is on the district",
    "level",
    "and considering the fact that some of",
    "these school districts have dozens of",
    "different",
    "schools and buildings wouldn't it be",
    "more helpful to uh",
    "list it via building as opposed to",
    "district-wide",
    "well we get into the question um and",
    "we've discussed this before uh",
    "i don't know whether you and i have",
    "discussed it but the issue",
    "uh about the law saying that you cannot",
    "put out",
    "information that would identify someone",
    "as having covet or identifying anything",
    "about health",
    "issues around one individual we've",
    "always felt that the most important",
    "thing was that",
    "parents parents of children in that",
    "school will be notified",
    "so they are being notified",
    "first of all the parents of any child",
    "who came in contact with that child",
    "who was sitting with that child anything",
    "else that's those are the first people",
    "that should be contacted",
    "and to my knowledge are being contacted",
    "by our school second",
    "you have a child in that building and",
    "there's some coveted in that building or",
    "a child has built",
    "as coveted you're supposed to be",
    "notified so those are the people who",
    "have the most it seems to me",
    "important that they they in fact be",
    "notified we've encouraged schools",
    "to put dashboards up so that anybody in",
    "the community",
    "can can look up and and find that out",
    "but we can't micromanage this and we",
    "can't micromanage it down to the point",
    "where in a small school system they",
    "might",
    "be giving out information that would",
    "identify someone as having coveted which",
    "is illegal",
    "we cannot no they cannot do that we",
    "cannot do that i cannot require them and",
    "should not require them",
    "to do that so what we said at the",
    "beginning and we had people",
    "with people in schools who said you know",
    "this is too burdensome uh we had other",
    "people uh",
    "you know in the press who said you're",
    "not giving us enough",
    "we're gonna let this run for a few weeks",
    "we're gonna kind of see how it works out",
    "we're going to see how the information",
    "is flowing out and then",
    "you know if it's appropriate to to",
    "adjust it further",
    "we will certainly do that but you know",
    "again",
    "our goal throughout this has been put",
    "out a lot of information",
    "we've been focused most particularly",
    "though on actual information",
    "something you can take and do something",
    "with that with that piece of information",
    "but we're trying to get as much",
    "information as we legally can",
    "can get out",
    "next question is from laura hancock at",
    "cleveland.com",
    "thanks governor two quick questions um",
    "convention centers",
    "are still not allowed to operate in ohio",
    "as like their normal intended way",
    "any update on when gatherings more than",
    "10 people might be allowed in convention",
    "centers",
    "and then the second has to do with the",
    "school dashboard",
    "is the data helpful when it contradicts",
    "what individual school dashboards are",
    "saying",
    "cases on the state dashboard seem to be",
    "far fewer than what schools have",
    "previously",
    "reported for instance in cuyahoga county",
    "health officials announced 51 cases",
    "in individual districts up from 23 the",
    "previous week",
    "the state's dashboard is only showing",
    "three",
    "i'll check on it look this thing went",
    "live today",
    "there's bound to be problems um we're",
    "going to fix the problems",
    "you know keep in mind that this goes",
    "through sunday",
    "uh and so the data would be relevant as",
    "of sunday if somebody makes an",
    "announcement something happened monday",
    "tuesday or wednesday then it would be",
    "different",
    "i don't know if that's the situation",
    "here or not but we certainly",
    "will run everything down we have no",
    "incentive not to have accurate",
    "information",
    "and we're going to try to make make it",
    "accurate but",
    "again a lot of schools 600 some school",
    "districts",
    "a lot of reporting coming in we'll check",
    "on it if there's discrepancies there",
    "we'll try to run those down",
    "next question is from spencer hickey at",

    "census uh statewide we've actually",
    "worked with our partners in the",
    "appalachian region",

    "um you know the the state has its entire",
    "uh complete count commission",
    "uh but there are complete count",
    "commissions uh all across",
    "the state as well in different counties",
    "and cities and",

    "ensure that we get those hard to count",
    "populations",
    "uh that you're referencing uh aware of",
    "the census",
    "and uh uh in terms of what that",

    "a",
    "a family member who maybe just moved",
    "they moved in from another state",
    "how does that person get contacted so",
    "the best thing uh for that individual to",
    "do is to either go online to",
    "2020census.gov",
    "or to call the phone number which is",
    "1-844-330-2020",

    "thank you well i i wish it was as simple",
    "as passing a law to",
    "get us away from the emergency that",
    "we're in i mean factually we are",
    "in an emergency whether it's declared or",
    "not",
    "we've declared it as an emergency but",
    "passing a law saying it's not an",
    "emergency is not going to make it not an",
    "emergency",
    "and i say that with all with all due",
    "respect to her she and i were",
    "talking the other day on a bill signing",
    "that she had sponsored",
    "uh so i have great deal of respect for",
    "her but look passing a bill just doesn't",
    "make it not an emergency we have an",
    "emergency",
    "we have significant spread um we have",
    "people dying",
    "and we can do this and",
    "you know we can do two things at once we",
    "can keep our economy going",
    "um we can go to our kids sporting events",
    "we can do a lot of different things but",
    "we still have to do",
    "some careful things in wearing a mask",
    "and keeping the social distance",
    "are very very necessary so",
    "no i certainly do not support that we",
    "have an emergency and",
    "when we're done with the emergency we'll",
    "we'll be done with emergency",
    "and i can't wait next question",
    "is from jackie borchardt at the",
    "cincinnati enquirer",
    "good afternoon governor as you mentioned",
    "earlier there is a",
    "a game tonight and many cincinnati",
    "bengals fans might be heading across the",
    "river to kentucky",
    "to watch the games since uh governor",
    "beshear pushed back its liquor curfew to",
    "11 p.m",
    "an extra hour compared to ohio ohio bar",
    "owners want to know will you follow suit",
    "and push back the curfew here",
    "i don't know yet i mean look we're going",
    "to consult",
    "people in different communities across",
    "the state of ohio",
    "as you know as i've reported before",
    "mayor cranley would like to see us",
    "do that but we have other mayors in",
    "major cities in the state who do not",
    "want us to do that",
    "feel that this has been a very helpful",
    "and slowing the spread down",
    "you know cincinnati is in a unique",
    "position because people can go across",
    "certainly can go across the river i just",
    "let me use this occasion also to say",
    "since we're talking about football and i",
    "plan on watching",
    "watching the game tonight",
    "should be a lot of fun but",
    "you know our concern really is as",
    "the nfl starts back up and now we'll",
    "have ohio state",
    "in the not too distant future you know a",
    "lot of us are going to be watching",
    "tv watching these games a lot of us like",
    "to do with friends and that's great a",
    "lot of us",
    "like to go into bars and watch it and",
    "that's fine too",
    "we just asked people you know when we",
    "talk about football the big question was",
    "is it safe",
    "you know i have a concern frankly about",
    "what this",
    "what results if a lot of people are",
    "getting together in bars",
    "and we saw some pictures the other day",
    "um",
    "you know the first weekend of football",
    "nfl and",
    "you know people were not distancing and",
    "so those are just by their nature",
    "dangerous and so we can enjoy the nfl",
    "uh the bengals and the browns and we can",
    "enjoy ohio state and we can enjoy",
    "uc and other other teams that are",
    "playing but",
    "we can do it we ought to try to do it in",
    "a safe way and that would be my",
    "my request if people could could do",
    "could do that",
    "next question is from justin dennis at",
    "mahoningmatters.com",
    "good afternoon governor i'd like to get",
    "back to nursing homes for",
    "a moment we heard from a group of",
    "ohioans who are pushing for",
    "some way to offer additional care or",
    "face time with their loved ones in",
    "nursing homes",
    "possibly by designating them as",
    "essential caregivers",
    "other states have enacted legislation to",
    "that effect which would allow those",
    "relatives inside nursing homes",
    "and to visit with their loved ones for",
    "for longer is there anything",
    "that you can share about the state's",
    "upcoming guidelines",
    "uh that might align with that and when",
    "can we expect to learn more about that",
    "plan",
    "yeah again i want to emphasize though",
    "the nursing homes",
    "for months uh have been permitted",
    "uh and we've given them guidance about",
    "allowing visitation",
    "and i know it's very frustrating that",
    "there are nursing homes they're not",
    "letting people visit or they're letting",
    "them visit for 15 minutes",
    "i mean unless they're really really busy",
    "seems to me more than 15 minutes should",
    "be allowed",
    "we want them to do it safely we don't",
    "want the virus coming in but they're",
    "doing it outside now they're doing",
    "people have face masks so i i just would",
    "say",
    "that unless the nursing home has coveted",
    "in there or some real reason not to",
    "have that the nursing home should be",
    "allowing people to visit",
    "they need to be careful we're now coming",
    "up with protocol",
    "uh which director mcelroy will be",
    "announcing shortly",
    "uh about how that will happen as it gets",
    "colder",
    "and you know visitation outside is",
    "obviously going to be difficult or",
    "impossible",
    "and how we'll be able to we hope",
    "carefully move that in",
    "in the long run in the long run the more",
    "testing we can get into nursing homes",
    "um the more we're going to be able to",
    "have visitation",
    "and the more we're going to have life",
    "that will be more normal",
    "for the people who the residents of the",
    "nursing homes and so we're working on",
    "that",
    "very very hard working on that this",
    "morning uh and we'll continue to",
    "to work on that so you know we're seeing",
    "more and more testing coming out we're",
    "seeing the cost go down",
    "you know and and the more testing that",
    "we can do",
    "uh inside nursing homes the safer it's",
    "it's going to be but we still",
    "as you know are losing a lot of people",
    "in nursing homes",
    "and it's just it's just you know breaks",
    "my heart",
    "and so we'd still have to be careful we",
    "can't just say",
    "we're not going to be careful so when",
    "people go into a nursing home to visit",
    "when we get to the point where they're",
    "physically going inside",
    "you know again it's going to even be",
    "more careful more important that they",
    "not",
    "have temperature that they not",
    "be positive at some point we're going to",
    "be able to get",
    "to the place where we in addition to the",
    "normal screenings that we have in",
    "in effect uh wearing masks and those",
    "other things",
    "that a test will be available at a",
    "reasonable cost and that person will",
    "take that test wait 15 minutes and if",
    "they pass that test",
    "they would be able to go into that into",
    "that nursing home",
    "now it's not 100 not perfect but that",
    "would be one more screening device",
    "added to the devices the things the mask",
    "and the other things that we already",
    "have so that's kind of",
    "where we're going in the future next",
    "question is from marty schlayton at the",
    "ohio capitol journal",
    "good afternoon governor marty",
    "um do you agree with former governors",
    "taft and celeste",
    "that ohio should pre-pay uh postage on",
    "absentee ballots",
    "and if you do agree what do you make of",
    "the controlling board's decision",
    "not to do so yeah i think i said last",
    "time um",
    "or at least i thought about maybe i",
    "didn't say it um",
    "that i'm in favor of that but i also say",
    "that we still have a good system in ohio",
    "without paying for that",
    "we do have a situation where you know",
    "everyone got",
    "the application that was mailed to them",
    "uh",
    "so you know ohio is aggressive secretary",
    "of state is aggressive uh",
    "i think you know we're doing a good job",
    "in ohio in letting people vote and",
    "trying to make it as broad as we can and",
    "giving them every opportunity but no i i",
    "would have",
    "i'm on the other side of that but it was",
    "it was clear to me",
    "some time ago that there simply was not",
    "an appetite in the general assembly to",
    "do that",
    "uh and in fact that they were members of",
    "the general assembly who did not favor",
    "doing that",
    "next question is from john reed at",
    "gongword news service",
    "good afternoon governor john um",
    "uh treasurer sprague suggested today",
    "spending 100 million dollars from the",
    "coronavirus relief fund on",
    "grants for small businesses to help them",
    "through that is that something",
    "you would support um and do you have any",
    "other ideas of",
    "how the rest of that money might be used",
    "yes i do uh we're working on that i",
    "intend to work further on this weekend",
    "i'm glad to get his recommendation i",
    "know that",
    "you know he was putting that out",
    "and we've received recommendations from",
    "other people",
    "talking with members of the legislature",
    "about this we should have",
    "recommendations to come out next week",
    "so we'll stay tuned we'll have more",
    "governor next question is the last",
    "question for today and it belongs to jim",
    "otte of whio in dayton",
    "governor let's return to football uh to",
    "what degree are you",
    "satisfied with the protocols to keep",
    "players coaches",
    "coaches and staff on the field safe",
    "and if you feel safe about that would",
    "you support",
    "returning fans to the stands let's say",
    "for example 6 000 fans at ohio stadium",
    "as will be at the game tonight",
    "jimmy talking about um we got three we",
    "got high school we got college we got",
    "uh nfl we're talking about all three",
    "what specific to college the big ten",
    "returning",
    "yeah are the protocols in in place",
    "yeah look i i think the protocols are in",
    "place at ohio state",
    "um i can only talk about ohio state but",
    "i i'm convinced the protocols",
    "are in place uh dr borchers",
    "uh who's advising the big ten uh is from",
    "ohio state",
    "i've talked to him on numerous occasions",
    "about you know",
    "how things are going at ohio state and",
    "testing the athletes not just the",
    "athletes for",
    "football but all the athletes i think",
    "they have a very very good protocol",
    "you know look as far as putting people",
    "in the stands",
    "that first is the decision of the big",
    "ten then a decision of ohio state",
    "there is no reason that we could not do",
    "something similar at ohio state to what",
    "we're doing with the bengals and the",
    "browns they both came forward with",
    "very good plans we basically divided the",
    "stadium up in four",
    "areas 1500 people per area which is what",
    "our maximum is for high school",
    "and so uh i'm you know convinced that",
    "that will work out",
    "very well i think it's going to work out",
    "very well tonight we'll turn on tv and",
    "watch",
    "but i think it's going to work out well",
    "with the browns and",
    "the bengals um again you know the real",
    "the real concern uh is now what happens",
    "inside that stadium with 6 000 people",
    "the concern is getting in",
    "getting out uh and what the what the",
    "congregating together i mean that's just",
    "what you",
    "you worry about from a purely from a",
    "health point of view",
    "uh is people you know congregating",
    "together in close proximity to each",
    "other",
    "uh i think what you're going to see",
    "tonight with the with the browns uh",
    "they're gonna have people spread out",
    "people are going to be wearing masks",
    "people are going to be safe they're",
    "going to be safe inside",
    "inside inside the stadium and so",
    "certainly we could expand that",
    "if ohio state wanted to we could expand",
    "something similar to that",
    "to to ohio state uh you know cleveland",
    "has done",
    "uh the right thing uh and the city has",
    "done the right thing",
    "you know doing everything they could to",
    "discourage tailgating everything they",
    "could",
    "discourage the congregation um you know",
    "we",
    "all love tailgating i love tailgating uh",
    "but",
    "you know this again this is a time when",
    "we're",
    "we're kind of shifting things off we're",
    "making some sacrifice here so we can do",
    "something else and",
    "being able to have the game be able to",
    "attend the game for some people",
    "uh and for the rest of us to watch it on",
    "tv and the players to be able to play",
    "uh you know that's those are all all all",
    "good things but",
    "um you know the congregating together is",
    "just something that's uh",
    "not not healthy",
    "jim thank you very much uh we look",
    "forward to seeing everyone",
    "uh on tuesday we hope you have a good",
    "weekend",
