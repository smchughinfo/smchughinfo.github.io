    "um noteworthy uh",
    "991 cases uh",
    "we are now at a 21 day average i think",
    "for the first time uh long long long",
    "time below a thousand",

    "going to have",
    "uh statistics uh data and",
    "some frankly makes us very optimistic",

    "to kind of lay this out",
    "uh for you for you today but again",
    "below a thousand for uh 21 day average",
    "just barely but we're there",
    "uh and we hope to conti those numbers",
    "continue to go down",
    "now let's take the next one look at the",
    "next one eric um",
    "this is all 88 counties ranked by",
    "highest occurrence",
    "again two really big things to look at",
    "uh as as you see how your county is",
    "doing one is the color",
    "coded maps that we have which takes in",
    "seven separate indicators the other one",
    "is",
    "is this which is one indicator and the",
    "one indicator is how many cases",
    "that county had new cases that county",
    "had in the last 14 days nothing beyond",
    "that but",
    "last 14 days how many cases they had",
    "and then it's",
    "modified for population so you're",
    "actually comparing apples",
    "to apples let's go to the second slide",
    "there which is the top ten",
    "and again we see a high number of these",
    "counties in in the western uh",
    "part of our state um we start",
    "with mercer uh putnam shelby",
    "athens of course the other other part",
    "pike county",
    "uh central uh ohio southern ohio",
    "lawrence county southern ohio",
    "miami dark wood butler",
    "all all in the west and the one from",
    "from there but again that's one of the",
    "one of the indicators to to take a look",
    "at let's go to our color code",
    "coded slides uh eric",
    "all right eric i've jumped ahead you",
    "want to go back i'm going to do the",
    "antibody",
    "let's do the antibody ones sorry about",
    "that it's my normal pattern",
    "when someone recovers some illness they",
    "typically",
    "develop antibodies which may make them",
    "less susceptible to contracting the",
    "illness again",
    "at least for a while and again this is",
    "what the scientists are studying in",
    "regard to covet",
    "you can measure these antibodies in a",
    "person's blood",
    "that's why one of the kind of",
    "interesting indicators",
    "is reported from the american red cross",
    "since june the american red cross has",
    "been testing all blood plasma",
    "and platelet donors for code with 19",
    "antibodies",
    "and they have been sharing this with us",
    "and the public this chart displays",
    "displays excuse me the weekly percentage",
    "of donors that had cobia 19 antibodies",
    "in their blood and compares ohio's",
    "levels",
    "with the us overall the antibody",
    "positivity for ohio donors has increased",
    "from",
    "1.2 percent in june uh to 3.3",
    "on september 14th uh this is fairly",
    "consistent",
    "uh with what we've seen with the",
    "national trend where the u.s rate is",
    "currently at 3.5",
    "just uh just some interesting uh data",
    "to take a look at we thought we would",
    "share that with you uh today",
    "now let's go to the alert system our",
    "color",
    "maps we have some changes this week we",
    "have nine red counties",
    "an increase of four from last week and",

    "the new red counties are ashland",
    "delaware pike",
    "sciota and stark staying red are butler",
    "mercer montgomery and putnam",
    "uh putnam dropped off i'm sorry",
    "portage county dropped off the red list",
    "which is good news 67 counties remained",
    "at the same level",
    "the greatest movement was nine counties",
    "moving from yellow",
    "to orange although we have seen lower",
    "case numbers in recent weeks as we just",
    "talked about a moment ago",
    "the distribution of cases continues just",
    "to spread out",
    "uh throughout the state uh with more and",
    "more cases",
    "in the rural parts of ohio interestingly",
    "the counties in ohio that border indiana",
    "kentucky and west virginia uh most of",
    "them are red or orange",
    "the number of high incident counties uh",
    "dropped from 21 last week to 20 this",
    "week not much of a change",
    "the population of ohioans living in",
    "yellow counties has",
    "decreased during the past four weeks",
    "indicating that we have significant",
    "spread of the virus again",
    "just more across the state let's look at",
    "some of the red",
    "counties mercer county is back on top of",
    "our county list for cases per capita",
    "this week",
    "with 257 cases per hundred thousand",
    "residents",
    "although there are small long-term care",
    "facility outbreaks in mercer county",
    "predominant issues are community spread",
    "and spread within families",
    "the local health department tells us",
    "we're also seeing a large some large",
    "events in the county which",
    "certainly can contribute to the spread",
    "let's go to putnam county they continue",
    "to meet the cdc's threshold for",
    "high incidents the county has added 81",
    "cases of covert during the past two",
    "weeks",
    "they have a total of 568 cases since it",
    "started just to put that in perspective",
    "but we're really focused on of course is",
    "the last two weeks",
    "local health department officials said",
    "they continue to see multiple people in",
    "the same family spreading the virus to",
    "each other",
    "schools are doing well most schools have",
    "modified their homecoming plans to only",
    "have a",
    "court and are not having parades or",
    "dances to help and of course all that is",
    "to help control the spread let's go to",
    "pike county they are red for the first",
    "time and they are high",
    "in the number of incidents per 100 000.",
    "pike county's cases more than doubled",
    "during the past",
    "week increasing from an average of one",
    "case per day",

    "phenomenal job",
    "we are also seeing that on our college",
    "campuses",
    "this summer in partnership with our",
    "colleges and universities",
    "we introduced the health department",
    "introduced guidance for reopening of",
    "ohio's colleges and universities in a",
    "safer way",
    "right now our colleges and universities",
    "have test",
    "processing partners in other words",
    "they're partnering with a lab a hospital",
    "um and they have plans in place that",
    "they have",
    "implemented so what we're going to be",
    "announcing in in a moment uh",
    "is an expansion of that",
    "that protocol and some of the colleges",
    "and universities are already doing",
    "what we are now uh recommending uh",
    "strongly recommending everybody do again",
    "let's look take a look and this is kind",
    "of random",
    "we've got a lot of colleges out there",
    "that are testing but let me just",
    "we're going to pick a few here because",
    "we've talked about them in the past",
    "a couple of them we've seen a lot of",
    "cases and i want to give you an",
    "update at the beginning of the semester",
    "the university of dayton tested all",
    "9 000 incoming students and out of that",
    "group they had a positivity of",
    "1.2 pretty much what you might expect",
    "after the kids came back to campus we",
    "saw some outbreaks",
    "and the school has worked tirelessly to",
    "limit that now last week the positivity",
    "rate was down it had been way up from",
    "there it was down to 2.2",
    "and there continue to work to drive it",
    "lower and think it's going to go",
    "lower so good work to the university of",
    "dayton",
    "at the end of august at miami university",
    "the positivity rate was over",
    "five percent and they were average",
    "in a hundred new positive cases a day",
    "uh this lee this week as they start back",
    "in in person",
    "um and i just maybe explain that a lot",
    "of the kids were already back",
    "physically they just had not moved into",
    "the dorms or they had not",
    "they were in residential housing that's",
    "outside the university",
    "so this week miami starts back",
    "last week they were moving into",
    "residence dorms last week as i recall",
    "and this week the same level of testing",
    "uh",
    "their positivity rates have gone from",
    "five percent",
    "uh down to one percent and so under one",
    "percent they're averaging less than 20",
    "new cases today",
    "they are testing students who live on",
    "and off campus and are casting a wide",
    "net on testing those who live in",
    "congregate settings where someone has",
    "tested positive",
    "so we again congratulate the officials",
    "at miami university one of our smaller",
    "schools",
    "college of wooster they are",
    "predominantly",
    "residential when students arrived on",
    "campus seven of their 1588 students",
    "were positive that's a low positivity",
    "rate of",
    "0.4 less than 1 percent",
    "the college is working with the wayne",
    "county health department advi and",
    "advisors from the wexner medical center",
    "and focusing on prevention and screening",
    "this past week they tested 13 percent of",
    "their on-campus students",
    "and they have a positivity rate uh after",
    "having come back still",
    "at one half of one percent so this is",
    "uh very very good news not much change",
    "at all now ohio state",
    "beginning of september the positivity",
    "rate was nearly six percent",
    "and the school was averaging 150",
    "positive tests each day",
    "this week with the same level of testing",
    "they're finding finding",
    "a positivity rate around two percent",
    "so from six to two they're averaging",
    "less than 70 new cases each day",
    "testing has allowed them to isolate",
    "positive cases effectively",
    "conduct contact tracing and reduce the",
    "spread",
    "so again let me just say those are just",
    "some schools that we had",
    "talked about in the past i want to give",
    "you an update on them we have other",
    "schools that are doing testing",
    "and doing a very very good job",
    "so let me let me talk a little bit more",
    "about what our",
    "changes in guidance is while some",
    "schools are already doing this today",
    "we're announcing a recommendation that",
    "all our residential colleges and",
    "universities",
    "uh ensure that they're regularly testing",
    "a sample population",
    "of their students so in other words we",
    "want to make sure that they're testing",
    "students who do not have",
    "symptoms so a random sample of",
    "their students we're leaving it up to",
    "them",
    "as to what population to test",
    "every week but we recommended a minimum",
    "a minimum three three percent",
    "uh screening uh students who do not have",
    "symptoms really gives college presidents",
    "uh and their team a real look at what's",
    "happening on their campus",
    "campuses don't exist in a bubble every",
    "single one of our",
    "campuses most of them at least are close",
    "to a",
    "population center some small villages",
    "and some",
    "cities but they students go back and",
    "forth",
    "they do intermingle and so they are part",
    "of of a community",
    "um it's important that we continue to",
    "know",
    "uh and that the universities continue to",
    "know what is going on",
    "uh on their campuses it's important for",
    "them to know what's going on with their",
    "students who don't live",
    "on on campus and so this is our",
    "recommendation we're going to put a",
    "more formal guidance out uh in the next",
    "several days",
    "so again our expectation is each campus",
    "will plan to screen at least three",
    "percent of their at-risk uh",
    "of their at three percent of their",
    "population uh",
    "and to do that uh every week again",
    "work with the local health department",
    "what they're finding will dictate how",
    "much",
    "testing that that they have to do",
    "we look forward to continuing to work",
    "with our colleges and universities",
    "uh as we as we move forward",
    "i think we have some good news uh john",
    "houston will have some good news later",
    "on",
    "uh i'm gonna uh give you a little good",
    "news actually i'm going to",
    "let our uh director of aging",
    "uh marcel mcelroy uh give member of our",
    "cabinet give you that good news but",
    "as a kind of a lead in before we get her",
    "cell on here",
    "throughout the pandemic older ohioans",
    "have certainly been particularly hard",
    "hit",
    "seniors who live in a congregate setting",
    "are susceptible to the spread of the",
    "virus",
    "probably more so than others at the",
    "beginning our nursing home facilities",
    "and assisted living facilities were",
    "closed to visitors",
    "and we did that uh right early on",
    "uh to protect the residents um",
    "and to protect uh them and and the",
    "people who worked there the best that we",
    "could",
    "we know however that this was hard and",
    "it was hard for",
    "the residents of nursing homes residents",
    "of assisted living",
    "and it's hard for their families and so",
    "on june 8th",
    "outdoor visits have been permitted",
    "assisted living facilities so long as",
    "all safety standards are met",
    "those same type visits we started",
    "allowing",
    "at nursing homes on july 20th so since",
    "since june for the assisted living and",
    "since july for nursing homes",
    "outdoor visitation has been allowed and",
    "again i know i continue to get",
    "get calls about this and i know the",
    "lieutenant",
    "governor does as well and director",
    "mcelroy does",
    "uh but outdoor visitation has been open",
    "since june",
    "and july we leave it up to the nursing",
    "homes",
    "uh to set how that's going to to occur",
    "so if you're not getting that visitation",
    "now",
    "you need to talk directly to your",
    "nursing home or or to your assisted",
    "living they may have a good reason for",
    "doing it",
    "but you should talk directly directly to",
    "them",
    "about that but we know as",
    "it's a beautiful day",
    "out today but we know it's going to get",
    "cold",
    "it won't be that long and we know that",
    "outdoor visitation will no longer work",
    "so we have been working on coming up",
    "with",
    "indoor visitation and director mcelroy",
    "i'm going to",
    "call on you now i see you on the screen",
    "and if you can",
    "tell everyone what what what our plans",
    "are as we as we move forward",
    "and i think i think it's good news i",
    "think people will be happy with it and",
    "it's being done in a",
    "i think a very uh a very responsible way",
    "and the",
    "director has been working on this i know",
    "very hard director",
    "thank you and good afternoon governor",
    "always good to see you",
    "and talk with you so along with",
    "thousands of nursing home and assisted",
    "living residents and their families and",
    "we've been waiting for this day",
    "so you're right i do believe this is",
    "really good news for the residents",
    "families and advocates we certainly feel",
    "you're saying jubilation about this",
    "for the staff of the facilities we join",
    "your feelings of happiness for your",
    "residents",
    "and we also join your feelings of",
    "concern about the health risks for these",
    "same residents",
    "risks that we know haven't changed and",
    "risks that won't change until this",
    "coronavirus emergency has passed us",
    "i also want to take a moment to",
    "acknowledge the strain that has been",
    "felt by residents and by their families",
    "and to also acknowledge the strain that",
    "has been felt by the staff",
    "staff who care deeply and wish for",
    "reconnection of the residents and",
    "families",
    "because they know how very important",
    "regular connections are to physical",
    "health and mental well-being",
    "and for the families who have lost their",
    "loved ones when there were restrictions",
    "in visitation",
    "we sadly and humbly acknowledge your",
    "grief and we wish",
    "like all of you that things were",
    "different as the governor has mentioned",
    "we have talked with",
    "countless families we've heard we fell",
    "in stat",
    "fact we still feel the heartbreak",
    "and i can allow for that our hearts are",
    "all with you",
    "so with the expansions of visitation now",
    "into indoor",
    "i want to talk a bit about how we got",
    "here",
    "and what that's going to look like as",
    "the governor mentioned those",
    "prolonged loss of connections are",
    "critical",
    "we've heard from families residents",
    "advocates and we've consulted with many",
    "aging professionals public health",
    "experts and industry representatives",
    "and i'd like to give a particular call",
    "out to the academy for senior health",
    "sciences",
    "leading age ohio the ohio assisted",
    "living association",
    "the ohio health care association and the",
    "ohio medical directors association",
    "for working alongside us we also",
    "are moving in a direction we are aligned",
    "with our federal partners",
    "in particular the centers for medicare",
    "medicaid services",
    "and as the governor pointed out the",
    "weather we know that the days are",
    "getting cooler and are getting cooler",
    "pretty fast",
    "so governor you often remind us that we",
    "can do two things at once and this is",
    "certainly true as it relates to our next",
    "phase of visitation",
    "it's important for everyone to know that",
    "indoor visitation does not",
    "signal that we can be less cautious",
    "what it means is that each of us",
    "residents families and staff need to be",
    "even more vigilant in practicing the",
    "very basic",
    "yet very critical practices that limit",
    "the spread of this virus",
    "wash your hands wear a mask keep your",
    "distance limit your visiting time and",
    "most of all",
    "stay home if you think that you've been",
    "exposed or",
    "feeling ill on top of covet 19 we're",
    "also going into flu season",
    "so we want every resident to be as",
    "strong and as healthy as",
    "possible and remember when you enter one",
    "of these facilities",
    "you are entering someone's home and to",
    "that point for families who are visiting",
    "always remember that you are walking",
    "into the home of not only your loved one",
    "but into the home of their friends and",
    "others so in addition to the basics of",
    "mask and hand washing",
    "also stay tuned into the level of spread",
    "happening",
    "in your home area if it is high that",
    "means that your risk of exposure is also",
    "higher if you've been out",
    "it is so important that we all do our",
    "part",
    "when you walk into a nursing home or an",
    "assisted living facility",
    "all of us can unknowingly be carrying",
    "the virus",
    "and unknowingly spread its residents and",
    "staff and their respective families",
    "so what can you expect with this indoor",
    "visitation",
    "i want to first remind you that this is",
    "a first step of others to come",
    "as we responsibly restart our indoor",
    "faces",
    "so first the facility has to determine",
    "its level of readiness to facilitate",
    "indoor visitation safely so they have to",
    "one consider the case status in that",
    "surrounding community",
    "so they have to examine community",
    "transmission is it low medium or high",
    "two they have to consider the case",
    "status within their facility",
    "are there covet cases in the building",
    "three staffing levels do they have",
    "adequate levels to care for residents",
    "and safely facilitate the visits",
    "four do they have access to adequate",
    "testing for residents and staff in other",
    "words are they compliant with the",
    "testing guidelines that apply to their",
    "respective settings",
    "five personal protective equipment",
    "supplies do they have the mass",
    "shields gloves necessary",
    "and do they have local hospital capacity",
    "in other words should their facility",
    "have an outbreak",
    "does their community have the resources",
    "to manage it or do they have alternative",
    "arrangements",
    "in place there are some things that are",
    "expected at a minimum for all of the",
    "facilities",
    "one they have to limit entry to",
    "personnel who are necessary for the",
    "operations of the facilities",
    "so that's going to look like your health",
    "care providers",
    "your governmental representatives and",
    "regulators",
    "but it also includes hospice personnel",
    "who provide core services",
    "clergy and hair stylist they have to",
    "screen all staff and visitors upon",
    "entering the facility",
    "they have to maintain a daily log of",
    "individuals that enter the building",
    "the visits must be scheduled in advance",
    "they must occur in designated visitation",
    "areas",
    "they will be allotted 30 minutes maximum",
    "and this makes it possible to have a",
    "meaningful interaction",
    "but it also allows more families time to",
    "visit",
    "and it gives the facilities time in",
    "between each visit to sanitize spaces",
    "two visitors are permitted per resident",
    "per visit",
    "and while there is no set age for the",
    "visitor",
    "you must be able to social distance and",
    "wear face covering",
    "it's important to note that all visitors",
    "will be required to wear a mask",
    "supplied by the facility",
    "in addition to regular visits visitation",
    "will also be permitted in compassionate",
    "care situations",
    "so this is not reserved for end-of-life",
    "situations only",
    "but on occasions where compassionate",
    "interaction is vital to the quality and",
    "preservation of life",
    "so a few examples would be maybe a",
    "resident who is grieving",
    "after a loved one passed away or perhaps",
    "there's an individual who needs",
    "cueing and encouragement with eating or",
    "drinking or they may be experiencing",
    "weight loss or dehydration",
    "or perhaps you have a resident who used",
    "to talk",
    "interact with others but is experiencing",
    "emotional distress",
    "seldom speaking or crying more",
    "frequently",
    "we also are going to permit communal",
    "activities with safety protocols and",
    "distancing",
    "so being able to eat together being able",
    "to participate in activities together",
    "but in a safe manner the facilities will",
    "have to develop a written and",
    "transparent plan with these new",
    "requirements",
    "so that families and residents are fully",
    "informed and have an appreciation of",
    "what to expect upon arrival",
    "and it is our expectation that",
    "facilities will not restrict visitation",
    "without a reasonable clinical or safety",
    "cost",
    "the other piece that's really exciting",
    "is that the facilities will also",
    "regularly report",
    "visitation information to the state via",
    "an online dashboard",
    "that will be accessible at",
    "www.coronavirus.gov",
    "and it will be launched when indoor",
    "visitation begins and this dashboard",
    "will be",
    "very important in helping family members",
    "understand and make decisions around",
    "visitation",
    "so with a few easy clicks you'll see the",
    "status of outdoor and indoor visitation",
    "maximum hours for a visit maximum number",
    "of visitors",
    "and contact information for the facility",
    "so at this point i want to close",
    "governor",
    "but i want to close by restating what",
    "we've already said",
    "and that this moment in time albeit a",

    "disabilities",
    "um during the pandemic we've had limited",
    "visitation",
    "at the intermediate care facilities",
    "for our fellow citizens these are",
    "licensed",
    "facilities where individuals living with",
    "developmental disabilities",
    "can live and do live they vary in size",
    "some as small as four residents some",
    "with over a hundred",
    "residents these facilities and direct",
    "service providers have worked hard to",
    "keep residents safe",
    "during the last seven months like",
    "nursing facilities",
    "uh we've limited visits for family and",
    "friends",
    "uh only to outdoor visitation that's",
    "what it's been so far",
    "we know this has been hard for residents",
    "we know it was",
    "hard for loved ones quarter months are",
    "coming",
    "uh it's now time to update that guidance",
    "so director",
    "director davis you want to talk to us a",
    "little bit and tell us what we're doing",
    "here",
    "i do governor thank you so much for",
    "having me",
    "so i appreciate the comments of director",
    "mcelroy are you and director mcelroy i",
    "think that",
    "you summarized there's a lot of",
    "similarities",
    "between the approach visitation and",
    "skilled nursing and our approach",
    "with our intermediate care facilities",
    "but it is has been a journey",
    "and if we can chat about that just a",
    "touch you know we started with that stay",
    "at home",
    "and we did that out of a sense of health",
    "and safety we all did",
    "and we asked a lot of patients out of",
    "our families",
    "and friends and individuals and and they",
    "did and they understood",
    "as we tried with priority to keep people",
    "safe and healthy but we also understand",
    "and director mcelroy said",
    "this so well over time is that that",
    "that human contact is so very important",
    "and so essential",
    "and yes we've tried to do that by",
    "computer and we've done it ultimately by",
    "outside visitation",
    "uh and it's been successful but we know",
    "on the part of the individuals that we",
    "support and certainly families again as",
    "friends",
    "that that that actual intimacy you know",
    "of being together",
    "matters so very much and so this is just",
    "that next natural step",
    "we're i think all of us are trying to",
    "find some sense of normal",
    "in a virus environment that's not normal",
    "and this is just that next step of",
    "finding a little bit of normalcy",
    "and getting people together so we are",
    "you know we are very pleased we",
    "appreciate",
    "we appreciate governor your efforts in",
    "working with us and director mcilroy as",
    "we work together",
    "so we've got that kind of structure and",
    "beginning on monday",
    "actually the 28th of september we will",
    "have",
    "indoor visitation it will be structured",
    "in many of the same ways that director",
    "mcelroy talked about",
    "so we asked continued patients of",
    "families you know and friends so we'll",
    "do that",
    "we have a lot of as you mentioned",
    "governor we have so many",
    "different types of settings in our",
    "intermediate care facilities so in some",
    "cases it will be",
    "separate buildings in some cases it will",
    "be very isolated settings",
    "you know within an overall residential",
    "building",
    "but in some cases we have four people",
    "living together",
    "and so there's not separate buildings",
    "and we'll have to ask",
    "you know we'll have to ask patients uh",
    "with everyone as we set aside",
    "you know a spot you know in that home so",
    "that",
    "we can sort of isolate in that",
    "visitation and we take the very same",
    "precautions that director mcelroy talked",
    "about but",
    "but we are happy because we know it's",
    "been so very hard we know this is a",
    "human right we are a human system",
    "and it matters so very much uh to those",
    "that we support and their families to be",
    "together where we can so",
    "we ask patients and understanding as we",
    "take this next step",
    "as we do try and do it as safely as",
    "possible but we of course are",
    "are very appreciative that we can do it",
    "director thank you very much uh i know",
    "that's good news for families good news",
    "for residents",
    "um and thank you for all you do to take",
    "care of them protect them",

    "their lives which is what",
    "really the goal of your department is so",
    "thank you very very much",
    "appreciate it let me go to",
    "something that i know is a huge problem",
    "and we can't solve every problem and",
    "but we can work on it uh and that is",
    "something that",
    "people tell me every day",
    "and that is the mental health problems",
    "that go",
    "with this pandemic um",
    "we see it with young people you see with",
    "older people um",
    "presents this virus",
    "besides all the other things that's",
    "caused",
    "has caused some real mental health",

    "we're going to get additional funds",
    "we'll be able to announce this",
    "we hope early next week additional funds",
    "for our k-12 schools they already",
    "are receiving wellness funds and",
    "i've seen what some of the schools have",

    "our",
    "k-12 kids uh has gone up",
    "same with our colleges and universities",
    "i had the opportunity yesterday to",
    "be on a couple of conference calls with",

    "on my heart and i know it does the",
    "members of the general assembly",
    "the senate president speaker and and",
    "everyone else",
    "and so we're going to continue to to",

    "the next presidential debate the first",
    "one",
    "this year uh it's tuesday in cleveland",
    "and ohio is uh very happy to be hosting",
    "this",
    "last night cleveland officials sent a",
    "formal request for us to make available",
    "the ohio national guard",
    "and we are we are granting that uh in",
    "the past",
    "when we've been asked for help by any of",
    "our cities",
    "we have been able to supply the national",
    "guard",
    "they are there to do a they do a great",
    "job",
    "basically as backup",
    "but it's important so we thank the guard",
    "men and women of the guard who will be",
    "deployed there",
    "we've talked in the past a lot about",
    "a police reform bill that we have",
    "pending",
    "in the legislature we've been talking a",
    "lot with legislators about uh",
    "police reform representing phil plummer",
    "for example and um that is something",
    "that we hope that the legislature will",
    "take up maybe in the lame duck session",
    "but what i want to talk to about today",
    "is something that we've been able to do",
    "without",
    "changing the law in ohio without",
    "legislative passage or anything",
    "and that is i previously announced our",
    "new ohio office of law enforcement",
    "recruitment",
    "in june i announced the creation of this",
    "office as part of our overall work to",
    "improve the relationship between ohio's",
    "law enforcement officers",
    "and our citizens the goal of the ohio",
    "office of law enforcement recruitment",
    "is to support local law enforcement",
    "agencies to not only recruit more",
    "diverse officers",
    "but also to recruit the right officers",
    "we have close to a thousand police",
    "departments in the state",
    "law enforcement agencies in the state if",
    "you count the sheriffs and",
    "the local police departments township",
    "police departments so a lot of different",
    "law enforcement departments and one of",
    "our goals is to constantly help each one",
    "of them",
    "to improve with training and to help",
    "each one of them",
    "with recruitment so",
    "i'm happy to announce today that sarah",
    "shendi has come on board with us to",
    "serve as the director",
    "of the ohio office of law enforcement",
    "recruitment",
    "she was one of our law enforcement",
    "training officers at the ohio police",
    "officer training academy which is when i",
    "first got to know her",
    "when i was the the attorney general she",
    "is also an officer for the copley",

    "hi governor i'm here thank you welcome",
    "good afternoon tell us a little bit uh",
    "quickly about your background",
    "and how you got to this to this point",
    "and then maybe tell us a little bit",
    "about the office we're really just",
    "kind of getting it rolling and thank you",
    "for being willing to",
    "to take this assignment on um",
    "thank you for having me and thank you",
    "for bringing me on",
    "i feel very honored and privileged to",
    "work with the people that i'm currently",
    "working with right now",
    "um at the office of law enforcement",
    "recruitment a little bit about my",
    "background",
    "as you know i'm a middle eastern muslim",
    "female",
    "coming into law enforcement was quite a",
    "journey",
    "um not the easiest one but not the",
    "hardest one",
    "i shared with you on an earlier phone",
    "call that when i decided to go to the",
    "police academy after i graduated from",
    "kent state",
    "that i didn't even tell my family and",
    "when i did tell my family i didn't tell",
    "my dad",
    "and luckily he wasn't even in the",
    "country when i graduated from the police",
    "academy so that was good",
    "um i value education and training so i",
    "do have my bachelor's and master's in",
    "criminal justice",
    "prior to coming into law enforcement i",
    "worked in",
    "mental health for portage county and i",
    "also worked in corrections for academic",
    "county",
    "and um this this job is my",
    "absolute passion i tell every single",
    "person i meet that this is the best job",
    "on the planet",
    "and every day i'm truly thankful to be",
    "in uniform um",
    "it's funny because when i was at oppada",
    "i was there for almost four years",
    "i had a really hard time adjusting not",
    "being in uniform every day",
    "and i always remind myself that the",
    "effect that we have on others",
    "as human beings is the most valuable",
    "currency there is",
    "and i always reminded the officers that",
    "came through the building alpada and",
    "officers that i see now",
    "that every single day we're in uniform",
    "we have the potential of changing",
    "someone's life and if we can't change",
    "their life completely",
    "we can make it a little bit better when",
    "we get sent to their house on the worst",
    "day of their life",
    "i'm excited about the office of law",
    "enforcement recruitment we have a lot of",
    "projects going on",
    "some of them include getting together",
    "with",
    "agencies so every police department",
    "that's hiring in the state of ohio",
    "can let us know and we can put those job",
    "openings on our website because that's",
    "something that currently does not exist",
    "and it does make the hiring and the",
    "application process a lot",
    "harder for potential recruits we're also",
    "having a mentorship program because",
    "having",
    "support while you're going through the",
    "academy is extremely important",
    "and especially when it comes to women",
    "and minorities",
    "you know someone from an indian",
    "community or a middle eastern community",
    "or a jewish community",
    "might want to go to the police academy",
    "but they might be afraid of the",
    "backlash if you would from the community",
    "because of the cultural expectations",
    "and we want to offer them the support",
    "that's necessary to successfully",
    "complete the academy",
    "because once you decide to become a",
    "police officer it is a life-altering",
    "decision",
    "and one that we want to support uh some",
    "other things that we're working on",
    "currently uh in terms of prioritizing",
    "our list is we are working on a website",
    "and that website is going to enable the",
    "public as well as police departments to",
    "get in touch with",
    "me and my team members and we are there",
    "to answer any questions we're going to",
    "have a frequently asked questions page",
    "and we're really going to try to educate",
    "the public on",
    "law enforcement duties in the state of",
    "ohio because",
    "i really believe that the average",
    "citizen does not know what we do as",
    "police officers they think that the",
    "majority of our job",
    "is traffic stops and handling accidents",
    "and usually i joke around and tell them",
    "no that's the troopers but for local law",
    "enforcement",
    "uh statistically speaking only 20",
    "percent of our job is self-initiative",
    "activity",
    "and about 80 of our job we basically",
    "respond to calls",
    "and act as mediators and peacekeepers so",
    "the one other thing that i'm really",
    "excited about is we plan to have videos",
    "up on the website and we're going to",
    "interview officers",
    "from around the state from very",
    "different backgrounds",
    "about their journey into law enforcement",
    "how they became a police officer",
    "and why they decided to stay as well as",
    "some of the",
    "uh challenges that they may have",
    "encountered",
    "well thank you very much and and yeah i",
    "think what we'll do",
    "in the next few months every every month",
    "or so we'll kind of bring you back",
    "and you can kind of tell us what what's",
    "going on there a lot more questions that",
    "i i would like to ask you",
    "but uh we we probably need to to move on",
    "here but",
    "thank you for taking the job thank you",
    "for doing it uh this is an important",
    "mission pleasure",
    "very you know it's very very important",
    "what what you're doing so",
    "thank you very much appreciate thank you",
    "sir thank you",
    "lieutenant governor",
    "thank you governor uh i'm gonna i know",
    "we're uh short on time so i'm gonna try",
    "to plow through these things uh",
    "i'll stop i'll start first with the",
    "sports order update",
    "uh starting back in may we",
    "began to return to play first with",
    "skill sessions then scrimmages and then",
    "competition",
    "about four weeks ago we",
    "had a complete return to play in the",
    "sense that all",
    "uh schools are were back in action",
    "uh all sports were back in action um",
    "that might mean contact non-contact",
    "sports all of them",
    "even though 17 states did not have",
    "football and",
    "including the district of columbia uh we",
    "have been successful",
    "with the protocols that been put in",
    "place uh at operating sports and",
    "and being able to do so while minimizing",
    "the spread of the virus",
    "and as we've done throughout we're",
    "trying to incrementally",
    "get back into things as we learn",
    "from these experiences we begin to",
    "expand opportunities",
    "and one provision we had in place is",
    "that we were limiting competition",
    "to one team per calendar day however",
    "we're now going to remove that",
    "prohibition",
    "to eliminate to one team meaning for",
    "example if you were a soccer team",
    "playing in a tournament you might play",
    "one game on saturday now and then have",
    "to come back and play the next game on",
    "sunday",
    "we would allow you to play both of those",
    "games in a single calendar day um and uh",
    "that prohibition uh will be",
    "removed in the new order however what we",
    "will be adding",
    "is something that we know works which is",
    "to make sure that everybody's following",
    "the protocols",
    "uh and uh we're adding a provision that",
    "will require",
    "each sports venue uh to cooperate with",
    "the local inspectors who are",
    "who are in charge of making sure",
    "that these uh that there's compliance uh",
    "that these inspectors will",
    "be able to have the authority to",
    "terminate the competition if they're not",
    "following",
    "the spectator and participant rules so",
    "we're loosening up the opportunity or",
    "adding opportunity but we're also going",
    "to make sure that we follow the rules",
    "so that we can continue to maintain",
    "these",
    "events in a healthy and successful",
    "manner",
    "two other things i want to touch about",
    "touch on briefly a little good news",
    "about innovate ohio as you know we",
    "uh we want to use technology to improve",
    "the way we serve our customers",
    "you signed governor an executive order",
    "last year requiring",
    "our agencies to migrate their data to",
    "the innovate ohio platform",
    "fortunately the department of health was",
    "one of the first ones",
    "to do that and",
    "that enabled us to",
    "do a lot of great things on with their",
    "data",
    "and this caught the attention of the",
    "caught national attention",
    "from the center for digital government",
    "which is a national research and",
    "advisory institute",
    "focused on technology policy and the",
    "innovate ohio platform and",
    "partnership with the department of",
    "health today was recognized with the",
    "government",
    "experience award for their coven 19",
    "response and",
    "that ranges everything from dashboards",
    "that we use to update people",
    "uh and get that data out there as fast",
    "as we can",
    "deploying digital forms for ppe and",
    "data exchange with local health",
    "departments",
    "leveraging people's digital identity at",
    "the local level to",
    "rapidly grant cities and health",
    "departments access to customize",
    "data and and to reduce the time the",
    "local healthcare workers",
    "have to spend on these follow-ups those",
    "are just a few things",
    "that enable us to do it shows how if you",
    "do this right you get technology",
    "in the right places we can improve",
    "customer service i also want to be clear",
    "this does not mean that our work is done",
    "uh this is only the beginning",
    "um but um i hope that others will see",
    "particularly other agencies that when",
    "you do this",
    "like we saw with the bmv uh like we're",
    "seeing with the department of health",
    "that when we do these things that we can",
    "really improve the way we're serving our",
    "customers and",
    "and also by the way improved data",
    "security that's a",
    "essential part of this you improve data",
    "security when you get this done",
    "and then finally an announcement on the",

    "is from",
    "laura bischoff at the dayton daily news",
    "hi governor so president trump has",
    "indicated that he may not accept the",
    "election results or a peaceful transfer",
    "of power",
    "um what do you say to that and and",
    "what's your response to",
    "efforts to undermine the confidence in",
    "the election process",
    "one of the things that we have done",
    "throughout our history",
    "well uh is the transfer of power",
    "in an election sometimes it's an",
    "incumbent president and",
    "he's reelected and that person is",
    "reelected",
    "sometimes it's an open seat sometimes it",
    "is",
    "you know a situation where the incumbent",
    "loses uh but whatever the situation",
    "however hotly contested",
    "these races have been um however",
    "riled up everybody is on each side and",
    "as we've had those throughout our",
    "history",
    "um when the results are in",
    "people accept it uh",
    "i'm reminded of a of a book and i don't",
    "have the quote in front of me but",
    "when i was in in i guess in junior high",
    "i read a book called the making of the",
    "president 1960.",
    "um and my actually my grandmother gave",
    "me the book",
    "and if you just look and read nothing",
    "more than the first two",
    "pages it's almost in",
    "theater white almost in poetry not prose",
    "it talks about what makes us unique",
    "and uh why we have been able to do this",
    "for so long and part of what makes us",
    "different is this historically now we",
    "got more countries that can do it today",
    "but historically",
    "what's made us different from the",
    "beginning is we have a peaceful transfer",
    "of power",
    "and the winner wins the loser loses",
    "sometimes as in uh 2000",
    "uh you know obviously that ended up in",
    "the supreme court",
    "but uh the loser albert gore",
    "didn't agree with it he accepted it",
    "um the first presidential race that i i",
    "watched as a kid was kennedy and nixon",
    "my my future wife was her kennedy and uh",
    "i was for nixon um",
    "but despite a tough tough battle",
    "uh there were people who",
    "told nixon well the election has been",
    "stolen from you",
    "they've cheated you in chicago",
    "and he made the decision that not to",
    "contest it",
    "he made the decision to accept what the",
    "results",
    "were now everything is fact specific and",
    "you have to look at what",
    "uh you know there may be a time when one",
    "candidate says look we need a recount",
    "here recount there",
    "all within the confines of the law and",
    "that's that is fine people have the",
    "right to continue to",
    "to battle but in the end in the end",
    "uh we will have a present uh and",
    "it's going to be you know the incumbent",
    "or the challenger",
    "it's going to be joe biden or it's going",
    "to be donald trump",
    "and those of us who if we win",
    "we'll be happy if we lose we lose",
    "but those who lose will accept it",
    "because that's what we do in america",
    "government governor can i add something",
    "about the elections",
    "um i just want to reiterate to folks and",
    "remind them that ohio has a history of",
    "running",
    "great elections uh and we have a great",
    "bipartisan system in our state we have",
    "88 county boards of elections because",
    "the law",
    "the the the elections are run by the",
    "local boards of elections the",
    "the ballots are tabulated there they are",
    "they are they are cast locally and",
    "counted locally",
    "and in those 88 county boards there is a",
    "director and a deputy director",
    "of that board of elections one is a",
    "republican and one is a democrat",
    "and whoever the director is of one party",
    "the board of that party because there",
    "are four people on the board the board",
    "is of the other party so it is there is",
    "a check and balance",
    "at our local boards of elections where",
    "democrats and republicans look over each",
    "other's shoulder hold each other",
    "accountable",
    "and we have a strong tradition just as",
    "the governor talked about a peaceful",
    "transition to power",
    "we have a strong tradition in ohio of of",
    "running good bipartisan fair",
    "elections and and i'm confident that",
    "that will happen this year as well",
    "that's from the former secretary",
    "secretary of state",
    "um look i'm trained as a lawyer and i",
    "kind of like the adversarial system",
    "and i look at the election how their run",
    "is",
    "in in that sense there's a member at the",
    "precinct level",
    "at the county level of each party uh",
    "members of each party are represented",
    "and",
    "we run elections and and we do it well",
    "in ohio",
    "we'll go back to uh john london at wlwt",
    "in cincinnati",
    "i think you can hear me now uh some",
    "school districts",
    "thank you some school districts have a",
    "single digit positive cases",
    "resulting in triple digit quarantines",
    "currently one down in this area there",
    "are eight positives and 184",
    "in quarantine leaving students who feel",
    "fine and exhibit no symptoms",
    "unable to be in class for 14 days and",
    "i'm wondering what adjustments",
    "you might be willing to consider such as",
    "maybe reducing quarantine time the cdc",
    "standard as i understand it as 10 days",
    "or having",
    "quarantined students tested right away",
    "and maybe be allowed to return to the",
    "classroom setting immediately",
    "or in three or five days let's say if",
    "the result is negative",
    "yeah john i've asked our team to take a",
    "look at that um you know",
    "these are really not my decisions these",
    "are local health departments decisions",
    "state department of health and their",
    "their",
    "guidance is based on the best medical",
    "information they can have",
    "uh what i do know is that uh in in some",
    "schools",
    "uh because they get the specific facts",
    "um",
    "and people have come forward they've",
    "been able to narrow that down we would",
    "obviously want this narrowed as much as",
    "possible we don't want kids out of",
    "school",
    "we don't want them uh having to be",
    "quarantined at all so we're going to",
    "continue to",
    "to look at that but what i'm going to do",
    "is rely on the best medical advice we",
    "get",
    "you know we we went into this with the",
    "idea",
    "uh that people said look we want to go",
    "to school",
    "and it has been i think a success",
    "um yes there's been some glitches here",
    "and there undoubtedly there",
    "always is but but parents have done a",
    "good job",
    "students have done a phenomenal job uh",
    "and",
    "and teachers and principals have done a",
    "great great job they work with their",
    "local health department",
    "so we're always open to look and see or",
    "you know is this right",
    "or we got it adjusted correctly but the",
    "whole idea is",
    "you know we've got stay on this virus",
    "if the community has widespread or",
    "whatever the community has",
    "that's going to be reflected in the",
    "school",
    "and when kids are exposed then they we",
    "have to deal deal with that",
    "so the whole idea is what we're doing",
    "with our health orders and our health",
    "guidance is to keep our schools open",
    "um but we're we certainly will continue",
    "to look at that",
    "and adjust that if we think that the",
    "best medical information",
    "is evolving and it's different and i've",
    "i've had some exchanges some very uh",
    "delightful exchanges with some",
    "superintendents uh who've kind of taken",
    "issue with where we are",
    "i've told our team to take a look at",
    "that they've made some interesting",
    "points",
    "um but what we want to do is is it we're",
    "in this for the long run",
    "we don't know when we're going to have",
    "the vaccine and we don't know when",
    "everybody's going to be have",
    "vaccine available so we've got to look",
    "at this not just",
    "for before christmas but after christmas",
    "and how do we keep as many kids in",
    "school as we can",
    "and that's ultimately what what the goal",
    "is",
    "next question is from jim province at",
    "the toledo blade",
    "good afternoon governor hey jim hi the",
    "ohio senate yesterday passed senate bill",
    "311 to prevent ohio governors from",
    "issuing quarantine orders affecting",
    "anyone who's not already diagnosed with",
    "or known to have been in contact with",
    "someone with an infectious disease",
    "the bill's sponsor said you'd never have",
    "the authority to impose such quarantines",
    "in the first place",
    "um what is your reaction to this and",
    "will you veto this bill if it gets to",
    "your desk",
    "well the people who voted for this bill",
    "the members of the senator",
    "are my friends they think that they're",
    "doing the right thing with the vote",
    "so we start with that",
    "but this bill cannot become law",
    "uh it would",
    "make it impossible for a future governor",
    "future health departments",
    "um to deal with whatever the emerging",
    "crisis is",
    "and more importantly it would not be in",
    "the",
    "best interest of ohioans as far as their",
    "health let me give you a couple of",
    "examples",
    "let's say it was early on in this",
    "pandemic",
    "and let's say the president of the",
    "united states had not yet imposed",
    "uh an order stopping flights coming in",
    "from china",
    "and let's say you had a group of",
    "citizens people who came in for muhan",
    "let's say you had a group of citizens",
    "who came in from wuhan",
    "uh do you mean that the state should not",
    "have the ability to quarantine these",
    "people",
    "uh that makes absolutely no sense",
    "what about if today from uh some",
    "let's say um in mexico",
    "central america south america there's a",
    "area that's red hot uh with the covered",
    "virus",
    "and we have people who are coming",
    "immigrants ill",
    "maybe coming up here um are you",
    "maybe some legal maybe some illegal are",
    "we saying that",
    "we don't have the ability we shouldn't",
    "have the ability to quarantine those",
    "people and protect ohio",
    "citizens and i could go on and on with",
    "examples so yes of course i'll veto the",
    "bill i mean look",
    "this makes absolutely no sense and i",
    "think when you you know",
    "when you play it out and look at all the",
    "different scenarios",
    "you know we cannot be defensive i will",
    "not leave ohio",
    "defenseless against this kind of",
    "spread and attack so no i will certainly",
    "veto the bill",
    "next question is from marty schladen at",
    "the ohio capitol journal",
    "afternoon governor hi marty i'm going to",
    "follow up on lord's question",
    "um particularly as your donald trump's",
    "honorary co-chair in ohio",
    "uh the president again cast doubt",
    "on the legitimacy of any election that",
    "didn't make him winner",
    "and he would not say that he would abide",
    "by",
    "the results of that and that's created",
    "some fear out there",
    "that his followers won't either do you",
    "specifically condemn those remarks",
    "i'm not going to condemn anything i",
    "don't know what's in his heart and his",
    "mind and",
    "you know look anybody for who runs for",
    "president",
    "um wants to win uh",
    "and they want they're going to fight and",
    "they're going to fight all the way",
    "through",
    "but without exception i believe",
    "throughout american history the loser",
    "once it's determined that you are the",
    "loser",
    "concedes uh and we move on",
    "that will happen whoever loses this",
    "election so i you know i understand",
    "you know a lot of a lot of the news",
    "media the last 24 hours about that",
    "but that is not going to happen um",
    "whoever loses",
    "whoever loses uh once it's the votes are",
    "counted and you know if any",
    "any recounts or anything are done once",
    "that's done",
    "and it's determined that we have a",
    "winner then",
    "the loser goes off stage that's the way",
    "that's the way our system works",
    "we've had no one who's not done that to",
    "my knowledge",
    "that will continue next question",
    "is from dan perlman at wcmh in columbus",
    "hello governor president trump intends",
    "to nominate his selection",
    "for the supreme court on saturday 38",
    "days before the november election",
    "you spent 12 years in the senate",
    "yourself given that experience",
    "do you believe this nominee can and",
    "should",
    "receive a fair hearing and vote so close",
    "to november 3rd",
    "and following up on that previous",
    "question given that the president",
    "is not committing to peaceful",
    "transitional power does this cause you",
    "to waver in your support of him at all",
    "no i support the president look the",
    "president has",
    "put on the bench uh the district court",
    "circuit courts he did exactly what he",
    "said",
    "he was going to do he's put on some fine",
    "fine people uh put people on the supreme",
    "court as well",
    "and so no no i certainly support the",
    "president",
    "i served 12 years in the united states",
    "senate uh 12",
    "all of those years i was on the senate",
    "judiciary committee",
    "we had a number of nominations come",
    "through we had two",
    "for the supreme court uh my position",
    "always was",
    "and if i was on there today it would be",
    "the same and that is that",
    "um i would wait because i was on",
    "judiciary committee and we were gonna",
    "have a hearing",
    "uh i would wait until the hearing",
    "process was over",
    "to announce whether i was voting for",
    "that nominee or not",
    "for that nominee i did the same thing",
    "with district courts i believe in in",
    "circuit courts by and large",
    "um so if i was on there today that's the",
    "position that i would i would take",
    "but the president has a constitutional",
    "right to submit names to the senate",
    "uh senate has a constitutional right to",
    "um",
    "vote on them um look it's",
    "this is a a different i won't belabor",
    "everyone with the long history",
    "of the filibuster but uh you know",
    "it was friends on the other side who",
    "decided that uh",
    "a filibuster for district courts and",
    "circuit courts were not the",
    "you know were going to go away and",
    "you know it was clear if they had been",
    "in power they probably would have done",
    "the same would have done the same thing",
    "for the supreme court and then",
    "republicans did the same thing for the",
    "supreme court and that's water of the",
    "dam",
    "that's why i have an opinion about that",
    "but it's water it's water",
    "water over the dam and so for the people",
    "who are critical",
    "uh of of you know the president or",
    "senate republicans or mitch mcconnell",
    "look",
    "both parties have switched positions",
    "let's be candid about it",
    "uh it's not just republicans that have",
    "seemingly switched positions",
    "as democrats who switched their position",
    "that's what it is so um you know look i",
    "if i was in the senate i would vote uh",
    "you know",
    "in in the committee when the chairman",
    "called the vote",
    "i would vote and i would vote when the",
    "vote came up on the senate floor",
    "next question is from molly coweek at",
    "w-h-i-o",
    "in dayton molly",
    "hey governor this is a follow-up from a",
    "couple of other reporters questions so",
    "along with the lieutenant governor your",
    "co-chair of president trump's ohio",
    "re-election campaign",
    "yesterday the president cited concerns",
    "over mail-in ballots leading to election",
    "fraud it would not commit to a peaceful",
    "transition of power as we've mentioned",
    "so i have a two-part question is the",
    "state of ohio committed to counting",
    "every mail-in ballot",
    "and part two if by the time all the",
    "mail-in ballots including",
    "those the absentee ballots that are",
    "counted and joe biden were to win ohio",
    "what has the trump campaign said to you",
    "about the legislature setting",
    "aside ohio's popular vote because of",
    "voter fraud concerns",
    "and letting the legislature exercise its",
    "power to directly choose electoral",
    "college members",
    "yeah i'm getting i'm getting some real",
    "feedback uh",
    "and other voices on your last one i i i",
    "so if you could just do it again",
    "i certainly missed the last part of it",
    "what if the",
    "trump campaign said what",
    "that's okay i can ask the full question",
    "again um so is the state of ohio",
    "committed to counting every mail-in",
    "ballot",
    "and if by the time all ballots including",
    "mail-in ballots are counted and joe",
    "biden were to win ohio",
    "what is the trump campaign said to you",
    "about the legislature setting aside",
    "ohio's popular vote",
    "because of voter fraud concerns and",
    "letting the legislature exercise its",
    "power to directly choose electoral",
    "college members",
    "well no one look no one wants to see um",
    "the people of the state not have the say",
    "in regard to what electors",
    "are selected uh you know that that",
    "you know it's been a long long time you",
    "know we don't want to",
    "have that situation we want the people",
    "to be able to vote and their votes to be",
    "counted",
    "do i think that ohio has the ability to",
    "count the votes yes",
    "uh it will do it consistent with the law",
    "uh the law",
    "as i understand it and the secretary",
    "former secretary of state can correct me",
    "uh if i'm wrong but it's basically you",
    "have to if you're sending it in by",
    "mail you have to have a postmark by",
    "monday uh and then",
    "it is a 10 days there is a 10-day window",
    "for that",
    "to get there and so that law would be",
    "followed",
    "those votes would be counted when they",
    "were within the",
    "confines of this of this of the statute",
    "so everything is fact specific but",
    "your question your second part of your",
    "question you know if the",
    "campaign trump campaign asked me to work",
    "with the legislature to set aside",
    "the vote of the people the state of ohio",
    "no that's not what",
    "should happen no no it's the people's",
    "vote",
    "and look we have what we call absentee",
    "ballots in ohio",
    "and we allow absentee ballots for any",

    "true and tested uh we're not a state",
    "that just",
    "mails out ballots to everyone which i",
    "believe",
    "is primarily the concern that the",
    "president has expressed about",
    "some states and their process for",
    "mail-in ballots",
    "ohio's process of mail-in ballots is the",
    "same process",
    "that we use the last time when the",
    "president won the state by eight points",
    "so that nothing has changed about it it",
    "worked well",
    "during the president's previous election",
    "it will work well",
    "in this election because as i mentioned",
    "earlier",
    "it's a bipartisan process there are",
    "numerous checks and balances both in",
    "requesting your ballot",
    "receiving your ballot and returning your",
    "ballot",
    "that makes sure that the person casting",

    "it really is us against the virus",
    "on the other issues we may have",

    "intolerance",
    "and love and people trying to work",
    "together",

    "these things that whether we agree",
    "with a police officer or not",
    "um you know try to respond to that",
    "police officer",
    "there's a time and a place to do other",

    "shield that'd be fine",
    "and went back and forth for for a while",
    "and basically they've asked her to leave",

    "can hold this down this is the police",
    "department's",
    "report and they can get more of the",
    "facts um",
    "but what the superintendent told me",
    "uh i made some notes he talked about the",
    "officer",
    "he said the officer is our resource",
    "officer works with kids",
    "all the time uh to quote the",
    "superintendent could not be a kinder",
    "person",
    "uh he reminds people in a very nice way",
    "what they",
    "need to do in this particular case",
    "superintendent said that she simply",
    "would not comply",
    "with his request to leave",
    "um",
    "he also pointed out that there were you",
    "know he says we're very transparent",
    "we let everyone know what to expect we",
    "have signs everywhere telling people",
    "what to expect what to do",
    "we follow the ohio high school athletic",
    "association in the ohio department of",
    "health",
    "rules and then he said something that i",
    "think i'll always remember",
    "he said the governor any day our kids",
    "are in school",
    "is a good day any day our kids are",
    "playing",
    "sports is a good day win or lose",
    "and we're going to try to do and follow",
    "the rules and do everything we",
    "can to have our kids continue to play",
    "we started this discussion about",
    "schools and schools and sports and",
    "schools a number of months ago",
    "we wanted to keep our kids safe we",
    "wanted to keep the people working in the",
    "schools safe",
    "we wanted to have our kids play sports",
    "but we didn't know how to balance all",
    "that out",
    "and we came up with a plan that's kind",
    "of an ohio plan",
    "which is we let each school district",
    "make their own decision and we let of",
    "course the parents make their own",
    "decision",
    "on this particular school you know they",
    "made a decision",
    "we announced that then we looked at",
    "starting sports how are we going to make",
    "sports safe",
    "and we came up with what we were hearing",
    "from people is we want our kids to play",
    "we want our kids to play",
    "i get it we've had eight kids and",
    "they've all",
    "played sports uh we got many grandkids",
    "that played sports it's important",
    "and so we said how can we do that and",
    "the way we did it",
    "was that we came up with some protocols",
    "and said let's get let's do what's",
    "important what's important is the",
    "kids can play number one number two we",
    "want the parents",
    "or or whoever is important in that",
    "child's life to be able to go",
    "to the game and so we set that out",
    "and opened it up some states didn't do",
    "that some states restricted football",
    "some were states",
    "restricted contact sports we felt that",
    "it was worth the risk for these kids to",
    "be able to do this",
    "and so we set up the protocol then we",
    "worked with the ohio high school",
    "athletic association",
    "to come up with how this was going to be",
    "policed quote unquote or",
    "regulated and how this was going to work",
    "and they set forth guidelines and we",
    "worked with them on on",
    "on on doing that we've had phenomenal",
    "success",
    "that doesn't mean some kids may not ha",
    "have contracted the covet where they did",
    "it in sports or not",
    "probably never know but overall this has",
    "worked exceedingly well and it's worked",
    "because",
    "ohioans have done a phenomenal job",
    "parents have done what they needed to do",
    "the school's done what they needed to do",
    "the students have worn masks and done",
    "what they needed to do",
    "and to my knowledge i don't think",
    "there's been any other case",
    "there might have been some but i don't",
    "think there's any other case besides",
    "this one",
    "where we turn and we see something",
    "that's gone viral",
    "and something that clearly looks bad",
    "and something that no one wants to see",
    "but i would just say to people who are",
    "judging the school",
    "people who are judging that officer",
    "people who are judging the",
    "school official who you see in the video",
    "uh look",
    "they were trying to follow the",
    "guidelines of the ohio high school",
    "athletic association",
    "the health department with the sole",
    "purpose of they wanting their kids to",
    "play",
    "and that's what they did uh and i think",
    "if you look at",
    "you know before you just look at the",
    "video look at what led up to that video",
    "i i think that you'll get a a full",
    "picture of of of what happened very",
    "unfortunate very unpleasant to look at",
    "no one wants to see that happen",
    "and uh you know it's it's it's sad when",
    "we we see something like that",
    "happen john i know you want to make a",
    "say something",
    "oh well governor yeah i would just",
    "reiterate that you know",
    "people people are going through a trying",
    "time",
    "and i know that on occasion they they",
    "uh they have conflicts with one another",
    "and we have to work through them",
    "and and we have to do work through them",
    "for our kids and",
    "for the sake of trying to be able to",
    "continue to do these things and",
    "and for the most part people have done",
    "that",
    "i know we don't want to see any of these",
    "things ever end up",
    "where where they did in this particular",
    "video",
    "that's not where we want to see things",
    "go and that requires all of us",
    "to exercise some civility with one",
    "another and to respect each other's",
    "responsibilities to respect the rules",
    "and to and to try to de-escalate",
    "situations and and not to escalate them",
    "because really all of us on the outside",
    "watching those",
    "sports we're supposed to be there to",
    "support those kids",
    "and um hopefully we will not",
