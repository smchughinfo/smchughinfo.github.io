    "that dr johnson thank you very much for",
    "for joining us thank you very much",
    "governor and thank you for",
    "everything you and your team are doing",
    "to keep us",
    "safe and healthy well we just wanted to",
    "give get a report",
    "uh about what's going on at ohio state i",
    "know dr johnson you've been",
    "uh ohio state's been very engaged in",
    "testing",
    "uh students and uh maybe if you can kind",
    "of give us an overview of uh",
    "you know when school started back up and",
    "how many students are on campus how many",
    "are",
    "living in the columbus community and",
    "kind of what you've been doing in regard",
    "to testing",
    "thank you very much governor so as you",
    "said we",
    "started up our first full week of",
    "classes started",
    "the week of august 24th we have about 12",
    "000",
    "students living on campus we have about",
    "20",
    "000 students that are coming back to get",
    "some kind of face to face or in",
    "classroom instruction",
    "so that's about 8 000 off campus they",
    "come to campus",
    "and about 12 000 that are on campus so",
    "um prior to me coming to the ohio state",
    "university you know certainly an",
    "outstanding team under leadership of dr",
    "gail marsh",
    "set up a strategy for returning to",
    "campus",
    "and once i came in i started working",
    "with the team and we decided to",
    "enhance our testing so we really are",
    "focusing on three groups right now",
    "we're focusing on those you know 11 and",
    "a half to 12 000 students that live on",
    "campus",
    "mostly first year students and some",
    "second year students few international",
    "students",
    "and then 8 000 students that are off",
    "campus that come to campus",
    "so that's sort of our group too and",
    "group three would be the 2500",
    "faculty staff and graduate teaching",
    "instructors that we have so we're",
    "starting to test them fully",
    "so today just by the numbers i am an",
    "engineer so i like to geek out on the",
    "numbers a little bit",
    "um we've tested about forty thousand uh",
    "we've done about forty thousand tests i",
    "should say so we're doing this on a",
    "weekly basis",
    "we're ramping up to do about twenty",
    "thousand tests a week this is our third",
    "week",
    "so the forty thousand we have about",
    "fifteen hundred students that have",
    "tested positive",
    "and uh twenty five employees",
    "so fifteen hundred out of about forty",
    "thousand",
    "is a positivity rate of around three",
    "point seven percent",
    "now this isn't just a flat rate you know",
    "it's gone up",
    "the on-campus uh positivity rate",
    "peaked in and around august um",
    "you know like 28-29 we have a dashboard",
    "that's up",
    "at about 5.87 percent",
    "so the fact that it has dropped and it",
    "kind of you know bounced around just",
    "like we've seen with the state of ohio",
    "but is a reason for cautious optimism",
    "that are non-pharmaceutical",
    "interventions",
    "really are working so wearing masks",
    "staying socially distant",
    "washing hands and our students i",
    "couldn't be prouder of them they've been",
    "very vigilant off campus we had a pretty",
    "high number",
    "when we started testing them at scale",
    "last week i think",
    "that it was uh add or over 11 percent",
    "and now that's dropped in the recent",
    "dashboard it is",
    "at about 5.45 for the last 24",
    "hours so we're seeing that again",
    "when i walk around campus and i walk",
    "around columbus you know i see our",
    "students",
    "uh more on campus we need our off-campus",
    "uh",
    "students faculty and staff and",
    "individuals in columbus to be ever so",
    "vigilant wearing masks but",
    "wearing the masks staying socially",
    "distant it really works",
    "so um that's sort of the status with",
    "regard to testing sir",
    "so doctors i recall i think you you may",
    "have told me that",
    "when students came back you started of",
    "course the testing",
    "uh and you know that's kind of snapshot",
    "the first couple days back",
    "um the numbers were i think pretty low",
    "that's good right somewhere around a",
    "half of one percent",
    "i think you told me something like that",
    "and then",
    "is is that right or am i well i think",
    "you're close i think i don't remember",
    "exactly but i think it was a it was",
    "certainly less than two percent",
    "maybe it was one and a half percent i",
    "think that was the number but",
    "but low as you said uh then it goes up",
    "right and that and now it's and now it's",
    "coming down and i think that",
    "you know what is going on at ohio state",
    "is instructive because you are doing",
    "a very very significant amount of",
    "testing so",
    "you you really have a a very good feel",
    "for what is",
    "is going on and i think you know that",
    "that might be helpful to",
    "you know other uh places uh particularly",
    "colleges universities who might not have",
    "the capability to do the extensive",
    "testing that that you were",
    "you or you were doing um so it sounds",
    "like they weren't bringing it",
    "in at a very high rate students get",
    "together",
    "do what students do do what we all do",
    "and this gets up",
    "but but obviously your your messaging",
    "sounds like it",
    "is is having some impact now and the",
    "kind of",
    "maybe maybe peer pressure but i wonder",
    "if you could maybe",
    "talk a little bit about that why do you",
    "think it's starting to come down or is",
    "coming down",
    "right well i think there's a couple",
    "things in thank you governor i think",
    "one of the things we recognize is we",
    "really had to amp up our",
    "our contact tracing so as soon as we get",
    "back a result that uh",
    "student faculty or staff is positive we",
    "start contact tracing immediately",
    "so then we were able to isolate and",
    "quarantine those individuals that needed",
    "to be",
    "isolated quarantined or treated so i",
    "think that was one thing the second",
    "thing is that our student life",
    "organization led by dr melissa shivers",
    "has just been outstanding",
    "and she's really engaged the whole",
    "community",
    "on together as buckeyes so it's taking",
    "the pledge",
    "recognizing that yes we can do",
    "alternative programming",
    "and uh still in enjoy but at a distance",
    "the college experience and i think that",
    "it was as you said",
    "students coming together for the first",
    "time and not recognizing that it's",
    "pretty easy to",
    "transmit this virus but it's also pretty",
    "easy if you do just a couple things wear",
    "a mask and stay socially distant",
    "to stop it transmitting and so i think",
    "that was",
    "another uh thing i think a third thing",
    "is that we have a",
    "college of public health led by dr amy",
    "fairchild and they started modeling",
    "and started modeling certain behaviors",
    "and and then modeling how those",
    "behaviors translate into",
    "positive cases and then what our",
    "capacity would need to be in order to",
    "trace and then isolate and quarantine",
    "and so i think coming together",
    "the wexner medical center has been",
    "superb they do about 500 tests a day for",
    "us",
    "for symptomatic so the way we've parsed",
    "it is we have the student health",
    "student health system services and the",
    "webster medical center",
    "be available for symptomatic individuals",
    "and then we do the asymptomatic tracing",
    "through a third party provider because",
    "the last thing we want to do is",
    "take up any of the capacity from the",
    "state of ohio for",
    "ohioans that need access to the testing",
    "so that's been our strategy and i think",
    "that",
    "that together as buckeyes we've engaged",
    "great athletic director of gene smith",
    "he's gotten the athletes that done these",
    "um social media campaigns about",
    "what's your why you know why are you",
    "going to wear a mask and why are you",
    "going as",
    "socially distant for me i came back to",
    "the academy because i love the students",
    "i want to see the students",
    "out there on the oval i want to see the",
    "faculty the staff i want to attend all",
    "the",
    "the performances and the lectures and",
    "the richness that",
    "just drives a university and that's my",
    "why and",
    "each of us has a y and if we just dig",
    "down and pull up that y",
    "i think it's pretty straightforward why",
    "we want to do the things that will keep",
    "us safe",
    "doctor that you expressed that very very",
    "well we each have a reason",
    "we each have a a goal and i assume for",
    "many students it's",
    "it's simply to be on campus to be part",
    "of ohio state or be hard",
    "part of whatever college that uh that",
    "they're they're going to",
    "um you mentioned a kind of a difference",
    "in numbers between",
    "off campus and on campus and i'm going",
    "to make a statement you don't have to",
    "agree with it but",
    "i just assume that it's easier uh",
    "for a college",
    "to control what's going on directly on",
    "campus classrooms for example",
    "you can do the social distancing you can",
    "do those things",
    "when people are off campus they might be",
    "you have",
    "thousands of students who are in",
    "non-ohio state housing",
    "i so so i assume that that maybe gets a",
    "little more difficult",
    "you want to comment on that well it uh",
    "yes no thank you governor i think that",
    "as you know and you were great to be on",
    "the call earlier today with our inter",
    "university uh president's council of all",
    "the 14 public institutions in the",
    "country and i think we're seeing all the",
    "same thing",
    "is that on campus when we the classroom",
    "is one of the safest places to be",
    "you know we disinfect the classrooms",
    "couple times a day we reconfigured 450",
    "classrooms so that we can be synchronous",
    "and asynchronous in our instruction",
    "we reduce the size of our classes from",
    "100",
    "down to 50 because the models would say",
    "that in that situation",
    "you can actually um have a pretty pretty",
    "high probability of avoiding someone who",
    "is",
    "infectious that would be in the",
    "classroom so we find the classrooms are",
    "safe",
    "our our dorms we have great residential",
    "advisors",
    "and they're being very creative about",
    "how do we engage students in programming",
    "when you have to stay six feet apart",
    "and i can just say one thing about that",

    "put together a fantastic resource called",
    "safer at home it's available at",
    "clevelandclinic.org coven19",
    "a-t-h-o-m-e what i think is particularly",
    "valuable",
    "is a matrix that they have come up with",
    "help families weigh the risk",
    "of contracting cova 19.",
    "so joining us today is the associate",
    "chief",
    "safety and quality officer of the",
    "cleveland clinic dr aaron",
    "hamilton to kind of explain that dr",
    "hamilton thank you very much for joining",
    "us",
    "thank you governor and good afternoon i",
    "wanted to express some gratitude just to",
    "start for you and your team's leadership",
    "uh for all ohioans to the pandemic",
    "so um i i'm really thrilled to be able",
    "to come here and talk a little bit",
    "about a framework for people to think",
    "families to think about um as they make",
    "decisions",
    "as you mentioned about what they're",
    "going to be doing returning to different",
    "activities",
    "as we return to you know a community",
    "that's looking more and more normal the",
    "natural question is you know what is",
    "safe what is not safe how do i make sure",
    "that",
    "i'm safe my family's safe my community's",
    "safe",
    "i think one of the things that i see is",
    "that",
    "all the questions that come up things",
    "can get complex very quickly",
    "and what people lack is just a simple",
    "framework",
    "to kind of make assessments about what's",
    "the level of risk",
    "and then people are then empowered to",
    "make decisions on their own and i think",
    "about that framework",
    "very very simply in terms of time",
    "space and people and the time part is",
    "really about",
    "time how much time are you going to",
    "spend an activity",
    "you know is it a little amount of time",
    "is it a long activity",
    "and in that same time dimension i think",
    "about",
    "how frequently you're going to be doing",
    "an activity so it's both the duration of",
    "time and then the frequency",
    "so time then space is this an indoor",
    "activity",
    "is it an outdoor activity is there the",
    "ability",
    "to socially distance how can you spread",
    "out",
    "or not needs to be taken into",
    "consideration",
    "and then lastly people and we don't",
    "think about this a lot",
    "but i urge families and and and folks to",
    "consider how well do you know the people",
    "that you're going to be interacting with",
    "and how well do you know that they're",
    "adhering to",
    "the safe guidelines that we've put out",
    "there and i think actually president",
    "johnson did an amazing job of outlining",
    "what some of those simple things that",
    "have been really effective for us in",
    "ohio",
    "and across the country across the globe",
    "and it begins",
    "and ends really with hand hygiene and",
    "washing our hands",
    "it's about face coverings or masks and",
    "it's about providing",
    "appropriate physical distancing and",
    "thinking about that six feet all the",
    "markings we see on the floors",
    "when we go out into the community in our",
    "schools",
    "and otherwise so that's really the",
    "framework that we're asking",
    "people to use and you can think about",
    "what is the safest thing",
    "is me or one of us or a family member",
    "seeking health care whether it's well",
    "care or emergency care",
    "our health care institutions in the",
    "state of ohio are open",
    "and they are safe so that is on the",
    "spectrum",
    "extremely safe on the other end of the",
    "spectrum you could think about",
    "a wedding that's indoor and has a lot of",
    "folks",
    "all gathered together difficult",
    "social distancing maybe borderline",
    "compliance with masks and shared food",
    "that's a high risk environment and",
    "that's thinking about that time",
    "space and people matrix so we're really",
    "urging people to",
    "think about that to inform decisions",
    "that make it appropriate",
    "for them personally as they move forward",
    "so doctor that's time space in people",
    "let's let's take a couple of you want to",
    "give us a couple more examples",
    "and tell us what the analysis would be",
    "yeah",
    "um you i'll let you pick them",
    "okay sure well i think one of the things",
    "that comes to mind it's certainly top of",
    "mind for those with",
    "children whether it's going to",
    "kindergarten or third grade or sixth",
    "grade or 12th grade",
    "college is our back to school this year",
    "is not a back to normal right and so",
    "we have to think that it will look and",
    "feel different",
    "and there will be a focus to ensure",
    "safety so this is a space",
    "from a time perspective you're going to",
    "be going",
    "spending multiple hours if it's in",
    "person so",
    "that element you're going to be spending",
    "time there and you're going to be going",
    "frequently",
    "space often in indoor activity",
    "but schools are working to create space",
    "limiting class sizes and creating the",
    "opportunity to get appropriate physical",
    "distancing",
    "and then people we know our teachers are",
    "doing everything that they can to remain",
    "safe",
    "and following all the core uh guidelines",
    "to stay safe",
    "and then our friends and our colleagues",
    "our co",
    "students hopefully are doing the same so",
    "in the end",
    "going back to school i'm i'm hopeful",
    "that",
    "um we can with our collective efforts",
    "uh get our children and our our students",
    "back to school in a meaningful",
    "uh way hopefully in person over time",
    "so that's just one example we're",
    "thinking about that another example",
    "people often think about is going to a",
    "restaurant",
    "you know many people through the",
    "pandemic haven't been going out to eat",
    "or have thought twice about that and i",
    "think what i ask people to do there is",
    "to understand",
    "those decisions around time space and",
    "people",
    "is call ahead find out what the",
    "restaurant's doing",
    "think about carryout think about if",
    "there's outdoor dining",
    "and think about if you know if employees",
    "in that restaurant are",
    "required to wear masks or not and that",
    "helps you make a decision",
    "for you personally i think the last",
    "thing is",
    "thinking about how we get together with",
    "our friends and family",
    "and these can be difficult conversations",
    "and i think it's important",
    "i'll focus here on the people part is",
    "sometimes",
    "you know it's important to understand",
    "what our families",
    "and what our friends are doing if",
    "they're wearing masks",
    "if they're appropriately socially",
    "distancing and we have to use that and",
    "incorporate that and decide",
    "maybe it's better to do a zoom visit or",
    "a facetime call",
    "with family this week as opposed to",
    "getting together in person",
    "so we have to think about that and all",
    "the decisions we make to get together",
    "let's say i decide i'm get up some",
    "morning or",
    "later in the afternoon and i said i want",
    "to go walk on a bike path",
    "yeah what are the variables there how",
    "safe is that",
    "that's great so me and my family we love",
    "to use the metro parks we go hiking",
    "almost every weekend",
    "um there time usually not a huge time",
    "commitment",
    "space it's outside it's generally spaced",
    "apart we might see a couple people",
    "and we don't typically know who those",
    "people are so what we do",
    "is when we're around folks on the path",
    "we'll wear a mask",
    "and we work to create social distance",
    "there",
    "but otherwise if we're walking or we're",
    "biking",
    "we or we're running we don't need to",
    "wear a mask and we feel like that's a",
    "very safe activity",
    "particularly in our own neighborhood but",
    "generally we always bring it with us we",
    "we never leave home without our mask",
    "now you mentioned uh let's let's let's",
    "say a wedding",
    "and let's let's look at the time the",
    "time factor um",
    "uh maybe maybe i'm not saying one of",
    "these is",
    "more or less safe but let's let's take",
    "a wedding that's an outdoor wedding and",
    "uh",
    "people are people are spread out um and",
    "let's say it's a 20-minute wedding",
    "compare that with maybe uh let's say",
    "uh a similar wedding but now we now we",
    "tack on to it an",
    "indoor uh indoor reception you wanna",
    "kind of walk us through some of that",
    "yeah absolutely so that that wedding uh",
    "that you described on the front end of",
    "your remarks",
    "uh sounds like a very friendly wedding",
    "in this environment to go to a very safe",
    "wedding",
    "outside short you generally know the",
    "folks",
    "you're able to space space out and",
    "create distance great",
    "the reception indoor that is a decision",
    "that we",
    "you know i actually asked people to make",
    "for themselves so you say",
    "what kind of space is there are people",
    "wearing masks indoors",
    "or not and you have to make a judgment",
    "call",
    "about what's comfortable for you but",
    "clearly that's getting",
    "a little bit higher risk than",
    "actually ceremony part that you",
    "described so in the rubric",
    "that i was describing i think it's",
    "slightly riskier",
    "but you know i think one of the things i",
    "think about and we all should think",
    "about",
    "is approaching the pandemic with",
    "compassion and empathy",
    "and understanding that you know we have",
    "to continue",
    "to kind of live and make choices that we",
    "feel good about",
    "um and are mindful of our fellow",
    "citizens and i think",
    "these are individual decisions and what",
    "we want to provide is that framework",
    "that makes people",
    "be able to kind of measure what the",
    "amount of risk that people are going to",
    "take on is and i think that's the best",
    "way",
    "to take on this pandemic and to continue",
    "to kind of keep our numbers down",
    "dr hamilton thank you very much for",
    "joining us if anyone wants to",
    "read more about this where can they",
    "where can they",
    "read more about what you're doing and",

    "was first issued march",
    "31st it was renewed on april 29th",
    "same order and again on august 31st",
    "this order creates a funding mechanism",
    "to allow for federal reimbursement",
    "for those looking to create places for",
    "people to safely",
    "isolate or quarantine",
    "has been used in a few cases in ohio and",

    "very often but in each one of these",
    "cases",
    "we were taking this authorization from",
    "the federal government agreement with",
    "the federal government",
    "and being able to provide space",

    "professional",
    "and they are working and they do not",

    "uh situation that this was created for",
    "uh again um",

    "uh that incorrectly claimed these orders",
    "allow children to be separated from",

    "uh health folks it gives them a place to",
    "shelter gives them a place",
    "to be so that they don't have to go home",
    "and possibly take that to their family",

    "pat leave us pat sweeney was",
    "a true statesman and her condolence goes",
    "out to his",
    "his dear family ready for questions",
    "governor your first question today is",
    "from joe ingles at ohio public radio and",
    "television",
    "hello governor how are you today i'm",
    "well joe thank you",
    "i want to ask you um we've got these",
    "students who are",
    "in college right now and um as",
    "president johnson was talking about they",
    "are",
    "testing positive that rate she said is",
    "going down and it may go down",
    "but if it continues to",
    "be at a significant level is it",
    "safe to keep those students in college",
    "for the entire semester then send them",
    "home",
    "around thanksgiving where they are",
    "likely to be exposed",
    "to even more vulnerable vulnerable",
    "populations",
    "uh like grandparents and such who might",
    "be around for the holidays",
    "well joe that's an excellent question uh",
    "you know a week ago today we had",
    "discussion with the vice president",
    "uh trump administration doctors and one",
    "of things they said is you know what you",
    "don't want to do is send students away",
    "to college",
    "a couple weeks there and there's",
    "breakouts uh of the virus and then they",
    "leave",
    "and go back home so you know that is",
    "not something that we're looking looking",
    "to have happen i've had discussions i",
    "talked to all 14",
    "uh college presidents this morning with",
    "our state university four-year system",
    "um and they all certainly understand",
    "that",
    "uh you raise the next question though or",
    "or a question that we're gonna have to",
    "face in the future and that is",
    "what about thanksgiving and i think",
    "that's going to take some",
    "real thought",
    "there are some schools that basically",
    "made a decision we're going to close at",
    "thanksgiving and not come back until",
    "january",
    "again though it raises the question of",
    "whenever they leave college and if",
    "if the rate is high there",
    "what are the precautions before they go",
    "back home and you know for colleges that",
    "have the ability to test",
    "and we may have a lot more ability uh",
    "you know by mid to late",
    "november uh than we do today uh but",
    "making sure that we know whether",
    "positive or not before they leave would",
    "certainly be the ideal situation",
    "uh so so we could protect the vulnerable",
    "people who live",
    "in their homes back wherever home home",
    "is so",
    "a very very perceptive question uh it's",
    "a work in progress",
    "but uh i think your sentiment is",
    "absolutely correct",
    "next question is from scott hallis of",
    "the xenia daily gazette",
    "hey governor thank you how you doing hey",
    "good",
    "good good hey so we're we're two weeks",
    "into the football high school football",
    "season",
    "and you know a few weeks into that and",
    "other sports",
    "um what have you heard back from the",
    "folks who are doing the compliance",
    "checking",
    "uh as far as the requirements for",
    "football i",
    "you know i've seen things on social",
    "media but you know you can't trust",
    "everything on social media obviously but",
    "what",
    "what kind of assessment have you heard",
    "back so far",
    "well scott i don't have any statistics",
    "um",
    "you know i was on a conference call 7 15",
    "this morning with",
    "we do this every every monday morning",
    "with all the health directors around the",
    "state",
    "to my knowledge there was nothing",
    "mentioned about football or any other",
    "sport we talked about a lot of different",
    "things a lot of different problems",
    "so that is not you know i'm not saying",
    "there has not been",
    "some problems there may be some",
    "quarantine because one person on that",
    "team or more than one",
    "you know tested positive or had had",
    "symptoms but at least as expressed to",
    "me by health directors you know the much",
    "much bigger concern",
    "is what young people do not on the",
    "not on the playing field or their",
    "practice field uh",
    "but what they or nor in the classroom",
    "but rather what they're doing",
    "other times and we still see",
    "both with students both with college",
    "student and with college students",
    "and with those not in college",
    "uh that the the huge spreader is just",
    "informal parties informal get-togethers",
    "where people are laying their guard down",
    "or they're not wearing a mask",
    "or they're not keeping keeping the",
    "distance so this is occurring",
    "at all ages um we're seeing a lot of it",
    "of course at",
    "the college level but those are would at",
    "least appear from what i'm seeing",
    "to be a much bigger problem uh than",
    "the athletes uh practicing or playing",
    "themselves",
    "but you know as you said it's only two",
    "weeks in we're going to have to",
    "obviously continue to",
    "to watch this i think the schools and",
    "the athletic directors",
    "uh are and and the coaches are working",
    "very closely with their local health",
    "department",
    "and again if anyone's not out there we",
    "just encourage you to do it because",
    "this is really the key uh for us to move",
    "forward not just with",
    "with sports uh but it's the key to us",
    "moving forward and keeping keeping kids",
    "in school governor",
    "thank you governor john john",
    "on the on the high school the ohio high",
    "school athletic association",
    "has been sending out observers to look",
    "at what's happening",
    "and to help the schools make sure that",
    "they're in compliance",
    "i don't have a report on what happened",
    "in week two of football season",
    "but in the first week they found almost",
    "complete compliance or a couple",
    "minor challenges here and there but they",
    "they literally coached him up they they",
    "helped the the local schools understand",
    "what they needed to do",
    "um but but there was you know widespread",
    "compliance and things look pretty good",
    "and then the initial reports and we'll",
    "have con continued information because",
    "we know",
    "usually it goes that way when we start",
    "out we do a pretty good job with it",
    "and then maybe we let it slide a little",
    "bit and we just need to make sure that",
    "that doesn't happen because so far so",
    "good",
    "yeah i think people working very hard at",
    "the event",
    "uh the event itself uh it's just",
    "the other it's the other things in life",
    "uh sometimes get in the way not just",
    "with athletes but with with everyone but",
    "i think by and large the schools are",
    "doing a very good job uh i think",
    "the athletic side of the schools are",
    "doing a good job as well",
    "next question is from max philby at the",
    "columbus dispatch",
    "hey governor hope you had a good holiday",
    "weekend thanks max",
    "thank you so",
    "going off of some stuff this weekend and",
    "also uh the rumor that you were talking",
    "about briefly",
    "um as a covid19 vaccine becomes",
    "available",
    "would you get one and secondly um with",
    "the rumor you're talking about",
    "how important it is is it to dispel some",
    "of these conspiracy theories and things",
    "floating out there like that",
    "well yes i would get a vaccine um",
    "and i think let me just make a comment",
    "about the vaccine i watched some of the",
    "news over the weekend national news and",
    "watched some of the",
    "news this morning look the more we can",
    "do",
    "to take down the politics in regard to",
    "the vaccine look i think we should",
    "look to our scientists and our doctors",
    "let them do what they do let them work",
    "to develop this",
    "and work to develop it in a safe way",
    "so i think that you know that is very",
    "very important and look",
    "the people of this country are going to",
    "file the news",
    "they're going to see you know when this",
    "comes out and this starts to be",
    "available and we don't",
    "know when that will be i mean we've been",
    "notified to be ready by november 1.",
    "but that doesn't mean this is going to",
    "start in november 1.",
    "uh we don't we just don't know we just",
    "don't know when it's going to happen",
    "but i i think people will make their own",
    "judgment on that",
    "and um you know they're going to decide",
    "whether they think it is",
    "it is safe or not but i i think the",
    "officials who are",
    "looking at this um you know are going to",
    "make good decisions and i think",
    "certainly the",
    "um the scientists who are working on it",
    "we all",
    "you know we're all on their side we want",
    "them to get this we want to do a good",
    "job and we want them to get it right",

    "that i get",
    "i look i we'll try to knock down some of",
    "these rumors when we hear them",
    "we can't i can't spend an hour an hour",
    "and a half",
    "uh every time just talking about every",
    "rumor that's up",

    "uh that we that we could um",
    "and we started with not at as much",
    "information as we have to do today i",

    "information we try to share that with",
    "with everyone and try to let people look",
    "at this",
    "from all kinds of different angles",
    "um you know the one to 88 that we put up",
    "there",
    "that's not to shame any county uh it's",
    "not to embarrass anybody",
    "it's just to say look for the last two",
    "weeks at least",
    "this is the number of cases that your",
    "county had",
    "and it just sort of tells you some",
    "something about the spread that is going",
    "on in the county so",
    "our goal is to arm people with as much",
    "information as we can so they can make",

    "order on school reporting",
    "late last week and some of the schools",
    "we've talked to we're surprised that the",
    "only",
    "public reporting requirement for them",
    "is to report to local school districts",
    "that it's optional that they",
    "post numbers and information on their",
    "website or a publicly",
    "facing facebook page why make it",
    "optional",
    "for schools to report their numbers to",
    "the public",
    "uh jackie i'll go back and look at that",
    "our intent was that you know",
    "the schools you know first of all their",
    "first obligation is to the students",
    "and the parents of the students and they",
    "should you know inform them",
    "what we said is they have an obligation",
    "to",
    "which they most of them do anyway they",
    "inform anybody who's in that classroom",
    "if there was a child in that classroom",
    "who comes back and is is positive",
    "then take it the next step also is you",
    "know any",
    "parent of a child in the building where",
    "there is coveted",
    "certainly certainly should know that as",
    "well",
    "we also set up a mechanism where you",
    "know this data will in fact",
    "get reported now we did have some",
    "schools that did express a concern",
    "you know about reporting numbers uh and",
    "particularly in",
    "in a s in a small actually by",
    "building or a small settings so their",
    "pushback was in regard to",
    "um you know that that type of",
    "information",
    "uh might be so specific that it would",
    "disclose",
    "someone's the fact that someone was",
    "coveted which obviously you cannot",
    "you cannot do under undo under the law",
    "but i'll i'll look at the procedure",
    "uh i'll get i'll get back to you on",
    "thursday",
    "next question is from alex ebert at",
    "bloomberg",
    "good afternoon governor thanks for",
    "having us um",
    "have we seen the covet spikes in",
    "colleges across the state",
    "translate into higher rates of",
    "hospitalization at community hospitals",
    "in those areas",
    "or the positive cases currently being",
    "mostly contained to campus",
    "thank you yeah i don't i don't think",
    "we've seen that transfer",
    "into a higher",
    "number of people going into the hospital",
    "in fact i think that's not been true",
    "uh you know one of the concerns is a",
    "kind of",
    "a a kind of a ping-pong ball of fact",
    "uh you know let's say someone who gets",
    "infected who's",
    "18 um as we express",
    "as i expressed a few minutes ago the",
    "concern is they go back home and they",
    "infect someone else",
    "i know there's also a concern with some",
    "of the health departments that some of",
    "our universities some of our schools",
    "with high you know they're showing a",
    "number of young people coming down",
    "students coming down with this they're",
    "concerned",
    "about that possible spread out into the",
    "community",
    "but to my knowledge they've really we've",
    "not seen",
    "much of that yet nor have we seen",
    "you know hospitalization and what we do",
    "know is",
    "while antonio can get pretty sick",
    "they usually do not usually do not end",
    "up in in the hospital",
    "next question is from jack windsor at",
    "wmfd",
    "in mansfield hey jack hi governor",
    "uh this question comes from one of our",
    "viewers who is a parent",
    "and it says quote the cdc said kids are",
    "not getting seriously sick from",
    "coronavirus",
    "not passing it to teachers the white",
    "house medical advisor said the same",
    "and went on to say kids should not be",
    "wearing masks or distancing",
    "these are experts yet we are putting a",
    "lot on our kids to handle",
    "tough emotions educational handicaps and",
    "then making them feel responsible for",
    "the health of their teachers",
    "and other adults the state site says",
    "cases and hospitalizations peaked about",
    "10 days",
    "before the state mass mandate as a",
    "parent i worry about",
    "the health risks of those masks",
    "bacterial and viral infections",
    "but also the emotional consequences the",
    "question governor is",
    "why are we putting the health of adults",
    "on our kids instead of letting the",
    "parents and grandparents",
    "take ultimate responsibility and will",
    "our kids ever be without masks in",
    "schools",
    "thank you well let's talk a little bit",
    "about that",
    "um you know",
    "the science on mask i think is",
    "overwhelming",
    "um we've had a number of experts who",
    "have who have talked at our press",
    "conferences but you don't have to",
    "look at our press conferences you can",
    "look at you know any",
    "number of places uh where experts have",
    "said",
    "you know the importance of mass mass or",
    "are",
    "very very very important um",
    "when we got ready to put our uh",
    "final order on in regard to schools i",
    "had on the phone i told the story before",
    "but we had on the phone",
    "people from children's hospitals all",
    "over the state of ohio",
    "and what was their recommendation the",
    "recommendation was a very",
    "firm every child k through 12 should",
    "have a mask on",
    "you know that is what the experts have",
    "said you know",
    "is there some outlier out there well",
    "maybe there is but",
    "um you know the jury's back uh there's",
    "there's a verdict and the verdict is",
    "that mass work and the mass",
    "should should be used um we do know",
    "um that some kids can get very sick",
    "um but we know that the fatality rate",
    "among",
    "20 and younger is certainly very very",
    "very low",
    "but that's not the fear the fear is a a",
    "they get",
    "sick and",
    "maybe have some long-term damage i i",
    "told you what the numbers that were",
    "given to me at ohio state several",
    "weeks ago in regard to their athletes",
    "that 13",
    "of the athletes who tested positive had",
    "some",
    "some heart problem uh that was not it",
    "was mild",
    "they said in every case it was mild",
    "about 13",
    "and so that's why the recommendation was",
    "when somebody gets off",
    "is recovering from cova and you think",
    "they've recovered they need to be",
    "checked out by a doctor before doing",
    "uh strenuous exercise again we're",
    "listening to what the",
    "what the medical doctors are are telling",
    "us to do",
    "finally we know that children spread um",
    "and the real concern for the community",
    "is",
    "young person gets it they take it back",
    "home there's a grandparent there there's",
    "someone in the home who has",
    "a sibling someone who has a medical",
    "problem",
    "uh and then that person gets it and then",
    "you know we have all the consequences of",
    "of that so we're going to continue to",
    "look at the medical science and listen",
    "to the medical",
    "community listen to our doctors and try",
    "to make our judgments based upon that",
    "next question is from laura hancock at",
    "cleveland.com",
    "hi governor dewine um",
    "hello hi we've had a few recent",
    "tragedies in the state including one in",
    "shaker heights",
    "um a couple weeks ago um which appears",
    "that a father was struggling with mental",
    "health issues and he took his life and",
    "the lives of his family",
    "as we head into shorter and colder days",
    "this fall",
    "and people are becoming more isolated",
    "are you concerned about whether the",
    "state has enough resources to help",
    "people with mental health issues during",
    "the pandemic",
    "and what can we do as individual ohioans",
    "to help those",
    "struggling to prevent these kinds of",
    "tragedies",
    "yeah i think what we can do as",
    "individuals is try to think every day",
    "about you know",
    "who we know friend of ours acquaintance",
    "of ours",
    "that might be feeling isolated because",
    "they're in a nursing home",
    "because they're at home by themselves",
    "and just don't have anybody",
    "so i think that's something that",
    "everybody and i'll i will try to do that",
    "i try to do that every day i don't do it",
    "every day but",
    "uh i'll try to do that today and if",
    "everyone watching this could do that and",
    "pick up the phone call somebody",
    "uh whether you're related to them or not",
    "and just kind of reach out to them",
    "that's a small thing but it's something",
    "that if enough",
    "enough of us do that that does in fact",
    "uh uh",
    "make make a difference um you know",
    "second",
    "i i i would say that i you know",
    "i'm not the expert on isolation i'm not",
    "the expert",
    "certainly on mental health issues but",
    "you know one of the things when i look",
    "at this",
    "mass question jack asked about the mask",
    "but when i look at that",
    "i look at that as a way to be out more",
    "to have more freedom to be able to go",
    "more places",
    "to feel that i'm being protected when i",
    "when i do that and so i don't have to",
    "hunker down at home",
    "all the time now look if you're if",
    "you're older",
    "that's the one question we got about the",
    "two nine-year-olds and they feel safer",
    "in their home we're not gonna",
    "you know tell them not to feel safe but",
    "if people are staying home",
    "they're concerned uh but they would like",
    "to get out you know",
    "if they do it carefully and wear a mask",
    "they can do that and we would certainly",
    "encourage them to",
    "you know to get out and and and and to",
    "do that",
    "i also know just finally uh that",
    "uh director laura chris who's we've had",
    "on here",

    "other",
    "of the stories we read and other things",
    "that we hear about",

    "again governor good afternoon um some",
    "members of your own political party the",
    "republican party in ohio are now pushing",
    "some of these as you say rumors",
    "not just as a story but as a matter of",
    "fact that's where a lot of people",
    "learned about the so-called fema",
    "concentration camps",
    "that are coming and they don't say this",
    "is something that might happen they are",
    "saying this",
    "is fact i just read one on a state",
    "representative's facebook page",
    "pushing this story what would you tell",
    "that person and how do you",
    "uh especially these people who are",
    "saying that you've gone way overboard",
    "and handling this from the very",
    "beginning",
    "how would you deal with these people",
    "because their constituents trust them",
    "they voted for them",
    "and they listened to what these people",
    "say what would you say",
    "well look i mean there's a hundred and",
    "jim thank you for the question there's",
    "132 members of the general assembly",
    "have various uh you know ideas and you",
    "know we work with them and have a",
    "with the vast vast majority of them have",
    "a very good working relationship",
    "and good friendly relationship",
    "look i mean i just i think that there",
    "are rumors out there",
    "and we all like the internet we all use",
    "the internet",
    "we all kind of like the modern world",
    "that we live in but we",
    "we all have to i think um admit uh that",
    "there are some downsides to",
    "to the internet and you know there is no",
    "uh editing there is no",
    "people can publish anything they they",
    "want to and",
    "in this particular case they took two",
    "set of facts",
    "uh they had nothing really to do with",
    "each other they put those two together",
    "and came up with a conspiracy theory",
    "and uh you know we we're not going to",
    "have any uh",
    "fema camps uh we're not going to compel",
    "children to do anything we're not going",
    "to separate children from their family",
    "members",
    "uh you know that's certainly the last",
    "thing that i ever would want to do",
    "so it's just it's just kind of sad to me",
    "that there are people out there",
    "who take a rumor like that put a few",
    "facts together that are unrelated to",
    "each other come up with some conspiracy",
    "theory",
    "and then put it out there and i can tell",
    "people are",
    "listening to it because of the emails i",
    "get or the calls that",
    "that i get so i just decided today to",
    "try to knock at least knock this one",
    "down",
    "and just say look this is there's just",
    "absolutely no truth in this",
    "there's no substance behind it it's just",
    "garbage",
    "next question is from kevin landers at",
    "wbns in columbus",
    "hello governor hey kevin uh governor you",
    "mentioned last week there were some",
    "inconsistencies",
    "with the saliva test results at nursing",
    "homes what's been determined to be the",
    "problem has it been fixed and when do",
    "you think we can expect results and in",
    "that same vein",
    "also the pcr test that you mentioned may",
    "be too sensitive in some cases telling",
    "people",
    "they are positive but not contagious has",
    "that been worked out have you worked",
    "with the hospitals",
    "to try to tweak that so you're getting",
    "the correct results",
    "well i think the pcr tests are are",
    "correct",
    "it's not that they're not correct it's",
    "just kevin as we get further",
    "into this and try to drill down on",
    "you know i'm always interested in",
    "actionable information",
    "you know in what we're trying to do",
    "every day get things done you want",
    "pieces of information that will enable",
    "you to go take an action which in fact",
    "you know in this case lessens the odds",
    "of someone who will get the coronavirus",
    "so the pcr tests are accurate it's just",
    "sometimes",
    "they continue to show a positive even",
    "when that person is not contagious",
    "they may still have that virus there and",
    "it's it's picking it up",
    "but they may not be in fact contagious",
    "so as we move forward",
    "trying to to use the different tests",
    "um in conjunction with each other to",
    "figure out when that person is",
    "is in fact contagious so you can isolate",
    "that person for that period of time but",
    "not",
    "not longer that's really what the goal",
    "is in in regard to",
    "uh the first part of your your question",
    "it would appear",
    "and i'm waiting for a final uh kind of",
    "conclusion from my team",
    "but it would appear that we may have had",
    "a lab problem there",
    "um and so we're still still analyzing",
    "that but that was",
    "what my team told me is the initial uh",
    "conclusion",
    "and uh you know we we have pulled back",
    "uh from that",
    "until we can find out where that either",
    "gets fixed or",
    "or or does not get fixed so we're we're",
    "still",
    "still looking looking at that and i'll",
    "report more",
    "as we know more next question is from",
    "tom bosco",

    "want to know if you've had any",
    "conversations with her about big ten",
    "football",
    "i know how she voted when it was time",
    "for that and now senate leader matt",
    "huffman and other lawmakers in other",
    "states",
    "have come out with a new letter to the",
    "big ten urging them to",
    "are you hearing anything about the",
    "possibility of a chance of a season",
    "beginning in october",
    "and did the big ten make the right call",
    "in their vote",
    "well i don't know whether they made the",
    "right call or not",
    "but i think there certainly is a a",
    "decent chance of there being a season",
    "in football for the big ten for ohio",
    "state which is what we're really",
    "concerned about i talked to gene smith",
    "this morning about that",
    "issue i'm not going to disclose our",
    "conversation",
    "other than i inquired about it he told",
    "me it was still in play",
    "still very much a possibility but as you",
    "know",
    "it's not a secret that dr johnson's",
    "position ohio state's position was to",
    "play",
    "and you know i'm i concur in that",
    "um look the key is always going to be",
    "how it is done uh and",
    "you know as i told some people",
    "i don't know i've said it publicly or",
    "not but",
    "athletes at ohio state with their",
    "capability of testing you know",
    "very very very frequently",
    "you know could potentially be the safest",
    "people",
    "there uh with a couple things coming",
    "together one",
    "very very close in time testing uh and",
    "two a real",
    "uh strong ethic to stay safe",
    "to be able to play football it's sort of",
    "the same thing we're hoping for and",
    "counting on",
    "for other students not just at ohio",
    "state but across the state",
    "that their desire to be there to be in",
    "campus to to be able to participate",
    "in school will be a driving force that",
    "will",
    "hold them back from doing the party at",
    "10 o'clock some night when someone",
    "invites you over and it sounds like it's",
    "a great",
    "it's a great idea so um we hope that",
    "that",
    "that push to have uh have a",
    "a year on campus uh a year at ohio state",
    "or a year at miami or ud or wittenberg",
    "or wherever",
    "uh will be a motivating factor for for",
    "all the",
    "all the students and for the athletes",
    "you know we hope that",
    "that plus uh the ability to to play a",
    "sport that they",
    "they love very very much so so we'll see",
    "i don't know what's going to happen in",
    "regard to the buckeyes but",
    "i know it's still still very much in",
    "play",
    "governor just wanted to give a quick",
    "update on the the",
    "unemployment assistance we have we've",
    "been approved",
    "for 717 million dollars and",
    "that will be paid out until the money's",
    "gone and then at that point in time we",
    "would need",
    "to see an action from congress",
    "appropriating additional money to",
    "continue that program",
    "thanks john governor next question is",
    "the last question today and it belongs",
    "to dan",
    "perlman of wcmh in columbus",
    "hi governor uh franklin county is",
    "back in the top 10 for case occurrence",
    "you said some of that was due to the",
    "number of cases at ohio state",
    "how concerned are you that those",
    "positive cases may lead to a spread",
    "within the greater columbus or franklin",
    "county community",
    "well look it's it's a concern and you",
    "know dr johnson",
    "divided out the positivity among",
