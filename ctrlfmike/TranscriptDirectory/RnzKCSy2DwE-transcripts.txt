[Music]
well good afternoon everyone
i'm wearing a mask today that i got from
cedarville university and also we're in
a
cedarville university tie
cedarville we're doing this from our
home
in cedarville cedarville university is
about two miles from here and i actually
uh had the privilege for a couple years
of teaching there part time along with
dr mark smith uh taught some courses in
political science so that was a lot of a
lot of fun
the room we are in some of you may
recognize the room
is actually where i was sworn in
and this is this room was built by
fran's two brothers
ken and john strewing and they're
great builders and uh did a great
great job and we we enjoy the room a lot
with our just
kind of a place for our family family
together
uh yesterday was uh a kind of a crazy
day
i just saw this um
kind of a kind of a crazy thing to to
take a look at for me anyway
um but it was a kind of a roller coaster
day as i indicated last night it started
we started
here i went to cleveland went to case
to get a test set up by the white house
took the test
left and went to the airport and fully
expected to be going in to see the
president
uh did not have that opportunity because
they told me that i couldn't see the
president
and the reason was that i i tested
positive
so that was a quite a big shock by the
way the president
uh called me today i appreciated that
very much
i wanted to see how i was doing and he
said he had been
told last night uh by secret service
that
i was i was uh actually tested negative
so uh he was just calling to see how i
was getting along we had a good
good good conversation
so i came back and got a test i talked
to dr andy thomas at ohio state who we
have had on here before he's helped us
uh throughout this pandemic and dealing
with the coronavirus
uh so i called him and he's set up a
test uh so fran and i
and and some of the people who work
directly with me every day
eric who's behind the camera there was
one of them and took
took the test and then we went home we
came back here to cedarville and just
waited
uh and and waited fran
fixed me some uh chicken and rice
soup i think she thought we were gonna
we're settled in for the long haul here
uh in dealing with the virus and that's
what we thought
uh but then got the good results last
night
that the test from ohio state had come
back as negative for all of us
they told us they wanted to rerun it
just to double
check they re-ran it a few hours later
we got a call that
those tests have come back negative as
well so we're very happy
obviously happy about that
later this afternoon we'll have dr
peter moeller chief scientific officer
of the
ohio state wexner center who will talk
about
the tests and not my results we have my
results but
we'll talk about the different types of
tests
that that are done uh the test that i
had
uh in cleveland is the antigen test it's
a relatively new
test it's a quicker test um the kind of
the gold stand
standard is what we did at ohio state
and that's the pcr test
so i'll leave it to to peter dr mohler
to
to really talk about that let's go
uh eric to today's daily summary
you know we're kind of seeing some
stabilization really in the cases
we would love to see them going down
more uh but they're running anywhere
from 1100 to 1500
uh and you can kind of see by the up and
down of this over the last 20
21 days if we look at the rest of it
uh nothing you know every time we see
deaths is tragic 34 deaths reported
if you go down to the hospitalizations
uh actually this is consistent
with we've seen some downturn in
hospitalizations which is a good
certainly a good thing to see i see you
at missions uh
running about flat uh kind of up and
down every day
so that's where that is uh let's let's
go now
uh eric to kind of the this map of where
we are this was released yesterday
um you know you're really seeing some
changes and we'll talk about that in a
minute
um we have we have 11 red counties now
mercer county is our only new red county
uh the others are allen kahaga erie
fairfield
franklin licking lucas marion medina and
montgomery
we've seen some positive movement going
in the right direction which we'd like
to see henry county lawrence county
hamilton county
all are no longer read it's particularly
significant
significant for all three and i
congratulate the communities
hamilton county has been read all the
way through this
and they've come off that and that's
certainly what we hope for all the
all the red red counties hamilton county
is really a success story
the business community came together
mayor cranley the county commissioners
everybody kind of pulled together got
the message out mask wearing is just
vitally important
and the percentage of people in hamilton
county wearing mask out in public went
up
went up dramatically and everybody got
behind it so we've seen some great
great results they're very very happy
about that
we know the battle is not over hamilton
county residents
continue to wear the mass continue to be
smart
about the social distancing and just
just be careful
hamilton county is still a fairly high
number but it's certainly a lot better
than it was and as we said
hamilton county it's great to see down
here the red
the red is gone from that that part of
the state or at least that
part let's go up to a few other counties
allen county um
okay a group home outbreak jumped from
11 cases last week now to 13.
13 excuse me 13 more this week for a
total of 24 associated with the outbreak
since mid-july
typically the average number of cases
they report every day as 12 to 13.
they had 117 cases during the past two
two weeks cuyahoga county still red
but seeming to do better they had a
steady decrease in daily number of cases
reported and again
folks in kaha county thank you we're in
the mask and
keeping the social distance they still
though exceed the cdc's threshold for a
high incidence which is a hundred
they're at 114. during the course of a
week
they dropped about 40 cases a day so
real movement
in regard to cuyahoga county
erie county erie county cases remained
elevated although they had initial
outbreaks associated with putin bay
the virus continues unfortunately to
spread throughout the community
down in central ohio fairfield county
continues to have a high number of cases
121 per 100 000
an outbreak in a long-term care facility
has 14
cases so far uh informal gatherings and
formal gatherings also are driving
increased case numbers and again that's
what we're seeing frankly
across the state it's these informal
kind of get-togethers
franklin county continues red this week
in part because of new outbreaks related
to restaurants
long-term care facilities and a health
care
facility
licking county high number of cases
is being driven by a church gathering
that had 42 cases
and long-term care facilities also with
significant numbers
up to lucas county several outbreaks in
lucas county have contributed to high
case counts
they include outbreaks at a daycare
center
a local university and a camping
outbreak related to camping their
numbers are high at 189.
now marion county marion county is
close to dropping off red
but not quite there uh long-term care
facility in marion
county uh has more than 60 cases half of
which were linked
uh during the past week medina county
medina
cases are increasing unfortunately in
part related to cases associated with
the manufacturing plant
and family trips out of state to to hot
spots when they're bringing it back
to ohio
mercer county uh and eric well we switch
over and we'll look at the
counties in in the row that we've put
them uh i'll just finish here
mercer county uh very very high 262
cases per hundred thousand residents in
the past two weeks
you'll see this is the whole you'll see
the whole chart
unfortunately mercer county is is at the
top
of that and we'll get to mercer in a
minute montgomery county we're down to
southwest ohio montgomery county remains
read this week in addition to community
spread they've had outbreaks in
long-term care facilities workplaces
and again the family family gatherings
so let's eric let's look at the top 10
counties and again this is what we did
we put these i asked our team to put
these in order
and you can pull those down from our
webpage all
one to 81 to 88 all counties
ranked and again what this is to remind
everybody
every what happened in the last two
weeks how many outbreaks
but then it's it's reconfigured based on
population
so if you take it by population per per
100
000 population uh
unfortunately mercer county is way up
there at 262.
you'll see lucas 189
and if you look at these what is
you know it's disturbing when you see
any any county but what we're seeing
is that the
more urban counties where mask wearing
is become
very very very prevalent it's the norm
now by far
we're seeing a plateau and then starting
to go down
in many of the rural counties we're not
seeing that as you see more of the
orange counties in the map we showed a
minute ago
it's just spreading out into the rural
counties and if you look at the top 10
hottest counties unfortunately you know
you go through these and there's some
small counties in here
mercer county has won wyandotte county
champaign county hancock dark county
fairfield erie uh so these are just
no longer are they your big counties uh
where the high concentration of people
close together these are the more rural
counties
and it's a grave frankly grave concern
to us let me just talk about you know
a little bit about mercer county they're
read for the first time this
week they're showing an increase in
patients in their emergency department
which is worrisome according to local
health officials
now mercer county has had some
significant
big outbreaks you can go back way back
way back in may an outbreak on a farm i
think had
80 cases um
51 cases uh from from an event
a funeral uh 33 of those individuals
were actually from mercer county and
brought it to mercer county
but what's probably more significant
or equally significant is that this has
now spread to the community
today uh the virus has spread all over
mercer county
other health officials tell us that's in
all corners of the county and is
affecting people of all ages so again
my plea to my friends in mercer county
as a wonderful
wonderful county is we're a mask
keep the distance is the only way we can
slow this thing down and we just ask
them to
to please do that
let's turn to athens county athens
county
some good news athens was on the watch
list for risk of going red to purple
highest level on the alert system they
had several outbreaks of bars and
restaurants
and formal gatherings this week they're
yellow
and go all the way down to yellow their
county health officials told us
they're seeing many more people wearing
masks they also said they're
discouraging
smaller gatherings and have encouraged
people to limit their contact with
others
residents are doing what they can to
protect themselves and others
uh so that's just great uh staying home
when they can
hand washing social distancing wearing a
mask so all these things for across the
state of ohio or
what we obviously uh need need to be
doing
uh next week we will be making some
announcements
at some point sometime next week
lieutenant governor and i will be about
sports in ohio
we're going to talk a little bit about
professional sports college sports uh
and of great interest i know uh by the
number of calls i get emails i get
what we're doing about sports in in in
in high school
uh junior high and so we'll have
guidance uh in regard to that
um one of the things i let me just say
and we'll talk more about this next week
but when we talk about our students
when we talk about our student athletes
i truly believe that the schools are
doing absolutely everything they can to
protect our students whether an athlete
or not an athlete whether
whether they're in drama or whatever
they're in i think
whatever their interest is all the
students
our schools are getting ready and doing
absolutely everything
that they can one as i talk to
superintendents
one of one of the concerns is you know
what
young people do when they're not at
school and again
i think this is an opportunity for
teachers it's an opportunity for the
principals
superintendents uh for those who are who
are in athletics the coaches for those
who are in other
service clubs or other things whoever
teacher is is running that
uh and is in charge of that to talk
really to the students
about the rest of the day when they
leave
and how careful that they need to be
one of the grave concerns that we have
is
schools open back up that we have people
who are vulnerable
it may be someone and maybe a child it
may be a child at home
it may be an adult at home maybe a
diabetic father
maybe a mom who has some other medical
problems maybe a grandparent that's
living in the home
and so for those students when they go
home to be very very very careful
uh and to you know
not just when they're going home but
when they're out
with their friends uh you know to wear a
mask
to be careful uh because the people who
are really vulnerable
uh are the ones who have a medical
condition now it would be same way in in
the schools i know our superintendents
are working very hard at principals
teachers everyone to try to figure out
if there's a teacher or someone who has
a medical problem
custodian someone else how best to
help them and to isolate them maybe or
in some way protect them
so we are all all in this together
but i i really believe that uh
what teachers what coaches what others
say to their students over the next few
weeks
is really going to determine to to a
great extent you know how well we do and
if we're able to go back to school
because
i think the schools will do do it well i
think students will do it well in school
the question is when they get out
and they're more relaxed in formal
situations and social situations
are are they being careful and it's just
very very very important
let me give you a update in regard to
tracing
tracing is run by 113 health departments
around
the state of ohio uh we are working very
closely with them we have
extra tracers that we we have hired and
employed
they can surge in for example in mercer
county we have some who
who are helping there in some other
counties
but one of the things that we're been
trying to do is get
better data and so i was asked last week
in a question to provide some additional
data about contact tracing and the
outbreaks and the
stories and where the stories came from
that we've been sharing
i've talked to our team at the
department of health
data related to outbreak outbreaks is
frankly under the current system at the
department of health not very easy to
get
through the ohio disease reporting
system or the ohio contact racing system
and let me talk a little bit about why
that is
and then about what we're doing to help
neither system was designed to pull data
out either system was
designed to data mine which we all just
take for granted
that we want to be able to do and so i
know
some of my friends in the press have
asked for information that we've not
been able to provide
they may be frustrated i am even more
frustrated because i'm asking questions
every day about where we're seeing
outbreaks and information
and so the data systems that we have one
of the systems is 19
years old when it was designed
i'm sure it was state of the art then
but certainly it's not state of the art
now it does not do everything we want it
to do
this is an example of uh frankly the
decades under funding of public health
uh and when this is all over uh you know
as we look to the future now as we look
to the future
we've got to do a better job and frankly
invest more in public health the federal
level the state level and at the local
level
and my commitment is that we will we
will do that and we are doing that
the ohio disease reporting system for
example
was designed to look at outbreaks by
broad categories
is it foodborne or is it hospital
acquired
and not by setting it doesn't index
outbreaks based on the exact kind of
business setting
such as a bar or restaurant or a grocery
store it doesn't tell us that
that information is generally entered by
local health departments in a field that
isn't easily searchable
and isn't always entered the same way
uh consequently we aren't able to pull a
comprehensive list of outbreaks by
specific setting
what we do do is
kind of bypass that system and go
directly to the health departments and
try to get
as much information as we can about what
is occurring
and where the outbreaks are occurring uh
out in the community and you can tell
every week when i talk about that we've
we've pulled some of that down
the stories that we talk about every
week are anecdotal stories
uh that we have collected from the local
health departments we know it's
incomplete but it does
help i think provide a clearer picture
of what is going on
additionally these stories often give us
more detailed information about an
outbreak and demonstrates the true
spread of the virus
let me now now go on
um
let me keep us moving here
um eric let's pull up
dr peter muller who is coming up
we are pleased today to have dr peter
mohler jonas
he is the chief scientific officer for
the ohio state university wexner
medical center and vice dean for
research at the u.s
osu college of medicine dr mueller has
been working with our team for the past
few months
to help us on our testing strategy we're
grateful for his work and expertise
we're grateful for him being here today
doctor thank you
uh for for joining us and i wonder if
you could just
talk a little bit about the different
tests because i know that
what happened with me yesterday uh has
caused some questions and people are
asking
asking about it my understanding is that
i was given
up in cleveland at case in antigen
test later on at ohio state i was taken
i was given a pcr test and i wonder if
you can maybe start off and just kind of
explain
uh what those differences are and
anything you think that we should know
yeah absolutely so first thanks governor
for having me on today
and certainly science is complex and
testing is is equally as complex and so
i'm going to break these into two
different categories of testing and and
equate them to
a high power telescope and a pair of
binoculars and so i'm going to first
focus on the high power telescope so
so when we think about the testing that
we've typically been doing across
ohio we call that pcr testing and this
is an incredibly sensitive
and incredibly accurate it's like a big
telescope
way to look at the virus it actually
looks at the genetic makeup of the virus
looking at the rna
and amplifies it so even a very small
miniscule bit of the virus can be
amplified
and because of that it can be very
sensitive the advantages obviously are
we can detect very low viral loads in
people that may be
either symptomatic or asymptomatic and
it
and and we have the ability to to be
able to look at this over time
the the disadvantages obviously are
things like you know it's hard to scale
this it's hard to have
lots of different high-powered
telescopes across the country across the
state
um it takes a certain type of person to
be able to run them that has had
training
but when we get a result from the pcr
test
similar to looking at a star with a high
power telescope you get a very good
impression of what's happening at that
at that level now i'm going to contrast
that
in a second with with with the antigen
test the test that you had yesterday so
very similar to a pair of binoculars
you're able to look
maybe not at the level that you would
look at with the pcr test so the antigen
test
and that doesn't look at the genetic
material it actually looks at the
the protein on the surface of a of the
virus
um so it's a little bit less sensitive
and so you're going to have things that
we call
false negatives and false positives like
binoculars
you're going to miss some stars but the
good part is you're going to be able to
have
lots of these across the field and the
key point of what we call
point of care testing which these enable
is that
you can find out results within 15 or 20
minutes
and so for the epidemiologists of the
world you're allowed
you're very quickly able to do contact
tracing
be able to quarantine people and be able
to make decisions on health care
with all of these tests though it's
important that we understand their
strengths and limitations and so
in the case of anagen testing which is a
newer type of testing to the state
we want to make sure that before we
would roll this out for our state labs
we would understand really the the the
benefits of doing it and and also some
of the
some of the the disadvantages so in the
state you know we've done almost
1.6 a million um tests using the pcr
test so we know
really a lot about it we're very
familiar with the strengths and
weaknesses
with the anagen test it's still a new
technology we're getting to learn on it
um
you know we've been empowered by your
team to be able to to really study it to
figure out
how it's going to work best for the
citizens of ohio and how to implement it
as part of our strategy
well thank you very much
[Music]
are there other quick things that you
might call a quick
test that are a pcr test
right so so we've often heard and and
i'm excuse me i guess the question you
know i think the assumption might be
that
every quick test is the same and so
maybe if you could just kind of explain
that to us a little bit yeah that's a
that's a great question governor so
there's there's two types of quick quick
tests and these are tests that can be
done sort of in 15 or 20 minutes
the first that i just mentioned is this
anagen test and basically it's a swab of
your throw to your nose
and gets put in this machine and says
yes or no
the other way though is we've heard that
a lot about these abbot point-of-care
tests so this is still a molecular test
like the pcr test
um detecting the rna or the dna of the
of the
of the virus and this is often done like
right now in the emergency
emergency departments as a way to really
triage
uh triage cases it's still a very
accurate test but not quite as accurate
as what we would do
in a clia lab like we were doing here at
the wexner medical center with patel
so if you had to rank those then then
rank them in in the order of the the
most accurate yes sir so we would
we would call the gold standard to be
the pcr test and this would be the test
that
was done twice on you last evening and
again this is going to be the
the one that gets at the very detailed
detailed look at the
dna or the armies of the big and doctor
let me interrupt
that's the test that for virtually
everybody who's watching this who has
had a test
in ohio they probably have had a pcr
test yeah right so the the
vast majority well over 90 percent of
the of the people that have been tested
in ohio have used
the pcr giant giant telescope tester and
this is
standard and and i would say even beyond
that it's the best
and most accurate test right now in the
world
okay i interrupted you you started that
that test
gold standard then what would be next as
far as accuracy
right so you would probably put next
your point of care
abbott id type of test that you would
get tested in the
in the emergency room still quite
accurate a little bit faster
in fact quite a bit faster than the pcr
test it takes
sometimes hours and and we've seen some
backlogs of days
um and then next to that governor below
that would be
some of these things with like the the
antigen test that you took yesterday
morning so
again very fast pretty accurate
but again not quite as accurate as the
pcr test that you took
last night now we've been talking doctor
um with a company that is
been done doing more talking we've
entered a contract with them
a company that uses saliva uh it's a
california company that's livo
it is it's can be administered the
advantage it has
uh is a number of people it's
self-administered for people who can do
that
uh and you could do it in a group and
people would do it and then it
gets mailed to california comes back
where does
what kind of test is that if you know
yes sir so
so specimen collection and this would be
whether it's saliva
or a nasal swab is really really
irrelevant
in terms of what test it uses but but
but typically what we're doing in ohio
is is is pcr-based again this very very
accurate test
that that gets at the the very small
pieces of dna and rna
the other thing governor that i if you
don't mind me mentioning is that
we're beginning to start pilot processes
to be able to do what's called pool
testing
and so this is this process of being
able to look at samples together
because the technology has advanced in a
way that we can
measure very sensitive amounts of dna or
rna
we may be able to put 5 10 or even
15 samples together and and the benefit
of that we've heard a lot about issues
with supply chain
we've seen a lot of issues with
turnaround times this will allow us to
save reagents
to speed up our our turnaround times and
really to be able to
change the way we test as a state and
really redefine our testing strategy
which is exciting
well it is exciting and doctor i first
found out about this was i was on a call
with the vice president
uh probably three four weeks ago and
they talk about pool testing i know what
they're talking about
uh then i found out talk with you um
and so if anyone's not familiar with the
pool testing and correct me if i'm
wrong doctor but you could take let's
say you took four people or five people
you put them in your test you put them
all together you tested them uh if it
comes out negative
you've cleared five people now if it
comes up positive
then you gotta go back and and and take
that samples you already have and do
that testing but
in a state like ohio where we're now
running about 5.5
or 5.6 something like that percent
positivity
it probably makes a lot of sense um if
you're out there with
certainly with people who don't have
symptoms it would make make a lot of
sense to do that i would think
yes sir in fact if you're looking at
asymptomatics
where where right now you know if you
think about a prevalence of less than
two percent or even one percent it might
even allow you to save about
eighty percent of your testing capacity
expanding one to five or one to ten so
it's really uh
it's something that's that's going to be
a game changer and then the really great
part
is a lot of that innovation that has
pushed that is happening right here in
ohio and whether it's
creation of new protocols to be able to
do this partnerships with companies to
be able to allow us to
to move forward or or even relationships
that that you and the lieutenant
governor have set us up with with the
cdc and the fda as well as the white
house
have allowed us to really get out in
front of this as a state
well doctor thanks for everything you've
done thanks for coming in today we may
need you
for some questions that i can't answer
but uh
we appreciate it thanks for what you do
every day for ohio
thank you just like just like to thank
all the people in the labs that are
doing these testing
tests every day it's it's it's a it's a
huge huge effort
and uh they're they're working very hard
and they're working hard all over the
state so we we're very grateful
that thanks doctor thank you very much
let me turn to
uh lieutenant governor hello governor
uh yeah great to great to
be with you in a video connect today
we're used to doing this uh
in the same room but we're we're apart
today we've we've done these news
conferences in a variety of settings in
a variety of different ways and it
continues to
to evolve but i wanted to give a we know
that uh
people across the state are paying
attention to what's happening with
schools
and and schools are preparing to to go
back
and parents and students are in
anticipation
uh while many of them uh want to do it
in person
there are some schools who are going to
open either a hybrid model or
in distance learning uh and and there
are also we also know that even
schools that are going back five days
there are some students who
either themselves or their families are
immunocompromised and so
distance learning is a really important
component
of what's going to happen in ohio during
the course of
of the year and we announced a couple
weeks ago of a
a 50 million dollar grant program
that we were putting together to help
schools
to help support schools in the cost of
providing services to those students who
either don't have access to the internet
that they that they maybe can't afford
it uh there are a variety of
reasons that students struggle to to
connect with distance learning
and uh we're gonna be uh rolling out
applications for that grant starting on
on monday august the 10th that's when
when student or when schools
can start applying reminder this is for
home internet hot spots cellular enabled
devices
public wi-fi and mobile public wi-fi
services again we're targeting those
vulnerable populations of people who are
living in poverty maybe
maybe have chronic health conditions or
no internet access
a little change from where we started
this conversation two weeks ago we
listened we had a lot of schools that
said
because we set it up as a matching
program those schools many of them
couldn't find the resources to do this
as a matching program so we've
we've discontinued the matching
requirement uh
we're going to target you know we only
we have 50 million dollars it's a lot of
money
but it's not going to be enough to
probably serve everyone so we will
uh target it to those who who need it
the most uh the application period um
well i mentioned the application period
but i also want to say that this will
cover
purchases that schools made starting
july 1st
so if they've already made these
purchases you're not going to be
punished for being proactive you're
still eligible to have some of those
costs
recouped if you've made them since july
1st
the application period will be open
through friday august the 21st
and then the schools will be notified of
their awards on
the week of august the 31st all right
while this is not live yet to apply we
will have it up by the end of the day
governor we're going to put this on your
social media accounts the the
site address and my social media
accounts it's going to be in ohio dash
k12 dot help forward slash broadband
ohio
dash connectivity dash grant that's a
long web address so that's why we're
gonna
we're gonna post it out there so people
can can find it
and see it and been able to access to do
those applications
another thing that we have done to help
schools so that they don't have to go
out and try to
purchase this stuff all on their own
we've done a request for information
we've had 12 companies so far respond
to that which will which publicly will
will show us the prices that they're
going to offer for schools and students
this is available at
procure.ohio.gov
again to get into the detail of this
where all these prices are on this big
website we're going to post that that
data out on your social media
and my social media so that everybody
can see
what the prices are so we're getting the
best deal
make this money go as far as it can for
the students
and the schools make this 50 million
dollars and the other
the other money that the schools are
putting into this go further
we're trying uh we're all pitching in
here
school's going back in a variety of ways
we know that
we've talked about this on the on the
news conferences before
you know when we get into the winter
we're expecting that that this might
this virus might get tough tougher than
it is now so we know
that preparing these students in schools
for the future of potentially having to
do distance learning is important and
these monies have been set aside and
these prices
are now being published publicly so that
we can get the best deals possible and
make sure
that if you have to do distance learning
that you can do distance learning
so with that governor i'll kick it back
to you
look that's very exciting as we all know
the kids
we worry about all our kids we worry
about kids particularly if if school
can't be in person
kids having the ability to get to the
internet uh is so vitally important so
we're excited about this program john
thanks for
for heading heading this up and and
taking the lead in it
we're ready for questions governor your
first question today is from uh
john reed at goneware news service
good afternoon governor um i'm glad
you're doing well
as you know congress is still working on
the next relief package stimulus bill
is there anything in particular that
you've been lobbying to include in that
bill and
would you like to see a further increase
in federal share of medicaid spending
well medicaid spending is is a huge
issue
for us because if things are not changed
there's a cliff out there
that we're going to get to at some point
so yes we like that
medicaid side we want to make sure
you know we have enough funds for the
testing
to get through this uh testing is is not
cheap
uh we're doing everything we can to keep
the cost down we're building up our own
infrastructure in ohio which saves
certainly saves money and and we can
also control it
but the level of our testing needs to go
up even more dramatically than it
already has
so the testing and again the flexibility
flexibility for our local communities
for our local mayors our local counties
and for us is just is just vitally
important so
i'm an optimist i think they'll get
something worked out uh you know
i spent some time in washington i
understand how it works and
sometimes doesn't work uh but uh i i
think something will get worked out
and uh we'll we'll keep moving
you know we also have the other
unemployment extension uh
you know we've got people who are out
there who are really going to be hurting
unless something
some compromise gets worked out and
something gets passed so
thank you our next question is from ben
schwartz at wcpo in cincinnati
good afternoon governor dewine happy to
hear you in good health
um i'm wondering though if you can
comment on the ordeal that you went
through yesterday
and how it makes you think about average
ohioans who have gone
through much more to be tested for covet
19
um it seems like you were in a lucky
position to be able to be
retested and go from a positive test to
negative
in the same day and most ohioans don't
have that luxury
i know you spoke today about progress in
testing but i'd like to know if
yesterday's ordeal
has had much of an effect on how you
view it in the state
well sure no one can go through that
experience without uh
having some impact on you and you know
you think about
uh you know anybody that that goes goes
through that
it's it was a roller coaster yesterday
uh ben the only thing i
i would point out though is that the
majority of ohioans
we don't know the exact number but well
over 90 the test that they got
was the pcr test which is the test i
ended up with at ohio state
uh and so what it does say to me
uh having to you know drill down on the
difference between these two tests
and understand it better is that when we
deploy
uh an antigen test you know we gotta
think long and hard exactly how we're
gonna deploy it uh
and you know it has certain advantages
we know what the advantages are
but we also know the reliability is not
nearly as good uh as as the pcr
test that most ohioans have had so you
know we've entered into an agreement uh
with with maryland and other states to
start looking at this and and but
um it's a conversation frankly i'm gonna
have with governor hogan i
i meant to call him this morning ran out
of time and we'll call him later today
uh you know so you learn look you learn
every experience in life you learn and
so going through that experience
yesterday
pushed my head down right in it and said
hey you know let's look at this
reliability of this test so yeah
our next question is from laura bischoff
at the dayton daily news
uh hey governor um i was wondering if
you could give us an update on the
random sample test that um i think dr
acton talked about maybe as far back as
april this was to check on what
percentage of the population might have
the antibodies
did that ever get off the ground um
it it did it's been another an area of
frustration that didn't move faster uh
laura i don't have that today
but we'll we can get that to you after
the press conference and i'll get it to
everybody
to be available to anybody else in the
press corps
after the press conference we've got
that we can tell you exactly
where exactly that is i just can't do it
now
i don't have it in front of me so thank
you
thank you next question is from jack
windsor at wmfd
in mansfield hi governor uh i'm grateful
for
answered prayers today sir i'm glad
you're well thank you
you're welcome uh lengthy question
please bear with me uh
if i told someone the breaks in a car
may go out thirty to sixty percent of
the time
i don't know many people who would get
in uh if we told someone that an
airplane would experience failure 15 to
20
of the time i don't know anyone who
would get on a flight yet
tests are the vehicle carrying kids into
person schooling
sports and adults to work and business
owners to revenue
yet as yesterday proved antigen tests
have false positives
and if i remember correctly this is the
type of test earlier in the week
we talked about vying to administer in
the future
and according to the knox county
department of health antigen tests can
return
false results 30 to 66 of the time
and pcr tests the one seen as more
reliable can have anywhere from 15 to 20
false results and are so sensitive that
they can
report positives up to three months
after the fact and well after someone is
contagious
yet tests continue to be the primary
driver to public policy
and these faulty tests are putting kids
in compromised learning environments
driving up suicides
drug abuse and depression while wiping
out businesses by the thousands governor
is it simply time to admit that we
bought a lemon and it's causing more
harm
uh this this mechanism than the virus
and is it time to free ohioans so we can
get back to normal life
okay i'm going to reference over to dr
peter moeller who i
believe is still on eric if he's still
on
and i'll just start first of all you
know we didn't choose the test
the antigen test again is not something
that we're
uh using uh this it certainly has not
been so
far part of our overall strategy uh we
have
looked at it uh as a possibility uh in
the future
but the p the standard pcr test is the
gold standard
and you know i will disagree with you at
least but i'm going to let uh
the doctor answer the question in regard
to what the you know
how good how good
he talked about the antigen test but the
pcr test how good that is dr mueller are
you on here
yes sir i'm i'm still on uh you want you
want again kind of give us the
uh you know how accurate is is the pcr
test
as far as we can tell what do you know
what's the data
as well as the and then do the anagen
test sure
sure so absolutely so i think that the
first and foremost that that you know a
year ago we weren't
we weren't testing anything and the
science is moving
incredibly quickly um pcr has been
around for
20 to 30 years and that technology is
is tried and true we know the sequences
of the virus we know the sequences of
specifically of this virus and how it
changes and we've been able to design
these tests so they're almost a hundred
percent
so i would probably challenge you on
your number of your
your accuracy of your your pcr data that
you just brought up
now antigen testing is brand new um
brand new there's two
manufacturers that make it and we're
still learning and i would say
um you know i don't work for the state
um
but but i will tell you that when we're
looking at tests to use for strategies
whether it's here at ohio state
or with my colleagues at other state
universities
we follow the data and before we would
employ something into our testing
strategies
we look exactly at the questions that
you asked you know what is
you know what is the benefit of using
this test what are the risks of using
this test
are we putting people in a false sense
of security by telling them things and
so
those are all areas that we deploy and
there's
not just one person that looks at this
there's hundreds of people that look at
this we look at this in peer-reviewed
literature
and ultimately come to conclusions about
how do we want to change our strategy
and how do we want to evolve i will also
add at the end
is that we continue to work on ways to
improve testing
ways that we can make sure that our pcr
testing is
is expanded so we can include more
numbers ways that we can take an antigen
test
and make it more accurate so all of this
is evolving in real time it's it's
exciting time to be a scientist and but
we need to come up with solutions
where there's data behind them okay
thank you very much thanks jack
our next question is uh from uh
furniture miri at the associated press
hi governor thanks again um for taking
the time today to talk to us
um my question is um i
have spoke actually this morning to the
manufacturer
um who administered the test that you
took yesterday
before you went and met president trump
and they told us that it has a hundred
percent
specificity rate and the fda says it has
a 97
sensitivity rate so according to
those numbers that's as good as pcr so
what are the chances that
the test results that you took yesterday
and afternoon the two tests that you
took
are a false negative well i'm i'm a
biased observer so i'm going to go back
to dr peter muller and let him answer
the question
he's a lot more qualified than i am to
answer the question and i'm the subject
so
i'm probably not very very biased i sort
of like the negative result but
doctor so i obviously can't comment on
the governor's specific case but i will
tell you that
that um if you were to ask a thousand
people that
are in my line of work which is the more
specific and accurate test that all 1000
of them would
would tell you that the pcr test that we
ran last night
is by far more accurate and in fact we
did
we ran it twice so we would ran on a
duplicate
piece of equipment and got the same same
information and so
we we uh we we fully um
stand by the data that we we created
last night
thank you thanks our next question is
from jeff redick at wsyx in columbus
hi governor thanks for the opportunity
even from afar today
uh you mentioned earlier about the
state's equipment for public health
reporting and data and that one of those
is coming up on two decades old which
obviously a computer from
2000 is a lot different than 2020. uh
how did it get
so old why is there no process or is
there
to update this equipment clearly it's
needed and what we have is
underperforming as you said
i think the answer is pretty simple we
have ignored as a people
democrats republicans we've ignored
public health
we've got to stop ignoring public health
this ought to be a real wake-up call for
us
we've got to understand the the role of
public health
uh you know we have people out there and
113 health departments every day and you
never think about them unless something
goes wrong
uh you know they're the ones that are
out there to make sure that we're safe
make sure everything is going right and
what's going right we never think
a thing about it so it is a focus
on public health uh when i hire dr acton
one things i said to her is we've got to
start focusing on public health
had had no idea of course that we were
going to be in
into a pandemic so we got to fix these
systems we got to get them up to date
look we don't we can't even tell you the
health department can't even tell you
today
uh the number of flu deaths that we have
now it's just ridiculous i mean you know
all this data we just got to get better
data
we've got to get it built into the
system
and part of the reason it's difficult
you know is you're relying on
so many in you know decentralized state
like ohio you're
relying not only 113 health departments
you're relying on 88 county coroner's
offices
you're relying on a lot of a lot of
different inputs
and so we've got to design a system
which we will uh for the 21st century
so we we we are in the product we've
done a lot
uh in the last four or five months we
weren't even integrated very well
if at all with the hospitals we're now
integrated so we can show you data up
here
about hospital admissions uh et cetera
so we've come a long way but we we still
have a long way to go
our next question is from joshua
roltenberg at spectrum news
governor glad you're doing well um
question i have for you
it was actually goes back to an earlier
question you were already asked but
talking about your ordeal yesterday
um are you worried just about the
perception of
your results getting back as fast as
possible versus
average ohioans who sometimes have to
wait days and sometimes weeks
and also this my follow-up another
question i have is
if the president is using these antigen
tests which the doctor ranked as the
lowest
is he not getting the best information
himself
for the people that are around him yeah
well first of all
sure i i'm concerned about that
perception
um you know we made a decision that i
was either
as the governor of the state uh going to
be confined uh
here and limited to what i could do uh
for 14 days
uh or we'd try another test uh and so we
we did another test that was based upon
the medical advice
dr andy thomas um and so we got another
test and yes we did get it back quick
um so i i agree with that
um again the vast
majority of ohioans 1.3 million tests
have been run
you know virtually not over 90 of those
are in pcr tests that i had last night
and there would be no reason that i
think medical professionals would doubt
the outcome of that test so the test
that we took
medical professionals they told me we
doubt you know we don't know if that's
accurate
it's probably accurate it's what they
told me it's probably right
but you probably ought to go to the gold
standard let's go get a let's go get the
gold standard test the piece
the pcr our our test
i don't know my understanding is
and i don't know all the facts but the
republican national committee apparently
contracted with somebody to do this
testing
they did the testing i do not
think but i don't know i think what the
white house does at the white house is a
different
test uh but i don't i can't swear to
that but that's what i've been
told that is a different test at the
white house if you go see the president
the white house
my understanding is a more gold standard
test
uh than this test but i'm sure that
enterprising reporters you you guys will
figure that out and
report it i just don't know i don't know
the answer
governor it's john uh houston i got i
got a little report back
from on laura bischoff's question uh
the department of health has completed
their sampling for this
serology testing to determine whether
someone has antibodies
uh that would that would help us
understand better uh how how many people
may have had uh covet 19
that those should have preliminary
results in in a few weeks
with a final report in early september
uh and so we'll be very interested to
see what
what happens there i will i will pers i
will also remind
folks that the american red cross
has been doing these
uh tests when someone donates blood
and the results have
varied from week to week but they are in
the range of 1.4 to 1.8 percent of
people who give blood
who have these antibodies so it's uh
it's a
based on that data it's a small number
of people when you consider it as the
overall population but we will the
department of health will have
those that data back and and have a
report by early september
good lieutenant governor thank you
thank you your next question is from jim
province of the toledo blade
governor it's good to see you could you
give us an idea of what kind of test it
is that the
state has entered a multi-state
purchasing agreement with
is that this california company and is
this test similar
to the one that you took in cleveland
also do we have any idea what kind of
cost is associated with this purchase
we have not entered into any contract
what we've simply done
is gone together as states and
bound together to to work together to be
able to purchase
i think this type test is one of the
tests
that we've been looking at some of our
people have talked to
um both of these companies that do it
uh but as i said earlier uh
you know we dig down further and uh this
is something i'm gonna talk to uh
governor hogan of maryland and the other
governors uh
about and you know again this is
something that
we will rely on the professionals uh
in ohio uh to make it not not just from
the health department but outside the
health department to see
if a test like this you know does it
have a place
and uh you know again looking at this
and looking at
the the false positives and the false
negatives and i'm
an example of one of the false positives
that would appear
certainly would cause us to take a
second look and a third look at this
so we will keep you informed and if
if we get to the point where we're going
to enter into a contract we certainly
will
let you know what the cost is i mean we
are one of the things i
i would just let everybody know uh
this testing is is essential part
of what we do it's not as important
frankly as as
distancing it's not as important wearing
masks but it goes with everything
um we gotta we gotta cut this thing off
and the only way you do it is with
testing and tracing
so we have explored a lot of
possibilities
a lot of different companies
we are in the process of building our
own system
uh so that we quote own more of this
doesn't mean we own the lab but we own
some of the capacity in the lab labs
here in the state of ohio
and the pooling also uh is something
that's uh
that could be a very big game changer so
this is evolving
every single day and we're pushing and
pushing
because we know we're at about 22 000
tests a day now we're averaging that's
not enough
i mean it's double what it was and
triple what it was but it's it's not
enough we got to keep moving
so we'll keep everybody and try to keep
everybody informed what we're doing
our next question is from andy chow at
ohio public radio and television
hi governor a question for you and also
uh for
dr mohler when we're talking about
tests coming back inaccurate is it more
likely for a test to be
false positive or false negative um
and is one more concerning to you than
the other
i'll just say the the false positive was
pretty concerning to me but uh let me
let me talk to
get uh dr mueller on there doctor you
want to take that one
sure so so i think um our goal is
is to to ensure um a few few a few of
either depending on the type of test and
i won't get into too much of the science
some have false positives and some have
false negatives
typically with the antigen test that is
it is typically a false
negative meaning that that you test
negative
and then you have to go back and be
tested again and so i think we
were obviously concerned with with with
with either
and because it it impacts you know
whether it's the inconvenience of having
to
inappropriately you know quarantine for
two weeks
or getting the wrong health information
so i think it's
both are important to us and as the
governor mentioned before
those are the sorts of things that we
think about before we would deploy
massively uh a process i will go back to
the
telescope and binoculars view because it
was brought up one's a good test and
one's a bad test
both are part of a toolbox right and we
may need one
that we can improve to serve a certain
population and the other for another so
it's
it's just really important that we keep
our minds open and continue to innovate
thanks doctor our next question
is from spencer hickey at hannah news
service
thank you and glad to hear your you've
tested
negative governor could you talk about
the president's monday declaration that
national guard duty would be extended
through the end of the year but with
most states picking up 25 percent share
well we're glad to have the extension
obviously we would have wanted the
government
federal government to pay at all but
look the guard has played an integral
role i talked to general harris
every morning about where they're going
what they're doing they played a an
important role in our nursing homes uh
they're
certainly playing an important role out
in our communities so
we're grateful for the extension uh when
we can get the federal government to
pick up three-fourths of the cost uh
that certainly is better than us
taking the full cost uh frankly we'd
already made a decision
uh the federal government was not going
to do that we certainly would have
extended
at least for a while of the guard's
mission because it's so
it's so crucial they have the ability to
go out when we see a hot spot and a
community wants us to come in
they have the ability to go there and i
would just say to any mayors
anybody and county commissioners if
you're looking
any director of health if you think you
do not have enough testing in your
community
and you've got some challenges you know
talk to us talk to the national guard
uh we're happy to come in and do do a
test do testing
uh for for a day so happy to do that
governor our next question is from james
pilcher at
wkrc in cincinnati
good afternoon governor i want to switch
topics for just a second and talk about
evictions
uh evictions are on the rise and now
that the 600 benefit is gone
a lot of people are facing even more
evictions possibly at the end of this
month
some experts say that it's actually
cheaper to keep people in their homes
than a victim
where they'd be more uh apt to rely on
social services
at this point what are you prepared to
do to keep the eviction rate down
and are you prepared to discuss an
eviction moratorium in the state of ohio
well again we're hoping um to see some
action additional action in congress
that would be of some
assistance uh to those individuals we've
all seen the stories you've
reported some of the stories uh of
individuals who
you know cannot make their payment uh
their monthly rental
payment uh so we're looking at it i
don't have anything to announce today
or really to add to it today but it
certainly is a
is a concern to us as we move forward
but we're taking a look at
our next question is from kevin landers
at wbns in columbus
hello governor hi kevin glad to see you
my question is both for the governor and
for the doctor uh did your pcr
results show that you never had covid
and it's i understand that pcr tests
don't provide
either false positives or false
negatives and have you considered using
the rainy day fund to help with
evictions
uh don't know about the last yet we're
still looking looking at it
uh i will refer it to dr mohler
rest the question sure um
so i can't help with the evictions but i
can help with uh the pcr test so the
the testing for pcr is is a snapshot in
time
and so what the test looked at last
night is
the swab that was taken from an
individual
is there rna for the virus on that swab
it doesn't say has he had it three weeks
ago it doesn't say what what an
individual might have two weeks from now
it is a snapshot in time test and is
something that
that again that's a limitation to a test
that we think about of as we plan our
strategy but it is again
a snapshot in time doctor while it's a
snapshot in
time could you elaborate on that a
little bit
because if someone comes down with it uh
on one day
uh and then let's say 10 days later
and is there is there a range in in in
there that we would expect to find
um to get a positive is there any kind
of guidelines for that
sure so so we know that we can detect um
protect the virus with a pcr test
between about one to
about 15 or 20 days one of the things
that we're working on now in the lab is
how active is that virus as you get to
some of those later stages
and so as our tests become more and more
accurate and i will say that for the
for the researchers in the world out
there that no test is a hundred percent
no test is ever going to be 100 but but
pretty darn close
um we're looking to see you know how
early can we can we detect it and then
how far does it go out
and what what we're trying to figure out
governor is maybe
once you get past day 14 or 15
that you can detect virus by pcr but but
maybe it's not as active or maybe you
can't spread it as well so it's there
but it may be dead so those are the
sorts of questions that we're trying to
figure out right now in the lab
okay thank you thank you very much
our next question is from justin dennis
at mahoningmatters.com
good afternoon governor we're glad to
hear you're in good health after
your test results yesterday were
negative along those lines uh we'd like
to know when
the public might have access to such
rapid pcr testing
with results returned within hours
currently they seem reserved for public
officials and well-paid professional
athletes
and i've recently spoken with ohioans
across the state who say people are
still waiting more than a week for
results
um my colleague here at mahoney matters
just this week waited four days
what can you say to those people yeah
what we can say
is we're doing everything we can to
increase the
time look there's we have two challenges
i'd say we collectively
uh as a state uh one is we're not doing
enough tests
and we've got to continue to expand that
out
the second while some tests are coming
back within a day
two days which i think is is reasonable
other tests are taking a lot longer to
come back
some of the tests that are historically
the last few months have been taking the
longest have been
where we have national companies and
they just get backed up
and so somebody enters into a contract
with the national company
they're supposed to get it back in in
two days and they end up getting back in
five days or
back in six days so
it is not a uniform testing
in the state of ohio there's a lot of
different players a lot of different
hospitals and so let me ask dr muller if
he can just
shed some light on what you might be
seeing at ohio state
but also anecdotally maybe what you're
you're hearing from other
uh testing places uh in ohio
again you've got you have some hospitals
are doing testing you've got places like
uc you've got the cleveland clinic
you've got
you you've got uh you've got
dayton children's we've got a lot of
hospitals that are doing testing
uh but we also have some some private uh
national labs they're doing as well
doctor yeah so
i i would say that um you know we have
great partnerships here at ohio state
and patel to work with
all the other labs across the across the
state and in fact
we do a lot of work where we communicate
to
maybe trade some of the tests so we can
ensure rapid turnaround time
one point that we talked about say 20
minutes ago was this idea of pool
testing
pool testing is going to be absolutely
key
to being able to increase our turnaround
time or in fact decrease our turnaround
time and so
that would be something that that would
be fun to continue to talk about
but but some of the modeling that we
look at that where you're able to
combine
one in five or even one in ten samples
is going to be able to decrease
not only turnaround time but but really
the cost
as well as some of these issues with
with uh
with reagent supply
and again uh doctor one of the things
we've seen
you just referenced is reagents
some of frankly some of the labs in the
state of ohio are being kind of
strangled if i could use that term
uh because the people who are they have
uh
uh their machines and they're sending in
the reagent and they
need to be sending the reagent to
florida or texas or somewhere else
and so they're rationing so our labs
many of our labs are being
literally rationed that's why we're
constantly looking
for other opportunities i just got a
call about another
possible opportunity right before i came
on
on the air here so if you want to add
anything to that doctor
or not no i i'd say the only thing that
we continue to work with
the cdc and the fda across the state
labs to figure out if there's ways that
we can continue
to to expand our equipment and and
reagent pool
and in fact we have a project now that
we're working on the fda with is to
to be able to allow us to use some of
the not so fancy telescopes
that might be in college or university
labs that they're using for teaching or
using for
some very basic research and redeploy
those to be able to test and those
those conversations are very active and
will
again help our our supply chain and
turnaround times
and those conversations doctor i find
very exciting
um we'll have to see how this this pans
out but this has
great possibilities not just for ohio
state but for
many many other universities and some
even
not so not so big in the state of ohio
who have laboratories and that you know
we might be able to
deploy them in this in this battle in
this war so
it's very very exciting again that was
one of the things that we were
discussing
when dr burks was out a couple weeks ago
we discussed that with her and i know
that
ohio state has been been looking at that
for some time
your next question is from dave sess at
wkbn in youngstown hey governor how has
this experience influenced how you
consider health orders whether it be
towards schools
churches bars or even ohioans
well i think from a personal
point of view um you know being informed
yesterday about 11 o'clock that i had
the coven it does center your attention
and it focuses your attention
and you know i've studied this enough
i'm not expert i'm not doctor i'm not a
scientist
but you sort of know what your odds are
um and even for 73 year old the odds are
pretty good
but the wrist level obviously has gone
goes up because of age because of the
fact that
you know i have asthma so yeah it
focuses your attention
uh and it you know my attention has been
focused on this but i think when it
becomes personal
um you know you you think about it and
you think of
i think you understand better i
understood better
how other people feel when they're told
they have covet uh and when they're told
you know hey this is what you got to do
uh this is what may happen
um yeah it's uh yeah i think it
it it brings home the gravity of it
in a very very very personal way
next question is from adrian robbins at
wcmh in columbus
hi governor thank you again for being
here and i'm glad to hear that you're
doing well
um the white house continues to worry
about these new kind of outbreaks we're
seeing in rural areas
earlier this week they even brought up
ohio as an example of these outbreaks
you also sound like you're concerned
about this what are your experts saying
about this kind of spread in rural ohio
and what can be done to combat it
yeah i mean what the experts are saying
dr burks who was in here as i said a
couple weeks ago
uh and what we're seeing in some other
states is this spread
in into rural areas is not unique to
ohio first of all
the fall excuse me the spring march
onward or many rural areas
felt like they were untouched they may
have had some cases but
no but you know you didn't know very
much if you lived there you probably
didn't know anybody that had
had it or certainly no one had died from
it
that's not going to be what is happening
it's not what's happening now in ohio
uh you know we're into a very different
spread
it's a deeper spread it's a more
comprehensive
spread it is out into our rural areas in
the rural areas who are yellow
counties that were yellow on that map
you know they got to fight hard to stay
yellow because
it's we've seen so many of the yellow
counties over the last few weeks turn
orange so it's a real battle but it
comes back to basics
uh it comes back to distance
mask sanitation be careful
i mean it just comes back back to basics
and the people in the counties that were
worried about those top ten counties uh
you know
they have it within their own control i
mean we've told their local health
department whatever you need we're going
to give to you
what do you need from us but the most
important thing that can happen
is for people in those counties to put
masks on when they go out in public
to keep a distance to understand when
they're celebrating a happy event or
or in sorrow in a funeral that
their lives are still at risk and you
know even though they're among friends
even though they're among family that
because so many people
have no symptoms but are carrying the
virus
you know they got to be careful no
matter who they're around
and so that's what will stop it in the
rural areas
the people in the rural areas can
control it i'll say this you know the
most
in rural areas most schools are planning
on going back in person
how long those schools are able to go
back in person
will be determined by not only what
school officials do and i am
every confidence that they're going to
do a great job but it's also what the
people in the community do and how much
community spread there is because when
there is community spread you cannot
keep it out of your school
because kids are going in there and
they're mixing with other kids and it
just
it's a accelerator uh and you see
you you're going to see the spread more
so if we want our schools
to stay open we want to be able to go in
person which is what we
want to see for our kids um
the community has got to look at wearing
a mask as
a direct impact on how long that school
stays open
and how long the football team is able
to play and how long the band is able to
play
and how how long all the other things
that we want to do connected with our
schools is able
to take place it is a direct connection
it is a direct connection and so i just
would appeal to all my friends
uh you know wherever you live in ohio
what you do is going to determine you
know how long the kids are in school
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
hi governor glad to see you're doing
well today um
but given yesterday's covid scare what
kind of
protocols are in place if you were to
become seriously ill with the virus
how would some of these decisions around
you know health orders and other things
get made
i would make the decisions as long as i
could uh if i got to the point where i
could not make the decisions and i
uh i will know i'll guarantee you
then lieutenant governor uh
john houston is in charge whether i'm
making the decisions or john is making
the decisions we have a
a stellar team around us
it's a team that's been with me many
many years at the top
top level these are people i implicitly
trust
some of them were with me in the united
states senate been with me
ag's office with me now
so we have a very very good team we have
people outside the administration that
we consult all the time
so you know this is not a case where
the lieutenant governor you know is
sitting over here and uh
he does a little something that's not
the case at all this lieutenant governor
is involved in virtually every decision
we make
uh very very much so uh adds a great
deal
i'm very lucky to have him so i think
people the state couldn't feel confident
that something happens to me the state
will move forward
our next question is from john london at
wlwt
in cincinnati
governor i know you just talked about
schools just a second ago but
reopening them remains very high
interest and very controversial
maybe more so since the mass mandate for
all students
i'm wondering what a successful school
year looks like
for you and is there a threshold where
you'd order schools
closed again and if so would that be
district by district or
or a statewide blanket well john i think
it depends on the facts this is all
going to be fact driven
uh yes you're right it's been it was
controversial i've talked to a lot of
people
about the mandatory mask order again
there are exceptions
and if someone can't wear them that's
fine
and they should not you know be
criticized in any way that's fine
but every health professional i have
talked to
every doctor who i've talked to said the
wearing of masks in school
not only can take place at a young age
but should take place
at a young age i trust the teachers the
teachers will figure this out
if there's some reason a child can't
work that's going to be okay
if the teacher is having if a child is
having problems
that's okay teachers will work it out i
trust our teachers to do that
but i said at the time uh our
chance of getting through school getting
school open
kids physically there and keeping that
going for for an
extended period of time um is going to
be in a direct relationship to two
things
one what's going on inside that school
and are the students wearing masks and
are they social distancing and is
everybody doing what they
need to do the picture we saw coming out
of georgia for example is
not what we want to see and i i trust
that you will not see a picture like
that coming out of ohio
where everybody was crowded together in
a hallway and no one would seem to be
wearing a mask
so that's one two is what happens to the
community
the community is going to control the
future a lot because you cannot separate
the community from the school
and the spread that goes on the
community will be in that school
and you can pretty much mathematically
figure out what it what it is
in fact there's a you can go up on a web
page and look at some projections
uh so what we do in the community what
we do in school
uh and look uh the first people who are
gonna know there's a problem in a school
are the people in that school
uh and i you know just as schools get
close during the school year
if there's flu you know if there's
covid and flu covered
you're going to see school systems make
those decisions
they're going to make them on the spot
they're going to make them in the best
interest
of the people the community and i i
trust them to do that
could there come a time when it is so
bad
uh that and so dangerous that yeah we
think we have to close
you know schools in one area of the
state or schools in
in uh the whole state well i suppose
that's a possibility but let's let's
don't
we're not going to get there until we
get we see what the facts are
um you know this virus has a mind of its
own we have no idea
how it's going to progress there seems
to be a consensus at least in the
national experts that i've talked to
that would indicate that
november december january could be tough
could be tough i mean our first hurdle
is going to be going back to school
we are now down to about 5.5 percent
statewide positivity
higher than we would like lower than it
was
three weeks ago when it's 6.5 so we're
not going in
at a real high level but we're certainly
not going into the low level we wish we
were starting going back to school at a
lower level
but we're not it is what it is today uh
but again i would plead with everyone
out there we've got a couple weeks from
most
most areas of the state before school
starts do everything you can
drive these numbers down slow this thing
down because when school starts
we're going to see naturally we would
expect to see
an uptick now if everyone wears masks uh
for everyone's social distances
uh and if in times when school's out
people are
are focused on it yeah we can we can
slow this down immensely
so done we're just going to take it day
at a time
we're going to keep in touch with what's
going on in our schools and uh
but the first line of defense is going
to be out there with those
superintendents as
school boards those principals and and
those teachers
next question is from molly coweek at
whio in dayton
hi governor you had two different types
of tests an antigen
and a pcr but you of course got
different results says the
state track its testing data by
separating it by the type of test
and how can ohioans feel competent with
the data that's being released daily
they can feel confident and dab that's
released daily because that
is uh fundamentally the pcr
data as we said we think about 1.3
million ohioans
uh 1.3 million tests have been done
and those are the pcr tests the vast
majority of those
are there is a breakout on
our web page we looked at that frankly
a little more carefully
i looked at maybe a little more
carefully it looks like
the second section which is the non-pcr
probably needs to be broken out better
so we're
working on that but the key factor is
if you're watching this and you've had a
test in ohio the odds are very very
heavy it was pcr test which is state of
the art
and that's what you had
thank you our next question
is from jake zuckerman at the ohio
capitol
journal
we will come back to jake our next
question is from jesse ballmer
at the uh cincinnati inquirer
hi thanks my question i guess is about
the ohio department of health data that
is some of which is in a system that's
19 years old i guess what's the first
step
into improving that system and how
difficult will that be with the state's
current financial
situation amid coronavirus well look
we're going to do what we have to do
the problem is we're also in the middle
of a pandemic
and it's all hands on deck now to deal
with the pandemic
so we know
that to fix this system it's probably to
permanently fix it to get a new system
start with that
to get a new system it's going to take
longer than this pandemic we hope lasts
uh so but that's that's what we're gonna
that's what we're gonna strive for we're
gonna do it right
look we're going to have other things
that we need to track we hope we don't
have
anything like this for another 100 years
but
we don't know that we have to we have to
be prepared so yeah we'll invest what we
need to invest
because this is essential it's an area
that frankly has been under invested in
do we have uh jake zuckerman from ohio
capitol journal
am i coming through here okay
governor sorry about that uh ohio tested
about 22
000 people per day in july and the ohio
department of health told the federal
government it plans to pcr test just
about 24 000 people per day in august
so the growth is pretty modest there
we're about seven months into this
pandemic
why is ohio still failing to scale up
its testing and
what are the choke yeah we are
we're not failing to scale up our
testing we've scaled it up
that's one second when i saw
what our department they told me what
they're reporting i said
that's not acceptable i said you can
send that in
but that's not what our goal is so that
is not acceptable those numbers are
simply not acceptable now let's look at
the big the big picture
new virus health departments
not had invested in health departments
not invested in
in the testing so this thing started
basically from
from zero when this pandemic
hit we have
fortunately never been a state that's
been tops
or even in the top third i don't think
uh we controlled it
going in uh we're controlling it coming
out not as well as we like
but we are controlling it and we're not
a hot spot
we never were new york god love them
we never were florida we never were
texas
but what that has meant is that we've
never been a priority
um very understandably when the federal
government makes decisions about
allocation and they they indicate two
different
different companies we're never a
priority uh now we've got good
cooperation from the federal government
good
cooperation with trump uh administration
but we're never a priority and that's
good in the sense that we never were
that bad uh
so that's one of the one of the things
we've not ever been
on fire here in ohio and we don't want
to be on fire
second you know we have worked
to increase the capacity uh we have
we there's no testing system in ohio
we have a whole bunch of labs and what
we have tried to do
is do a couple things one is we've gone
out on the market
and bought lab capacity from vent from
companies
uh and at the same time we've we have
been building up our own system we've
got a couple things that we're very
excited about we're building up what we
call our central lab which is not just
in one place but it's
in other labs we have a working
relationship for example with dayton
children's hospital
and they have taken part of their
facilities in middletown and turned it
in
turning it now into a lab so uh that
figure that you
you quoted early on uh you know my goal
is to
certainly exceed that and keep moving so
uh eric has given me the sign we are
ready to get off so i want to thank
everybody
very very much and we look forward to
seeing you back
on tuesday uh fray and i will get these
tests tomorrow we'll report those tests
out
in a news release as soon as we have
results from tomorrow
have a good weekend everybody thank you
