hear ye hear ye the honorable supreme
court of ohio is now an open session
pursuant to adjournment
you may be seated good morning everyone
welcome to the portrait dedication for
terence o'donnell
the 140 justice of the supreme court of
ohio
as you can see we're doing things much
differently for this portrait dedication
than we've done in the past and of
course that is due to our current global
pandemic
during a normal time the courtroom would
be filled and justice o'donnell
along with friends family and colleagues
would be here in the courtroom with me
knowing him as i do we'd be listening to
the cleveland pipe and drum corps
pipe us in with their bagpipes wearing
kilts
but current social distancing rules make
that impossible i'm afraid
in his absence three of his children and
three of his grandchildren are here with
us today to help
unveil the portrait and i'm grateful
that the o'donnell name is well
represented
unveiling ceremony the unveiling
ceremony we're holding today is of huge
importance terry was an incredible force
on the court for 15 years
he joined the court a few months after i
did in 2003.
looking back i'm sure tod as i call him
would agree that it was a very special
error
i'm referring to the incredible
experience of working with the late
chief justice tom moyer
we saw firsthand firsthand how humble
and accessible tom was
what a mild-mannered chief could
accomplish because he had an incredible
ability
to work with people the moyer court was
collegial
and while we worked hard we also enjoyed
socializing on tuesday evenings with
group dinners
while chief justice moyer created the
supreme court's commission on
professionalism it was terry who not
only served on the commission
but also tirelessly supported its work
he was instrumental in the creation of
the lawyer to lawyer mentoring program
it was one of the most impressive
mentoring programs in the nation
it began in 2006 as a pilot and became a
permanent program in 2008
pairing experienced lawyers with newly
minted attorneys for one year
helping with the transition from law
school to practicing attorney
it's an excellent program that not only
benefits the new lawyer
but the mentors say they learn and grow
along with their mentees
that is a legacy that justice o'donnell
should be very very proud of
justice o'donnell has also had the
unique distinction of having worked on
in all three buildings that have been
the home of the
supreme court of ohio when he was amir
spratt he clerked for justice corrigan
when the court was housed in the ohio
state house
annex our former site up until 2004
was the third floor of the rhodes tower
and here
in the thomas j moyer ohio judicial
center which we've occupied since 2004.
justice o'donnell also served as
chairman of the ohio legal rights
services commission which oversees the
protection and advocacy
of the developmentally disabled and
mentally ill statewide
he was a past member of the board of
trustees of our lady of the wayside
a non-profit organization dedicated to
serving the needs of the mentally and
physically challenged
where his brother john o'donnell lived
for 10 years until he passed away in
2011.
one of his most notable accomplishments
is his position of director emeritus of
the st
patrick's day parade in cleveland rain
sleet or snow couldn't stop terry or the
parade
justice o'donnell is a man who is
devoted to his family
his profession his community his
heritage
and his religion now it is my pleasure
to introduce father hugh
mcgigan he is the pastor of our lady of
light
community in fort myers florida he will
deliver this morning's invocation
good morning it is a great pleasure that
i come before you this day
to give this invocation and honor our
very good friend
justice o'donnell who asked this
of us this day that we come before our
god
and we pray his blessing
almighty ever-living god whose hand lies
every human heart
and the rights of your people look we
favor
we pray on justice o'donnell
today who governed with this body
and governed with authority we pray
that your people who prospered
under his leadership he assured each and
every one of us our peace
and our freedoms may your gift
come upon him this day dear lord in
security
in your name we pray thank you father
i also have the honor today of
introducing former justice and current
speaker of the house robert cupp who
will deliver brief remarks
it is an honor for me to offer a few
remarks
for the dedication of justice terrence
o'donnell's supreme court portrait
today and because justice o'donnell
values brevity
he has allotted to me just a few minutes
to offer observations and
so i will be concise justice o'donnell
cherished being a judge and the work of
a judge
it has been his element his passion his
professional calling
nearly 16 years of service on ohio's
highest court
was informed by prior 14 years as a
common police trial
court judge eight years as a district
court of appeals judge
and a keen legal mind he set an example
as an exemplary jurist who not only
honored
the separation of powers enshrined in
the three-branch structure
of our state and national constitutions
in theory
but faithfully observed it in practice
in his decisions
and written opinions justice donald also
had a passion to instill
greater public respect for the legal
profession
as an essential and noble calling
ultimately
this led to the creation of the supreme
court's lawyer to lawyer mentoring
program
pairing experienced lawyers with newly
admitted lawyers
as a way of passing on the best legal
practices
and the highest ethical standards to
succeeding generations of lawyers
justice o'donnell's dedicated work in
this resulted in the program being
recognized
as one of the best in the nation his
respect for tradition
is illustrated by an item he kept in his
supreme court chambers
at the beginning of his legal career
terry o'donnell
worked as a law clerk for then justice
j.j p corrigan
who served as a mentor to him and was a
continued influence throughout his
career
justice o'donnell was able to later
acquire the now
antique desk of his mentor and it held a
place of honor in his chambers
and served as a treasured inspiration
with justice o'donnell would explain to
those
who visit his chambers as a colleague
terry could not have been more welcoming
and helpful to me
when i arrived as a new member of the
court always proactively checking to see
that i knew what i should know
about the workings of the court its
protocols etiquette
and informal expectations willingly
sharing
techniques he had used for years to get
through massive stacks of briefs
and opinion drafts he was himself a
wonderful mentor
as a supreme court justice i would
sometimes study
the portraits of former justices that
were displayed in the hallways and rooms
of the court
and i noted the variations in the old
justice's physical features
hairstyles clothes and facial
expressions
and i often wondered what in life their
personalities
were like but through their likeness
frozen in time alone
one cannot know so here are a few things
that posterity should know
about the real life justice o'donnell's
personality
first of course he looks like a judge
right out of central casting
white hair gleaming eyes that are
perceptive and knowing
and a facial expression serious and
thoughtful
when on the bench or pondering weighty
legal questions
that would be justice o'donnell but
there is more
when he was not immersed in serious
contemplation or
writing an opinion or dissent he was
friendly
and outgoing and jovial he would make a
point of greeting court staff
no matter if he was headed to a court
meeting in mid-conversation with another
justice
walking with his own staff or escorting
a guest around the court
and even when the conversation was
serious he could lighten the room with a
well-placed
good-natured quip which he enjoyed
telling
and during our years on the court
together we often traveled the state and
attended the same meetings
or events and when he speaks to a group
there is always an urgency in his voice
that draws the listener in
whether explaining how the court decides
to accept the case for review
or how he views the role of a judge or
the limits of judicial authority
and then with an irish twinkle in his
eye a broad smile on his face and yes
his
white judicial hair gleaming he would
relate a humorous story and have
everyone laughing
and enjoying a fun laugh a hard act to
follow
for sure and that would also be justice
o'donnell
friend mentor conversationalist
highly capable and worthy lawyer judge
and supreme court justice
justice terrence o'donnell may your
portrait
as the 149th justice of the supreme
court of ohio
continue to honor your significant
contributions
to the great body of ohio law and to the
history
of this great court

going to invite

justice
terry o'donnell who will share a few
remarks
it is a distinct privilege to be able to
present a portrait
to the ohio supreme court albeit by
recording
due to the culvert 19 pandemic i still
consider it
a rare privilege and the opportunity to
do so
only being afforded to members who have
served as justices
on the supreme court of the state of
ohio i had that privilege really due to
the volunteer efforts of hundreds of
people across the state of ohio
to help me win elections so i could
maintain my service on the court
i'm indebted to judges all across the
state of ohio
and public officials especially people
like governor bob taft
and brian hicks his chief of staff
bob bennett chairman of the ohio
republican party
joanne davidson cares and a host of
others
all of whom helped me earn this position
on the court
i am so proud to have had the
opportunity to work with chief justice
tom moyer
tom served as chief for the supreme
court
for a period of 24 years he was humble
he was powerful and he was quiet
tom knew how to get things done he was
an effective
tourist judges from all over the state
would come to him with problems or
issues
and he would carefully listen and make a
decision
they'd leave knowing that they had their
case heard
their problem resolved and they all
trusted what tom would do
in resolving issues that would come
before him as chief justice
i learned a lot from tom he didn't even
know he was a teacher
but i've tried to emulate both his
temperament
and demeanor in the service that i've
afforded
as a member of the supreme court i'm
grateful today to father hugh mcquikman
from our lady of light parish in estero
florida
father i want to thank you for your very
kind words uh
offered today in the uh invitation and
benediction

serving with then justice
bob cupp who is now seeker of the house
of representatives
one day bob will have the opportunity to
present a portrait to this court
and a unique opportunity to present one
to the house of representatives
due to his legislative role bob is a
competent
uh public servant and his integrity
and judgment and patience will serve him
well
in his role as speaker of the house of
representatives
i'm also very grateful that bob decided
not to tell the whole truth
in his comments made this afternoon
i'm grateful to all my colleagues on the
supreme court
and for the opportunities i've had to
share and exchange
ideas and views on various cases over
the years
i'm especially grateful to chief justice
o'connor

on the supreme court

talents of leslie adams

is really deserving finally i want to
comment about
