    "is committed a warrant is issued that",
    "that warrant goes",
    "into the national database as well as",
    "the state",
    "database in october we unveiled strong",
    "ohio",
    "a reasonable and aggressive package of",
    "legislation designed to protect the",
    "rights of ohio's law-abiding citizens",
    "part of that bill as what i just",
    "mentioned that requirement that",
    "there's an outstanding warrant for a",
    "dangerous individual that must be",
    "entered into the national",
    "database our bill would better protect",
    "our citizens from those with a",
    "propensity towards violence",
    "it would better ensure that those who",
    "are danger to themselves",
    "or to others get help",
    "and also it better prevents the sale of",
    "guns to those who",
    "are prohibited from owning them",
    "today one year since the shooting one",
    "year to the date since the shooting",
    "took place that prompted our strong",
    "ohio bill sadly",
    "ohio's laws are exactly where they were",
    "a year ago",
    "ohioans are saying to the state",
    "legislature",
    "do something i'm calling on the general",
    "assembly",
    "to advance the strong ohio bill",
    "we must not let the deaths of these nine",

    "nor can we continue to ignore the fact",
    "that we have a generation of young",
    "people who have been murdered on the",
    "streets",
    "of our cities on a daily basis",
    "this brings me to another part of the",
    "strong ohio bill a part that sometimes",
    "forgotten or ignored and that is",
    "gun violence that occurs on our streets",
    "every day in ohio predominantly not",
    "exclusively",
    "predominantly in our major cities",
    "we went back and looked at the figures",
    "for this year",
    "in ohio's eight largest cities in the",
    "first half of this year",
    "homicides have increased by a total of",
    "27 percent",
    "as compared to the same time period last",
    "year",
    "this year 246",
    "of our fellow citizens have been",
    "murdered",
    "most of them by guns in our major",
    "cities more than 80 percent of the",
    "victims",
    "were african-americans all were victims",
    "all had a right to live",
    "most of the individuals we know from",
    "talking to chiefs of police and from",
    "past experience",
    "that most of these individuals who",
    "committed these crimes",
    "did it with a gun and most of them had",
    "no",
    "legal ability to own that gun",
    "our strong ohio bill will impact",
    "this in a number of ways one way",
    "um is as follows",
    "this bill will increase the penalty",
    "for repeat violent offenders who use a",
    "gun",
    "in the commission of a felony or who are",
    "found in possession of a gun",
    "this is something that chiefs of police",
    "and our major cities have been asking",
    "for",
    "for a number of years we asked the",
    "legislature",
    "please pass this along with the rest of",
    "strong ohio",
    "we simply cannot continue to let this",
    "bill languish while people continue to",
    "die",
    "doing nothing doing nothing",
    "is simply not an option",
    "eric let's go to our data slides real",
    "quickly",
    "21 day average and you'll see the",
    "the numbers uh are cases um",
    "you can see what's happened with our",
    "cases in the last 21 days",
    "um yesterday 1143 cases",
    "this this number has been hovering",
    "somewhere between 1100 and 1500",

    "deaths",
    "tragically 31 individuals",
    "hospitalizations",
    "are up based on the 21 day average",

    "i want to talk now about our our schools",

    "students school administrators teachers",
    "superintendents all are",
    "thinking about going back to school and",
    "the schools are making",

    "decisions about",
    "how to go back to school",
    "and i know that there is a great deal of",
    "frustration",
    "among ohio citizens today because of the",
    "uncertainty",
    "the lack of certainty",
    "this weekend i spent some time talking",
    "to scientists",
    "around the country about the pandemic",
    "one scientist told me this weekend and i",
    "quote this virus",
    "does not operate on our schedule",
    "everyone i think feels frustrated by the",
    "uncertainty of what",
    "is ahead i certainly share",
    "that frustration none of us has a",
    "crystal ball none of us can tell",
    "what's going to happen when we go back",
    "to school",
    "we all are trying to bring certainty to",
    "something",
    "that quite candidly we cannot be certain",
    "about",
    "and that is what's going on with the",
    "virus",
    "we've never been here before no ohio has",
    "faced this for 100 years",
    "we've not done this before",
    "we cannot know what the next three weeks",
    "will bring",
    "let alone the next three months or six",
    "months",
    "or nine months of school",
    "each school district in this state faces",
    "a different reality",
    "because each school district is in a",
    "different",
    "place different place because of their",
    "buildings",
    "different place because of what's going",
    "on in the community",
    "a different place because of the",
    "community spread",
    "that they have and how great that",
    "spread is the reality",
    "is and what scientists continue to to",
    "tell me",
    "medical experts continue to tell me when",
    "we ask about schools we talk about",
    "schools we try to get some certainty or",
    "some",
    "ability to predict what's going on what",
    "i'm told",
    "is that the community spread",
    "in that community will be reflected",
    "uh in in that school because it just",
    "makes common sense",
    "so there's really two variables one is",
    "what the community spread is",
    "and the other is what of course goes on",
    "within the school",
    "as we go forward the community spread",
    "may change we've seen this with numbers",
    "that we have we have shared with you and",
    "we continue to try to",
    "keep you up to date about what's going",
    "on in in your community",
    "and when the community spread changes uh",
    "the school reality will change with it",
    "we try to come up with the best",
    "information that we can",
    "to help provide parents who are making",
    "decisions",
    "superintendents who are making decisions",
    "and others",
    "about what's going on in your community",
    "we've done a color code map the color",
    "code map",
    "eric is going to put up here in a moment",
    "this is",
    "the one we used last week we will change",
    "this again on thursday we do not have",
    "the new data computed",
    "but this is gives people an idea of what",
    "a general idea at least of what is going",
    "on in their community and what",
    "what the trends are we also have do we",
    "have the other slide too",
    "eric i've asked our team to",
    "come up with another way of looking at",
    "this",
    "and this will make this available",
    "this is a ranking of counties and this",
    "will change all the time",
    "but it tries to give some idea of what",
    "is going on in the last two weeks",
    "so it's not historical data it's not",
    "going back it is",
    "what one way of looking at how community",
    "spread is",
    "in that particular community in the last",
    "two",
    "weeks and so you get some kind of",
    "interesting",
    "things i'll see how good my eyes are but",
    "uh what we have tried to do here what we",
    "have done here i've asked our or people",
    "who do the statistics of the department",
    "of health and thank them for doing this",
    "but what we're doing here is ranking all",
    "88 counties",
    "based upon in order based upon the",
    "number",
    "of cases",
    "that they've had in the last two weeks",
    "but we want to compare apples to apples",
    "and so what we have done is",
    "translated those numbers into a hundred",
    "thousand population",
    "so what you will see is you know some",
    "surprises i think",
    "um about and again this is only for the",
    "last two weeks",
    "next two weeks may change but it sort of",
    "tells you",
    "where things are going uh and eric i'm",
    "gonna walk over here so i can",
    "take a look at this a little better",
    "but you'll see we start off",
    "at least for the last two at least for",
    "the last two weeks with the county that",
    "has the highest number",
    "per hundred thousand uh and that's that",
    "would be i think a shock to most people",
    "that mean mercer county",
    "um small county western ohio",
    "the next highest is lucas wyandotte",
    "and franklin hancock champaign fairfield",
    "ottawa",
    "montgomery and on down again it's it is",
    "simply one way of looking at this",
    "but what it tells us is what what the",
    "spread is",
    "uh what the spread is in the community",
    "at a particular point in time and that",
    "is the last the last two weeks",
    "it does not replace the",
    "color code color code has a lot of",
    "indicators",
    "and the color code is more future",
    "looking uh",
    "than this but when people are making",
    "decisions and",
    "i'm not telling them how to make",
    "decisions",
    "or what decisions to make but there's a",
    "lot of data out there",
    "and i think what we know",
    "is we all can impact",
    "the school situation",
    "our teachers our administrators",
    "have worked very hard to prepare for the",
    "school year and to make it as safe as",
    "they can within the school itself but",
    "it's incumbent upon us",
    "to make sort of the sea that we all are",
    "swimming in",
    "as safe as we can and what is going on",
    "in the community",
    "as far as community spread will be",
    "directly",
    "impacted will directly impact what is",
    "going on",
    "in that school because those kids are",
    "obviously coming out of",
    "of that universe and if you see commute",
    "widespread communities spread you will",
    "in all likelihood see widespread uh",
    "spread within that within that school",
    "um look we all have different goals for",
    "our kids",
    "and our grandkids and teachers have the",
    "goals administrators and mostly",
    "but more than anybody else's parents we",
    "all do",
    "if we're gonna whatever those goals are",
    "whatever goals you have for your",
    "children",
    "if we're going to achieve those we have",
    "got to",
    "deal with the community spread community",
    "spread",
    "is in fact everywhere as you can see by",
    "this chart",
    "with the chart we had up a moment ago",
    "and these are the these are the the",
    "top-ranked ones that eric now has put up",
    "here",
    "uh but take a look at all of them you",
    "can see kind of where your county",
    "uh come comes in",
    "but the community spread will determine",
    "how well we do",
    "uh how well with if we start back in",
    "school can we stay in school",
    "uh if you start virtual will you be able",
    "to move to",
    "to in person all that is going to depend",
    "on community spread um",
    "we told the schools early on uh you got",
    "to be flexible",
    "uh and so they all have have come back",
    "with with different plans",
    "uh and again this this virus um",
    "you know has a mind of its own and so we",
    "have to be flexible but we can",
    "impact uh what that future what that",
    "future will",
    "will bring again two real variables",
    "community spread plus what is inside the",
    "school and what's going on in the school",
    "so let me move to",
    "that as you know a few weeks ago",
    "we gave broad guidance from the health",
    "department and department of education",
    "to all our 630-some school districts",
    "throughout the state of ohio and there",
    "really weren't a lot of probably a lot",
    "of surprises in there",
    "the only real mandate that we put in",
    "there uh was that",
    "as is true with every other company or",
    "business",
    "in the state uh anything else everybody",
    "who works there has to wear a mask and",
    "that was a part of the requirement",
    "and that was consistent with what we had",
    "done what we had done before",
    "and that's what that previous order",
    "we're going to add today",
    "an additional order and we're doing it",
    "to frankly give our children our",
    "teachers",
    "the best chance to succeed the best",
    "chance for whatever dreams you have for",
    "your child",
    "whatever goals you have for your child",
    "this academic year we are doing this",
    "so that child has the best possibility",
    "of achieving",
    "those goals our goal must be to give a",
    "safe environment for our children",
    "safe environment for our teachers a safe",
    "environment for the custodians",
    "people who work in the office people who",
    "work in the cafeteria",
    "any adult who works there and all the",
    "kids we want them to have as safe an",
    "environment as as possible doctors",
    "now advise that",
    "children k through 12 should wear a mask",
    "let me add to that",
    "just this morning and i actually talked",
    "to them at seven this morning",
    "on a conference call the ohio children's",
    "hospital association and the ohio",
    "chapter of the american academy of",
    "pediatrics",
    "jointly now recommend mass for all",
    "children returning to school",
    "and here is a portion of the letter they",
    "wrote in support of the mask and this is",
    "actually the letter",
    "itself and i will read from",
    "a portion of this letter ohio children's",
    "hospital association",
    "supports the american academy of",
    "pediatrics and the centers for disease",
    "control and prevention's guidelines",
    "for children's use of face coverings and",
    "masks",
    "the ohio children's hospital association",
    "recommends all children",
    "were face coverings masked when",
    "returning to school consistent with",
    "american academy of pediatrics",
    "and cdc guidelines and specifically",
    "children",
    "in grades k-12 with the following",
    "exemptions and the first is children",
    "under the age of two",
    "obviously it does not apply it's not",
    "relevant to to",
    "k through 12. number two any child",
    "unable to remove the face covering",
    "without assistance",
    "number three exception a child with",
    "significant behavioral psychological",
    "issues",
    "undergoing treatment that is exacerbated",
    "specifically by the use of a facial",
    "covering eg",
    "severe anxiety or a tactile aversion",
    "or a child living with severe autism or",
    "with extreme developmental delays who",
    "may become",
    "agitated or anxious wearing a mask and",
    "five a child with a facial deformity",
    "that causes airway obstruction",
    "um so that is going to be",
    "the policy uh we are going to to make",
    "that",
    "an order from the health department uh i",
    "have great confidence that the teachers",
    "uh will work this out with with kids uh",
    "but that this is what the norm",
    "uh should be as you can see with the",
    "exceptions if a child has a reason for",
    "not wearing that",
    "obviously that child needs to be",
    "accommodated",
    "and everyone needs to respect that child",
    "so that's the important thing as we move",
    "as we move forward frankly",
    "this gives us the best shot that we can",
    "along with the other things that schools",
    "are doing",
    "which is keeping the distance uh the",
    "separation",
    "working on that and added to that",
    "the other things that they're doing in",
    "regard to sanitation",
    "gives us the best shot that we have",
    "frankly to be able to have children",
    "in in school",
    "let's talk a moment about the mass we're",
    "working with the federal emergency",
    "management",
    "fema to distribute 2 million mass to",
    "schools for use by students and staff",
    "we'll deliver these to the regional",
    "education service centers who are",
    "serving as our distribution partner",
    "i'd like to thank them and fema for",
    "their partnership as we try to make sure",
    "schools and families",
    "have access to the resources they need",
    "to plan for the coming",
    "school year let me continue",
    "in regard to schools on another related",
    "topic and that is sports let me just",
    "talk for a moment then i'm going to",
    "throw it over to the lieutenant governor",
    "from personal experience all eight of",
    "our children",
    "have been involved in sports in school",
    "our grandchildren",
    "those who are old enough to go to school",
    "have been involved in sports",
    "we understand uh how very very important",
    "sports",
    "uh is is to children um and we all could",
    "go through the list",
    "uh of and john and i've talked about",
    "this a lot uh",
    "and fran and i've talked about it about",
    "all the things that sports brings",
    "a couple that come to mind i wrote down",
    "this morning self-discipline",
    "no substitute for that self-discipline",
    "which will",
    "bode well for that child throughout",
    "their whole their whole life",
    "but developing that self-discipline",
    "working for a cause bigger than oneself",
    "working on a team",
    "you learn that you learn how to be not",
    "selfish",
    "but pull for the whole team and work for",
    "that team that's a that's a",
    "great lesson um sports brings order and",
    "discipline to children's lives",
    "uh sometimes children who might not have",
    "that and",
    "uh and i guess finally the thing i wrote",
    "down this morning is the",
    "the age-old expression what sports",
    "teaches you is when you get knocked down",
    "you need to get up and move on",
    "and get back up and get back in the",
    "fight get back in the game",
    "so advantages",
    "in regard to sports there is a great",
    "frustration i know",
    "among parents today about uncertainty",
    "about school but also uncertainty",
    "about sports might be uncertainty about",
    "drama",
    "might be uncertainty about band whatever",
    "your child likes to do and whatever is",
    "an essential part of that child",
    "going to school there still remains",
    "uncertainty",
    "and that is something that is",
    "frustrating to me",
    "i know to the lieutenant governor and i",
    "know it's very very much",
    "frustrating to to particularly to to",
    "parents",
    "look we don't know exactly what is going",
    "to happen",
    "as we move forward we have been working",
    "john has been specifically working with",
    "ohio",
    "high school athletic association working",
    "with coaches",
    "to try to get this thing figured out uh",
    "we have provided",
    "for the continuation of practice and",
    "other things that are normally done the",
    "thing we've not done yet because frankly",
    "we want to get a little bit closer to",
    "the date and see where this situation is",
    "with the covid",
    "we have not provided for the final go as",
    "far as",
    "fall sports particularly in regard to",
    "contact",
    "sports we want to get a little closer",
    "in time to that before making any kind",
    "of",
    "final decisions we also know that some",
    "schools",
    "who are not going back in person going",
    "online have made a decision already",
    "not to go back in regard to to to sports",
    "that is that's their decision um",
    "let me now turn it over uh to the",
    "lieutenant governor to kind of bring you",
    "up to date",
    "uh exactly where we are and to kind of",
    "give you some",
    "indication of where where we're going in",
    "this regard and again i just would say",
    "uh i share your frustration uh",
    "we have to see where this covet is we",
    "have to see what the situation is in",
    "in your community and you have to see",
    "that as well john",
    "thank you governor i appreciate the",
    "opportunity while we're on schools and",
    "sports to to provide a little",
    "clarification about where things stand i",
    "know there's been some confusion out",
    "there about what the rules are",
    "we're going to go back through those",
    "right now",
    "and talk about where things stand first",
    "of all in non-contact sports",
    "non-contact sports have returned",
    "to competition since early june",
    "all sports deemed non-contact can",
    "compete presently",
    "this includes but is not limited to",
    "baseball softball",
    "golf volleyball tennis track and field",
    "swimming",

    "on june the 22nd",
    "we announced a return to practice as",
    "being allowed for",

    "that was put in place allowing the",
    "return for competition for contact",
    "sports okay that was issued",
    "but it was under very very strict",
    "guidelines that included",
    "quarantine period and mandatory testing",
    "and that that order was renewed",
    "last weekend by director health director",
    "lance himes",
    "there has been some confusion about this",
    "in that the renewal of the order somehow",
    "represents the plan for return to play",
    "this fall i want you to know that's not",
    "the case",
    "that's not the case we are still working",
    "with you with the ohio high school",
    "athletic association",
    "to finalize that plan and we are still",
    "considering many options we're trying to",
    "keep the options open because we want",
    "we want student athletes to return to",
    "play",
    "we're trying to accommodate both the",
    "health and the practical considerations",
    "that must go in",
    "to any decision for the athletes coaches",
    "and fans we understand the uncertainty",
    "in the anticipation surrounding the",
    "hopefully forthcoming announcement of",
    "that new guidance here in the near",
    "future",
    "and i can tell you as the governor",
    "alluded there's nobody",
    "in ohio that i think wants to get this",
    "accomplished more than i do",
    "we are working thoughtfully though to",
    "make sure that we get these plans",
    "finalized in the right way",
    "um because i understand from personal",

    "we're trying um very very",
    "we're being very very diligent about",

    "information with our",
    "churches our synagogues our mosque to",

    "the spread of the",
    "virus to at least 91 different people",
    "resulting from just one person with",
    "covet 19",
    "who attended a church service",
    "it spread like wildfire wildfire",
    "very very scary",
    "we know that our faith-based leaders",
    "want nothing more than to protect",
    "those who come to worship we want to",
    "provide our faith communities with all",
    "the information we can from doctors and",
    "health experts",
    "to arm them with the tools to conduct",
    "services safely",
    "our religious faiths are at the core of",
    "our great state",
    "and our great country we thank our",

    "serve god",
    "and god's people we've been very careful",
    "throughout this pandemic to exempt",
    "religious services",
    "from any regulations and the only",
    "exception to that is that we're now",
    "asking",
    "people who who attend church to to wear",
    "a mask",
    "but it's vital that to control the",
    "spread of the virus",

    "we are continuing to have a spread",
    "problem",
    "of the virus because of informal",
    "gatherings among",
    "family and friends we all i guess need",
    "to remember that just because it's your",
    "family",
    "just it's because it's your friends they",
    "could still be carrying the virus",
    "the truth is that it's easier to be",
    "scared of a stranger",
    "than a friend maintaining social",
    "distance",
    "and choosing to not gather for parties",
    "or barbecues",
    "might feel like you're not being",
    "friendly but it really is a sign of",

    "to blame anybody",
    "but i think sometimes they are",
    "illustrative of",
    "situations that we ought to try to avoid",
    "i want to talk about a few of these",
    "today",
    "on my weekly call with our health",
    "commissioners around the state",
    "one of them summed it up well yesterday",
    "just because you're related to someone",
    "doesn't mean you're immune from catching",
    "the virus",
    "from them let me tell you about three",
    "situations that we learned about this",
    "week",
    "in one instance his son lived with his",
    "father who was in",
    "hospice care at home for the two days",
    "before his dad died",

    "two sisters a sister-in-law and great",
    "nephew",
    "all tested positive",
    "um a party with four attendees was held",
    "at the great nephew's house",
    "after that and someone there also became",
    "sick and tested positive",
    "since then two other people including a",
    "child have tested positive in addition",
    "to these people there are also",
    "17 other contacts who are being",
    "monitored",
    "to see if they have the illness",
    "in a different county there was a",
    "wedding the brother of the groom",
    "had symptoms but he attended the wedding",
    "and reception",
    "now today 15 people are sick including",
    "the bride the groom",

    "department is still investigating but",
    "other family members also have gotten",
    "sick",
    "in a third county a bridal shower led to",
    "six confirmed cases",
    "in this situation someone who tested",
    "positive attended the bridal shower",
    "and the virus spread to several others",
    "now there are six households impacted",
    "by this outbreak none of us want to stay",
    "away from our family",
    "none of us want to stay away from our",
    "friends",
    "and it's natural when you go see them to",
    "try to show affection or want to show",
    "affection",
    "but the virus is working uh please try",
    "to remember that you're showing love",
    "by protecting the other person and",
    "protecting them means social distancing",
    "wearing masks around even our family and",
    "closest friends",
    "to keep them safe and prevent the virus",
    "from spreading",
    "over the past week uh we've conducted an",
    "average of about 22 000 tests",
    "a day that certainly is up when from",
    "where we were six weeks ago or so",
    "we've more than doubled it but",
    "we know that we have to continue to",
    "increase that",
    "we need these tests not just to diagnose",
    "individuals but as a screening tool to",
    "help control the spread of the virus",
    "one of the ways to do this is by",
    "expanding the use of rapid point-of-care",
    "tests these tests are faster simpler",
    "and less expensive than the so-called",
    "pcr tests",
    "that we are processing today in our labs",
    "if we could scale up the use of these",
    "rapid point",
    "of care test they could serve as an",
    "important screening tool and a critical",
    "addition to our plan to limit the spread",
    "of cova 19.",
    "so i'm pleased to announce today that we",
    "are entering into a multi-state",
    "purchasing agreement",
    "to expand the use of rapid point-of-care",
    "tests",
    "we have joined maryland louisiana",
    "massachusetts michigan and virginia",
    "to ramp up the use of this type of test",
    "in order to",
    "help detect outbreaks sooner with faster",
    "turnaround times",
    "expand testing in congregate settings",
    "such as nursing homes",
    "assisted living facilities and to make",
    "testing more accessible for the most",
    "high risk and hard hit",
    "communities this interstate purchasing",
    "agreement",
    "with the other states demonstrates we",
    "believe",
    "should demonstrate to testing",
    "manufacturers that there is a",
    "significant",
    "demand for this type of test and has the",
    "potential to help us buy these tests",
    "and associate supplies and are cost",
    "effective and in a sustainable way",
    "as new developments and testing",
    "availability evolve we will continue to",
    "pursue a variety of tools to help us",
    "limit the spread",
    "of coven let me now turn to",

    "well chief thanks to you and the men and",
    "women of your department uh for keeping",
    "us safe",
    "and uh thank you stay safe and thank you",
    "for sharing that",
    "with us we appreciate it very much",
    "lieutenant governor very good",
    "yeah um thanks governor uh",
    "good afternoon again uh as the governor",
    "mentioned earlier it's been a year since",
    "the tragic",
    "oregon district shooting in dayton that",
    "hit us all pretty hard it was very",
    "personal to me in the sense that i used",
    "to work",
    "in that same area for a period of time",
    "in my life",
    "and and we all keep",
    "the victims in our in our",
    "memories but we also want to use their",
    "memory as motivation to get some things",
    "done",
    "and the strong ohio plan which the",
    "governor mentioned",
    "has many components but the innovate",
    "ohio team",
    "the department of public safety and",
    "department of administrative services",
    "have been working on one aspect of it",
    "that the governor mentioned",
    "that i want to dig into a little bit",
    "deeper so you have the background on it",
    "it's a technology solution that's why",
    "the innovate ohio team is involved",
    "and it's something that everyone should",
    "support",
    "the solution is known as e-warrant or",
    "the e-warrant system",
    "let me just briefly explain what problem",
    "the e-warrant system solves",
    "because right now if there's a warrant",
    "or a protection order issued",
    "it's a paper process it's a it's a it's",
    "a slow paper process that requires a",
    "second step",
    "of entering the data into the leads or",
    "the ncic",
    "databases which which these databases",
    "allow",
    "law enforcement to know whether there's",
    "a warrant out",
    "for someone's arrest or a gun store",
    "owner it allows them to know",
    "whether a potential customer can",
    "lawfully purchase a firearm",
    "and since the shooting while we have",
    "seen significant improvements in the",
    "two-step paper process",
    "of compliance we need to modernize the",
    "system there is no doubt about that and",
    "make it free",
    "easy and mandatory this is important",
    "because background checks are",
    "only as effective as the information in",
    "the system",
    "and uh for a long time",
    "it's for a long time i know all my",
    "career second amendment groups have been",
    "calling for this type of reform",
    "uh in the area because it keeps out the",
    "guns out of the hands of",
    "the criminals without infringing upon",
    "the rights of law-abiding citizens",
    "for gun shop owners uh a streamlined",
    "warrant protection order system would",
    "improve their ability",
    "to see all warrants and protection",
    "orders in the background check",
    "in real time and i know this i",
    "frequently talk to gun store owners i",
    "have one gun store",
    "every time this happens he emails me and",
    "says look",
    "we have our 72 hours that we have to",
    "wait before we sell the person a gun",
    "the 72 hours comes and goes they get no",
    "indication about whether or not the",
    "person is lawfully allowed to own a gun",
    "or not",
    "and then weeks months sometimes never",
    "they don't get the they get the",
    "background check verification and it",
    "shows that they should not have sold",
    "that gun to the person because they",
    "weren't legally allowed on it",
    "this system is many holes in it it",
    "doesn't work",
    "and the e and the e warrant system will",
    "help prevent this from happening",
    "it's also about officer safety under the",
    "current system a person could have an",
    "outstanding warrant",
    "and an officer in another jurisdiction",
    "doesn't know that they approach a car or",
    "or",
    "a situation that could be very dangerous",
    "because as they do the background check",
    "they don't know the person they're",
    "confronting actually has a warrant out",
    "for their arrest and an officer",
    "unknowingly goes into that situation",
    "because there are holes in this system",
    "e-warrant will help",
    "fix that innovate ohio as i mentioned",
    "has been working with",
    "the team at public safety in",
    "das to create this free",
    "easy and mandatory system for all of law",
    "for",
    "law enforcement judges and clerks the",
    "award phase of the project is done",
    "and we're beginning the building phase",
    "of this project",
    "our team will begin uh working with the",
    "first counties before the end of the",
    "year",
    "uh and we'll have our initial partners",
    "go live in early 2021 so we're still",
    "about six to seven months from having",
    "this active",
    "and it's worth noting it's worth",
    "emphasizing again",
    "this process this technology we will",
    "take care of the technology side of the",
    "problem but we still need action from",
    "the general assembly",
    "to make it mandatory as the governor",
    "talked about earlier",
    "without that important step in action",
    "from the general assembly we won't have",
    "a requirement that the data",
    "be entered through the e-warrant system",
    "uh and this",
    "this is not a controversial issue uh",
    "e-warrant",
    "has been long supported as i mentioned",
    "by second amendment advocates",
    "and gun owners it's simply an",
    "enforcement tool of existing",
    "law and it needs to happen and we hope",
    "the general assembly will act",
    "before the end of the year and then",
    "finally",
    "a workforce development update workforce",
    "training and development continues to be",
    "a priority for our administration and",

    "application period uh quickly a reminder",
    "on how the program works tech cred helps",
    "ohioans obtain",
    "new skills by reimbursing employers up",
    "to two thousand dollars for a tech",
    "technology focused credential earned by",
    "a current or prospective employee",
    "uh the eligible criteria is it must be a",
    "short-term program so we've got to earn",
    "this in less than a year",
    "it's got to be technology focused and",
    "industry recognized",
    "in the june application period which",
    "which recently closed we saw a 101",
    "percent increase in the credentials",

    "period in january we awarded",
    "1611 credentials well in june",
    "3241 credentials were awarded",
    "this demonstrates the demand out there",
    "and how the technology focused",

    "important",
    "302 companies have been approved today",

    "becoming more and more important in the",
    "workplace",
    "employers are really really",
    "quickly trying to adapt with this by",
    "upgrading the skills of their employees",

    "themselves governor thanks john we're",
    "ready for questions",
    "good afternoon governor marty shladen",
    "ohio capitol journal",
    "at the same time dan mccarthy was",
    "lobbying for first energy he was",
    "president of a dark money group",
    "that funneled millions of dollars into",
    "larry householders dark money group",
    "which federal law enforcement said was",
    "integral to the biggest bribery scandal",
    "in ohio history",
    "knowingly or unknowingly doesn't that",
    "make mccarthy a clear link in this chain",
    "of alleged corruption",
    "and how do you justify keeping him in",
    "his in your administration",
    "and also will he lobby lawmakers to pass",
    "a replacement nuclear bailout",
    "if uh hb6 is repealed",
    "uh he will do what i ask him to do and",
    "what i tell him to do as far as how he",
    "lobbies",
    "that's the way it works",
    "look i i think it's always very",
    "important",
    "um in this great country of ours that we",
    "not",
    "uh you know leap to any kind of",
    "conclusions or guilt by association",
    "uh if you went back to what the u.s",
    "attorney was asked",
    "and i think you all asked him",
    "collectively this twice",
    "you know whether there's any connection",
    "with the governor's office",
    "and the answer the answer was was no",
    "these 501 c 4",
    "independent expenditures are perfectly",
    "legal",
    "uh they're used all the time they're",
    "used by democrats used by republicans",
    "they're used in every state of the union",
    "probably everybody that ran for u.s",
    "senate this year used them everybody ran",
    "for",
    "governor in every state probably used",
    "them",
    "so the mere existence of that",
    "does not mean someone is guilty and",
    "certainly far",
    "far from it doesn't mean they've done",
    "anything wrong so there's no facts that",

    "wrong",

    "administration has done anything wrong",
    "we'll deal with that",

    "uh known him for many years",
    "believe that he is a man of very great",
    "integrity",
    "will you ask him to lobby on a",
    "replacement bill",
    "well i think i might look i i decide the",
    "policy for this administration",
    "and uh you know what we have said",
    "uh is that it this should be repealed",
    "uh and i will have further discussions",
    "with the",
    "senate president um larry abhoff",

    "a number of things and certainly this is",
    "you know i want to get their opinion",
    "about what should happen",
    "after this bill is repealed",
    "hi governor max philby with the columbus",
    "dispatch um",
    "it appears that we're going to be",
    "nearing 100 000 cases in the coming days",
    "so i wanted to ask you to reflect on",
    "that and what it means",
    "and then also we've heard from several",
    "teachers as people prepare to go back to",
    "school this week",
    "several complaining that they feel that",
    "the prisons have gotten more attention",
    "in regards to covid than schools have",
    "and i was hoping you could respond to",
    "that as well",
    "well that's not true look we have an",
    "obligation to protect people who are in",
    "our prisons and do the best we can just",
    "as we have an obligation to pick",
    "uh help our veterans who are at their",
    "two veterans homes just as we have an",
    "obligation to",
    "protect anybody who's in a nursing home",
    "and do everything that we can to help",
    "them",
    "uh you know when this this this started",
    "uh you know we certainly did not have",
    "the testing that we needed to have we",
    "still don't have as much testing as we",
    "would want",
    "so you know we believe that",
    "human life should be protected what we",
    "did today",
    "in regard to requiring that every child",
    "in school",
    "have a mask on is is something that will",
    "directly benefit every teacher",
    "superintendents have heard me say that",
    "you know",
    "and i know that they feel the same way",
    "that they need to worry about their",
    "teachers they need to worry about their",
    "custodians they need to worry about all",
    "the adults who work in the school as",
    "well as worrying about the children",
    "so mask up everybody mask on",
    "is going to make a big big big",
    "difference",
    "any thoughts on the 100 000 cases as we",
    "approach that this week",
    "yeah i'm sorry um yeah it look it's it's",
    "it's it's a mind-boggling number um",
    "you know i think about the deaths i",
    "think about the people who have died by",
    "themselves",
    "um i can't think of anything you know",
    "worse um that's the there's many bad",
    "things about covid but",
    "that's certainly one of them um",
    "the other part that we can't measure uh",
    "frankly",
    "or don't have good data on is in regard",
    "to those people who have suffered",
    "they've lived but they've gone through",
    "hell",
    "for a month or two months or three",
    "months we can't really measure by number",
    "those who have long-term medical",
    "problems those whose organs have been",
    "damaged",
    "yeah this is not anything that any of us",
    "expected",
    "certainly when i ran for governor did",
    "not have any idea that this was this was",
    "coming",
    "but i think about them and i look i i",
    "also think every day about the other",
    "people",
    "uh you know who are out in ohio that we",
    "need to do everything we can to protect",
    "so then the people who have suffered",
    "already",
    "and the people who were trying to",
    "protect none of that ever leaves my mind",
    "never",
    "hello governor karen johnson wlwt in",
    "cincinnati",
    "i'd say the likelihood of students in",
    "kindergarten first grade wearing masks",
    "all day long",
    "is very low so are schools now looking",
    "at either being the mask police",
    "and teachers spending much of their day",
    "forcing kids to keep the mass on",
    "or open themselves up for civil",

    "this is a goal this is what we would",

    "we are limited in the ways that we can",
    "protect people the state of ohio",
    "protect their kids protect the adults",
    "the other way is not to go back to",

    "you know they can do something they can",

    "they can take the mask off during that",
    "period of time whatever you know that's",
    "up",
    "up to that individual teacher but we",

    "this is how you increase the odds of",

    "hi jim oddie from whio tv and dayton the",

    "mask order you are",
    "issuing today for k through 12 students",
    "that's that define the mask does it have",
    "to be a mask",
    "could it be a face shield and then who",
    "sets the specs for this is that your",
    "local",
    "health department or your local board of",

    "their local health department there's",
    "113 health departments they certainly",

    "not trying to micromanage this trying to",

    "and as far as the mask look people can",
    "could go on the internet they can look",
    "it up some masks certainly",
    "are quote better than others but i think",
    "the",
    "majority of the people in the medical",
    "field who i have talked to",
    "have basically said let's just say a",
    "mask let's say a covering that covers",
    "your",
    "covers your your nose covers your mouth",
    "and you know yeah some are better than",
    "others and you can look that up and if",
    "someone wants to get the best they can",
    "do that",
    "but the goal is to have the vast vast",
    "majority of people in a room",
    "who have some facial coverings on",
    "and i think the consensus in the medical",
    "community is let's don't",
    "nitpick let's don't be judgmental uh",
    "put something on and uh you know",
    "i think that's that's what the goal the",
    "goal should be you know it's it's",
    "it's a situation gym where it's at the",
    "cumulative impact",
    "you know it's the cumulative impact of",
    "what we all do",
    "and and you know all of us putting",
    "something on",
    "and look i you know when i talk to the",
    "medical professionals i",
    "call upon my own experience with kids",
    "and what kids can do and what they can't",
    "do and look",
    "if for some reason it doesn't work with",
    "the child it doesn't work with with the",
    "child but the",
    "point is that the vast majority of",
    "people in that room",
    "they can have a mask on it's going to",
    "give them protection is going to protect",
    "protect the other children you know",
    "we we know that schools are facing a",
    "challenge",
    "this is not easy it's not easy to have",
    "the distance",
    "it's not easy on a bus to have the",
    "distance",
    "so these are challenges these are not",
    "easy things at all",
    "so we got to do what we can do and and",
    "and do the things that we can do that we",
    "know will make a difference",
    "and that are actually doable and this is",
    "something that is doable",
    "hey sir christian hauser with local 12",
    "news out of cincinnati",
    "for the past couple of questions you've",
    "actually actually talked about the",
    "importance of mass and how",
    "students k through 12 will be wearing",
    "them well right now there are many that",
    "aren't the athletes that are practicing",
    "aren't required to wear the masks or",
    "follow the social distancing guidelines",
    "while they're practicing right now",
    "so how do you envision being able to",
    "come up with guidelines",
    "for sports when you you said it yourself",
    "that masks and social distancing are the",
    "keys",
    "how do you find a balance between those",
    "and and sports",
    "well it's like everything else in life",
    "you have to try to find a balance you",
    "have to find something that works uh",
    "you know you have to try to figure out",
    "what your goals are what you're trying",
    "to achieve and then how you can",
    "best achieve them so there's no magic",
    "formula work you know",
    "to to how this to how this gets done but",
    "i think having the norm and having what",
    "the goals are",
    "uh you know look there are some",
    "certainly sometimes",
    "athletes would certainly be able to have",
    "a mask on that may depend on the sport",
    "but certainly there's opportunities for",
    "that certainly when",
    "athlete is going on a bus to to cross",
    "country meet or whatever it is certainly",
    "the athlete could have",
    "could have a mask on these are things",
    "that have to be worked out",
    "we we don't have our our final orders in",
    "regard to",
    "sports yet and but that certainly are",
    "things that we",
    "will take into consideration but it's",
    "look it's it's all a balance it's all",
    "trying to figure out",
    "what you practically can do and still",
    "achieve whatever the goal",
    "the goal is i mean let's let's take a",
    "teacher in a classroom",
    "if there's some reason you know that",
    "that that teacher because the age of the",
    "kids or other things",
    "you know cannot wear a mask maybe there",
    "isn't maybe a face shield",
    "will work part of the time and this",
    "people can adjust to this",
    "but i think if they know mask is the",
    "norm",
    "mask is the best face shield is is a",
    "maybe a backup",
    "people will figure out how to do these",
    "things and uh",
    "you know they will by not wearing masks",
    "that's the first part is that risking",
    "these athletes safety by",
    "not forcing them to wear masks",
    "put out a final we've not put out a",
    "final order on that i know john you",
    "won't say anything on that or not but",
    "clearly when you're in the midst of",
    "competition you can't wear a mask that's",
    "what makes",
    "competitive contact sports difficult",
    "right now when participants are not on",
    "the field",
    "they're supposed to socially distance",
    "they're supposed to",
    "follow all those protocols that's what",
    "the hashtag i want a season is all about",
    "it's about helping young people",
    "understand that if they want to",
    "participate",
    "if they want their teammates to",
    "participate if they want to have a",
    "season",
    "they have to own these responsibilities",
    "to make sure that they're protecting",
    "themselves the coaches have to re",
    "to enforce these things so that they can",
    "have a season this has been",
    "effectively working by and large in",
    "non-contact settings",
    "but we know that contact settings are",
    "more difficult",
    "that's why it has been a challenge to",
    "come up with",
    "the proper protocols to do these things",
    "but we are working daily",
    "with coaches with the athletic",
    "association",
    "to make sure that we can provide a safe",
    "environment for those student athletes",
    "and and coaches as possible",
    "good afternoon this is jackie borchardt",
    "from the cincinnati enquirer governor",
    "earlier you mentioned certainty in",
    "relation to schools",
    "several schools are starting in the next",
    "couple weeks you haven't ruled out a",
    "state order closing schools",
    "at what point or by what metric would",
    "you take that action",
    "well we're not contemplating doing that",
    "i mean look",
    "the pathway to go to school this year",
    "and to make it",
    "um and to be",
    "back in school um it's not gonna be easy",
    "uh the covet is here we know that uh but",
    "the best shot that we have at doing that",
    "is if if we do two things",
    "one is we control the environment in the",
    "school the best we can",
    "and what we announced today while maybe",
    "controversial",
    "uh is based on medical science and that",
    "is that if the kids can all wear a mask",
    "teachers all wear a mask custodians",
    "everybody wears a mask",
    "we're going to be a lot safer in that in",
    "that building",
    "so we know that the other thing that we",
    "can control",
    "um without a vaccine you just you're",
    "limited to what you control",
    "the other thing we can control is",
    "community spread",
    "collectively we can control that this",
    "virus cannot go from one person to the",
    "other unless we help it get there",
    "and so the wearing a mask and the",
    "distancing is vitally important",
    "i made a big point uh last week and when",
    "when we put up the map statewide map uh",
    "looking at the number of yellow yellow",
    "counties and then we looked at how many",
    "of those yellow counties had turned",
    "orange",
    "and what i said was look you know if we",
    "want to control this community spread we",
    "can do it in these small counties",
    "but we've got to get on it and we've got",
    "to have more people we've got to have",
    "more people wearing masks",
    "so my message today you know if you're",
    "in a smaller county",
    "and what we've seen is in our urban",
    "areas and",
    "and most of our suburbs we've seen the",
    "number of people the percentage of",
    "people wearing masks out in public has",
    "gone up dramatically",
    "we have not seen that as much in our",
    "rural areas and so",
    "if we want to get kids back to school in",
    "the rural areas if we want to have",
    "sports",
    "again it's what we do in regard to",
    "retarding",
    "community spread and the way you do that",
    "is by distance and by masking",
    "so these are the two variables that we",
    "are that we are playing with",
    "two variables that we can impact uh and",
    "it's it's up to all of us uh what we do",
    "every day",
    "um you know what the odds are that we're",
    "going to be able to you know have kids",
    "in school",
    "as of today you do not have plans to",
    "that look we've learned what works",
    "we know that masks work",
    "and what you're going to see from",
    "schools",
    "is that they're going to be doing some",
    "are going to be doing five days a week",
    "some are going to be doing a hybrid",
    "model some are going to be doing",
    "distance learning",
    "and none of us know what to expect from",
    "any of those situations because we've",
    "never been through it before with covid",
    "we will all learn from what's going to",
    "happen in the coming weeks",
    "and and schools and families and leaders",
    "will be able to adjust",
    "uh to what we see happening on the",
    "ground",
    "and and at we know as we learn as we get",
    "more information",
    "we make decisions that that uh address",
    "those",
    "uh the situation that we confront i just",
    "also say jackie that",
    "you know what goes on in individual",
    "school the people who are in that school",
    "are going to know it first",
    "and frankly they're going to make the",
    "first decisions",
    "you know we hope we have no incidents",
    "but we know with the covet virus out",
    "there there will be",
    "um there will be some spread there will",
    "be some in school and we just know that",
    "and so those i think it's so very very",
    "important",
    "for those schools to have a plan now a",
    "plan now",
    "about what they do and i know i'm",
    "talking from superintendents they're all",
    "working on that or already have a plan",
    "they're focused along with the local",
    "health people the local health",
    "department",
    "what do we do if we have a problem how",
    "do we isolate what do we do",
    "and so they all are look looking at that",
    "but you could envision a situation",
    "where you got a problem with because of",
    "sports you got a problem because of",
    "who knows what and schools will make a",
    "decision",
    "and they'll make it long long before",
    "we'll make those decisions probably",
    "because they're on the scene",
    "and they're the ones who are directly",
    "accountable and are seeing what's",
    "happening to their kids and to their",
    "the adults in that school system that's",
    "where you're going to see it first",
    "adrian robbins nbc4 uh governor dewine",
    "dr fauci said the u.s needs to get a",
    "hold on the virus and get down to 10",
    "000 new cases a day by september do you",
    "think it's realistic to think that here",
    "in ohio we could be down to somewhere",
    "around 200",
    "new cases when right now we're seeing",
    "well over a thousand",
    "in just months with the current orders",
    "we have in place and",

    "timeline we're on",
    "well thank you for the question uh look",
    "there has to be a sense of urgency",
    "what we found with the virus is you",
    "don't turn it on or turn it off",
    "overnight",
    "and you know the steps that we are",

    "things that we can do",
    "but in spending the weekend talking to",
    "experts from throughout the country",
    "you know the majority of people",
    "that we talked to while being very",
    "honest and saying we can't predict where",
    "this virus is going",
    "but most experts when you talk to them",
    "are concerned about what happens exactly",
    "what you said",
    "when winter comes what happens in winter",
    "at the flu season",
    "in addition to the flu season you know",
    "you have",
    "you have the coven you have people",
    "moving back inside",
    "one of the things john talked about how",
    "much we've learned in the last four or",
    "five months",
    "one thing we've learned is how very very",
    "very much",
    "danger more dangerous it is for for",

    "and particularly if they're in a crowded",
    "room the more people in the room",
    "and that's the recirculation of that air",
    "so that is a very dangerous thing it's",
    "one of the",
    "reasons candidly that you know",
    "schools should really really really look",
    "hard",
    "at getting their kids outside as much as",
    "humanly possible",
    "you know we've got tough ohio winters",
    "but our september's and our",

    "so thinking about how to have class",
    "outside",
    "thinking about how to do other things",
    "outside for the kids it is so much safer",
    "there's a study that was just",
    "completed uh indicated it was 19 times",
    "more dangerous to be inside",
    "uh than outside uh and so that's a",
    "that's a that's a part of reality that",
    "we can we can have it have an impact but",
    "uh",
    "look we've got to get these numbers down",

    "seeing some of our early indicators go",
    "down the other side of that is we're",
    "seeing spread out into our rural areas",
    "we're seeing spread virtually throughout",
