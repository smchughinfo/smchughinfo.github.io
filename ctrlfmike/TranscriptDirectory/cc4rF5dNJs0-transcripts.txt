this morning in case number 2020-0638
hassan mohammed
petitioner versus william eckleberry
seneca county sheriff respondent
we are here for an evidentiary hearing
on petitioner's request for rid of
habeas corpus
and for the record i'll note that this
hearing is being conducted remotely
and that it is open to the public as it
is being streamed
live online through a link on the
court's website
council would you please introduce
yourselves for the record
eric allen on behalf of petitioner
hassan mohamed
derek devine on behalf of respondent
william f ecklebury seneca county
sheriff
thank you now it is my understanding
that we have two witnesses who may be
providing live
testimony this morning um before we
begin i want to give a brief instruction
to the witnesses um before uh before we
proceed
um so gentlemen in a moment you will be
removed from the main
hearing into a virtual ra waiting room
where you will be not be able to see or
hear what's going on the in
in this hearing while you're in those
waiting rooms
um i'm instructing you now not to watch
the hearing while it is being streamed
live online
and i'm also instructing you not to
communicate with each other
in any way while the hearing is going on
or to listen to
each other's testimony before you
yourself have testified
um do either of you have any questions
about that
no sir all right thank you
michael you can now move the witnesses
to the waiting room
thanks michael um so before we hear for
from witnesses um i'll give about
council an opportunity to make a brief
opening statement if you would like um
mr allen
uh yes your honor um in looking at this
case and filing the
the state habeas petition i would
uh mention a number of things that we
hope to prove here this morning
uh first the bond was set
uh in this case without counsel present
uh has remained at a million dollars
for the time that mr hassan has been
incarcerated
both of his brothers will testify to his
lack of a criminal record of any kind
his character
um where he was in 2018
as the respondent has brought up uh the
facts of the case
which normally aren't brought up in a
bond hearing but this is sort of a
not a bond hearing but something
different so
um we believe that once you hear all the
evidence that
you'll find that the bond is
unreasonable and and reset it
accordingly thank you
mr devine would you like to make an
opening statement at this time
yes your honor thank you um a couple of
things
uh first i think it's important that the
this um this hearing be undertaken
um uh as a review for an abuse of
discretion by the trial court
um the the
the this proceeding should look at
the the factors of under criminal 46 for
this for the establishment of bond
as we've indicated in our
in our filings certified copies
the petitioner has been indicted on four
felony counts
uh two uh f1s and two
f twos with gun specifications
um and we believe that that the nature
of those charges
is uh should should be a significant
factor
for a trial court and establishing bond
and in this court's review of that bond
i would also indicate that in the
filings that we've
we've made there there's certified
copies from a
a moiler case mr moyler was
i indicted for aiding and abetting
the petitioner in this case moiler
is the person who identifies petitioner
as the individual who got out of the car
and fired the handgun
moiler has pled guilty to two felony
counts
as it relates to his indictment as the
aider and a better of petitioner
as it relates to these proceedings
we've been we've included a copy
certified copy of mr
moyler's judgment entry for his bond
hearing
and as the person who was accused of
aiding in a betting
petitioner his bond was set at the exact
same amount
as petitioners we would also
um think that the evidence is going to
establish
that there's been no motion filed in the
trial court
where the evidence being presented to
this court
has ever been presented and we would
think that
that proceeding
and and granting any type of relief
without first giving the trial court
that same opportunity
would establish a precedent that
um that would not be appropriate
thank you thank you
yeah and with that mr allen you may call
your first witness
oh uh ali muhammad
[Music]
mr muhammad i'm going to need you to
display a photo id before i can
administer the oath
within just a moment thank you
and if you would raise your right hand
please do you solemnly swear or affirm
the testimony you give will be the truth
the whole truth and nothing but the
truth
yes ma'am thank you

okay kenneth
um did you know or knew a hassan
muhammad
yes i knew he saw muhammad he was a cool
kid
and you know he helped me out in the
situation for my job
okay um
so i'm gonna ask you a series of
questions okay
okay um just be honest with me it's not
something that
um i understand that uh
you didn't know muhammad and uh the next
following questions i just need you to
be as honest as possible of course
okay good um are you aware that he was
arrested
yes i was aware his brother had called
me like immediately after it happened
okay
so do you know why he was arrested
i'm not specifically sure but i think
the way his brother was telling me
he was identified in a situation that
matched his identity
but was i like i guess with some other
guy
but i don't believe that happened
because the song was with me the whole
spring
of 2018 and he was not in the highest
because i had work and he was taking me
back and forth to work that was not
right
okay so you knew
now now you and i both know 2018 is kind
of far away right
yeah that's okay like a little over a
year ago
i want to say well then at the time you
know before he was
arrested i knew him like a year and some
change
okay okay um and you
you could remember these dates how
because i met her sawing in january
of um
2018 at uh savoy
this restaurant in the strip district uh
they had a new year's eve party so i met
him in 2018
of january and that's how long i knew
him for a year in this
game until he was you know so like okay
so when was the last time
you saw her the last time i saw the song
was
the ending week
of march of 2019 just a few months ago
actually well i'm sorry not two minutes
ago but 2019
a few months after the new years of 2019
i've seen them like the end of
the ending week of march yeah
yeah and i tried calling him but his
phone kept going to voicemail
i've been calling him like a whole month
after you know that and his phone was
one of voicemail
and then that's when his brother ali
caught me you know and i almost got
fired from my job because i know right
to work
so i was really pressuring him to you
know debate depending on him
and relying on him to come back and
forth to work okay
so so okay let's let's go back so you
you can remember these dates because he
was
derived to work correct yes okay so
let me ask you on march 27 2018
did you see hassan yes i did see us on
march 27th
of 2018. he used to he picked me up in
fourth
he picked me up back and forth from my
home to work
so um i can pick up my clients and we
had an arrangement with each other
so yes i seen him and so do you
so so so you were scheduled to work on
march 27 2018
yes which i believe is the weakness my
client's name is charles and troll
i got him for six hours a day and it was
from two day
2 pm to 8 pm so that was a tuesday
because i got him on tuesdays
wednesdays thursdays and fridays so yes
and i had a song
taking me to pick him up okay so so so
is march 23rd a weekday or a weekend
march 23rd is actually a weekday but i
have my client on the 27th sorry that's
not march 23rd
27th yes but i mean that's still a
weekday but i had my client on the 27th
which was also a weekday
which was a tuesday i want to say
because i had anyone uh that beginning
of the week
yes okay so what were you wearing
when you were sorry
i was wearing a gray sweatshirt and a
great sweatshirt
both great sweatpants i don't think they
have nothing to do with
the incident about hassan okay gotcha
um is it true like as a home health aide
you have to have training yeah some sort
of bad
okay um and
did he tell you what he did or worked as
or yeah when i met her son
we had an agreement to take michael to
work take me back and forth to work
because uber's list was more expensive
so
he knocked a few dollars off for me
which was appreciative so
back and forth trips you know him taking
him back and forth to work we discussed
him
um taking his i want to say a nursing
exam
or to be his clinician's exam to become
a nurse
and um whenever he moved here from ohio
so that's what he's putting his focus on
his nursing license like he worked for
uh
upmc here oh okay and that's something
that helped him with
you know now did he work for upmc at the
time or he was you're saying he's just
studying like he's getting his license
or no he was just studying
for his nursing exam and he just moved
from a higher he didn't work there again
but
his his working abilities was driving
driving me
back and forth to work and hustling you
know trying to make a living
on his living an innocent living because
he was very delicate he was a good guy
very friendly guy okay now okay so so
did did he tell you uh if he
oh like like he said you said that you
know that he's from ohio yeah he said it
was from a husband since i met him i
knew him
no he didn't go try because he was
offered
he was offered if he passed his nursing
license exam he was offered 10k
bonus on the spot you know if he started
working with upmc
so that's what his main focus was was
his license so that's what he was doing
other than that no he didn't go back and
forth to ohio because i had work
and he would take me back and forth to
work okay
uh okay so
okay give me a second here
okay because i'm a little parched myself
yeah sorry you need some water we'll get
you we're almost done here okay
um so how how often did he say he
he he um he visits ohio
he didn't really say as long as i knew
him he didn't ever go back
so i so between new years when he moved
there you said he moved there new year's
or i met him new year okay so
between new year's and when he was
arrested
did you ever had a conversation with him
saying hey i'm going to ohio this
weekend
no he didn't like he didn't want to go
back to life because he was studying for
his nursing exam
and besides me and him was real cool
after that so we kind of vaped off each
other made a connection
and he was not right back and forth to
work so we kind of connected
and we just stayed around each other it
was very friendly vibes okay
so so what's hassan's height i'm 16.
so i know he probably came out like to
my shoulders
i'm see about my shoulders so probably a
little under
six foot i want to say he's not he's
tall but
i'm tall and i'm big i'm like a giant
son everybody's shorter than me
and like did you know his facial
complexioner
he looked like me same question
like honey all right so um
did you ever see hassan with a gun or
engaged in any
criminal activities no because i'm not a
criminal
i don't engage engaging activities
that's not my lifestyle a song whenever
we hung with each other
it was nothing but laughs you know great
times out to eat you know he just smoked
hookah and played basketball in his free
time
and that's that's that i don't know his
before like when he moved here
to pittsburgh but i know he was here he
was a good dude great dude he was very
fun
um you know we just had our own little
connection
so he never said anything about hey um
anything about like guns or you never
notice anything in his car
like did you no no he's a pretty clean
guy he was kind of like you kind of
remind me of like
and i believe he came from like a
suburban background because me myself i
don't hang around
nothing out of the ordinary so okay so
so what
what color card did did he drive i was
here
he drove a white impala like an older
white impala
okay have you ever seen him with
a gold toyota no it was
it was only one standard coral which was
his white chevy impala
okay are you sure yes okay
i'm very sure i'm very 100 positive did
he have a girlfriend in virginia
i don't know nothing about girlfriends
but i never hear
in the city he was a ladies man he had a
lot of ladies around him
but that's not something i want to talk
about that's personal okay okay
i don't want to bring that one um do you
know what side of town he lived in
he lived on the north side he lived on
the north side right by agh allegheny
general hospital to be exact
that's where we live okay and um
kind of like to get a yeah how long did
he live there
since i've known him a year okay
and and did you
did you did he ever did you ever see him
like smoke
marijuana or anything like that or no
like i said all you did was just smoke
hookah
and play basketball so so okay kind of
like an athlete
okay so let me explain to you what's
going on here again hassana
is currently being accused of committing
a crime
attempted murder wow
now my question to you is what city did
he say he's from like
did he move from north ohio
central or um
i don't really know i'm from pittsburgh
everyone knew ohio
but i know he just said columbus ohio
that's all i know
okay so have you ever heard him talk
about
toledo
have you ever heard him talk about ohio
i've never heard him say that against
her
tipping i never heard of tiff in ohio
and he never explained
nothing to ohio and i'm not the type of
guy to get in someone's personal
business i let people event when they
want to vent
you know not ask questions of course i
want to get to know you as a person but
i bought a criminal past or anything he
never stated anything like that but like
i said as far as i knew him
right we had our kind of like bromance
our own you know
relationship a civilized relationship so
that's something i can go based off of
but i know for a fact
this guy didn't do no murdering no
killings like he didn't come out to me
like that because i don't play that i'm
a certified
you know nursing assistant so i don't
want that around me and i have a child
that i got full custody of so i can't
afford anything like that for it to
happen
so okay as far as him being a criminal
no sir
okay so so
so you don't see him ever committing
such
a crime like attempted murder no okay do
you see him committing any type of fraud
no anybody can commit fraud but like
again like i said if he was the type of
person committed fraud
he wouldn't have made no range no
arrangements for me to even
you know scramble that change driving
him driving back and forth to work so
no he's not a friend trust me i know
people that are frogs but he's not one
he don't come off as that type of guy
like see i got the wrong person i really
want to tell y'all
i'm a thousand percent sure that you
guys have the wrong
guy i was with him on the day y'all
talking about him
committing a crime or incident that
happened he was not there
okay so
uh march um
you said that that date
you have to go into work yeah and your
shift ends at 6 pm
nothing's at 8. it is 3 p.m to 8 p.m
yes my client has six hours
so
is there any way you could see him on
that date
going to back to ohio and then coming
pick you back
up not exactly i don't think so because
whenever
we whenever he dropped me off at work he
had came from playing basketball
and then he was talking for a little bit
and we both was tired because
i was working and he was just like well
i'm just going to go to sleep and then
just call me ahead of time so i could be
on time to pick you up
so you don't have no words so at 2 p.m
he
he dropped you off and he dropped you
off
at your client's house that you take
care of yes so then
you're assuming that he came back home
and went to sleep and took a nap
no i'm not assuming no this is what i
said
what i said was he i had to be working
at two o'clock so he played basketball
practice or basketball early in the
morning you know
early afternoon late afternoon
and he came to pick me up about a
quarter after one
130 he picked me up and we went to my
client's house at two
so again i said when we got in the car
we was talking we both
we both exaggerated we were tired so
whenever he dropped me off he said he
was gonna go home and go back to sleep
but he told me to call him ahead of time
so i
he's gonna be late picking me up got it
so what
was he paying what were you paying him
to to have him drive you
like fifty dollars sometimes i would
just a little bit extra money
but he was kind of like a friend so i'm
gonna look out for him and i wanted to
try to help him you know pursue his
career that he went in
right right so i want to show some of
those podcasts okay so fifty dollars
uh like fifty dollars a week or
a week yeah like fifty dollars a week
here
okay sometimes i would add it more right
so
okay let me ask you this on that date
now do you ever foresee that maybe he
was driving some different car
sir no like did he have another car that
you know
okay no whenever i met him you know he
picked me up from work and even if
when i went on a few times i met up with
him you know we all be
you know having fun drinking a little
bit and then even walking outside you
know when the
when the bars closed or the hookah cafes
closes he walked to his car which was a
white chevy impala
make sure you get their save and we will
be with a couple of friends around this
and that was that
i never see him in any other car and
even
you know the gassy hungry or even when
he was with me no one had a gold
car i don't know okay did hus
did hassan carry a wallet
or have you ever seen him like if you
don't have if you have to go to a
drive-through
yeah and a person takes out his wallet
um now did he have several credit cards
or
how does i pay him cash if i mean if
everything
but if you if you try to remember if you
try to um i guess going like a dunkin
donuts or something
yeah would he have several credit cards
in his wallet or was it was cash or what
was
it would be cash i'd pay cash so i
believe
but you've never seen him with like 10
different credit cards did you
did you ever see him with more than one
credit card in there did he ever like
you know
not that i know of i don't think i've
ever seen with a credit card
like not 10 different credit cards but
no just cash
okay okay uh
all right that's pretty much and i don't
i want to say
one thing for the record i don't know
the situation like i don't know the full
situation
or the full explanation from what's
going on with him
but i know that hassan was not there on
the date that y'all said he was there
which was what march 27th
that it happened i know someone's
because he was with me emperor says he's
not that guy i don't know if
if it's a race thing you know that still
exists or whatever in this society but i
know that
hassan mohammed was not there he was
with me taking me to work to look at my
clan
charles scott between 2 and 8 p.m and he
dropped me off i couldn't because
i'm not the type i don't want to i don't
like being picked up late or i don't
want to be late to anything
so i know for a fact he didn't do it and
i believe that in my heart a thousand
and he didn't do that that man is
innocent
all right other questions no that's
that's pretty much it thanks kenneth
okay i appreciate it
all right uh please state your name for

employment that is correct sir

and on that it shows that on the 27th he
worked from
2 to 8 p.m
okay all right
do you know if hassan can afford a
million dollar bond
um i don't know
how about your family i believe my
family
wouldn't be able to do this as well
how much money can your family raise to
pay bond for mr
mohammed for a song um five five
thousand
okay
and would you be able to
ensure he would appear at every court
appearance yes sir
he believed that he would show up to
every court appearance
yes he would okay
uh would he abide by any conditions of
the bond
he would abide by all the conditions
do you have any concerns that he would
uh take off
and leave your family owing the bond no
no no no
no at all
and is your family willing to uh
put up this money knowing that they'll
have to appear for trial
yes okay

calm person timid he's very friendly
and also a very determined person hard
working
in terms of school and things of that
nature okay
is he a violent person no he
uh i mean throughout my life the last
time
i i've seen hassan ever fight was
probably
elementary school um throughout his life
he was never a person who liked to fight
more to sort of reason try to solve
things through
verbally dizzy on a gun or a rifle
no never touched one and he
he was in nursing school did you uh
collect some records from the nursing
school
do i have some what was that yeah do you
do you remember collecting some record
did hassan go to
school for nursing do you remember
collect
some records for that
um yeah i don't have it uh with me at
the moment but uh
well i'm gonna i'm gonna show them to
you here i
i don't have it with me at the moment
but he um he graduated from nursing
school
in the beginning of january
okay he
there we go okay uh
can you see that
okay
can you see that
try this again
how about this can you see that
um one it's a bit
blurry there let me see
yeah that's his transcript okay that
appear to be the
mature and accurate copy of what you
received
yeah that's the one i sent you okay a
while back
yeah he went to the american institute
of alternative medicine that's
and did he graduate did he graduate from
there
as far as you know yeah he graduated
from there he uh he was actually
preparing uh studying for quite some
time for the uh
nursing certification nclex exam
okay and he began studying that
uh right after he graduated and
ultimately what was hassan trying to
become in his life what was he trying to
do for employment uh
ultimately what he was trying to achieve
is to become a nurse
he wanted to take some time off a bit
you know it's a debrief because
you know nursing school can be a bit
difficult but he uh
ultimately wanted to become a director
of nursing for his brother's home health
care
our brother okay
and in terms of hassan being a threat to
anyone do you have any concerns about
him being a threat
no no and
your brother's been locked up for
roughly 18 months
do you have any uh concerns about his
health
uh could you repeat that part sorry the
video is kind of audio's kind of lagging
that's all right do you have any
concerns about hassan's health
since he's been incarcerated
uh in in in the jail at the moment
yes
uh yeah i mean his concern uh when he
was younger
uh he always had his little heart
problems
um i i'm not sure if it was
he got infections or younger when he was
younger but he always had heart problems
he would have heart palpitations and
whatnot
um my dad has murmurs
i believe he also has that as well
um one another thing he also has
anxieties
uh he he has anxiety he
one of the things i remember in school
was whenever there was a test or
upcoming exam
you would usually need to like probably
take it
alone or you know a different time
period because of the
anxiety during the test was so much for
him um
you know being jailed for that long i'm
pretty sure that
all those problems have you know gotten
worse
considering he's never been seen by
actual
doctor or whatnot okay
uh other than what you've mentioned are
there any mental health issues that
you're concerned about i mean in jail i
mean he's con he's been in there for
almost what i don't know 13 years
actually 13 months i can't remember
uh he meant i mean the anxiety is
worse um he you know when i talk to him
he's not the same individual as he was
before
um he has insomnia he doesn't really
sleep much
um overall he's just very
disease i'd say he's
i don't know he's not the same person he
was once before
yeah okay
did he ever mention a john moiler to you
okay repeat that sorry the video is
lagging again
did you ever mention a john moiler to
you
um can you hear me now don't know
what to do but let me interject here for
a minute uh and let's go off the record
um michael do you have any uh
anything you can assist with here
uh no greg he uh it's strictly due to
his internet connection so if it
hasn't uh cleared up uh the best
course is for him to to dial in
okay mr allen are you near the end
with him how much longer are we not much
longer
um mr mohammed can you hear hear us
right now um yeah
i can't even i can't really hear much
why don't we michael let's do the dial
in
um to wrap this up
okay sounds good
[Applause]
[Music]
are we still off the road
[Music]
mr
[Music]
we have you back in the hearing room
we're off the record at this point
um and mr allen is going to uh conclude
his examination so let's go back on the
record
uh so we're back on the record uh mr
mohamed had some
uh technical connection issues and
um does have been addressed hopefully we
were able to finish
his examination mr muhammad i will
remind you that you
are still under oath uh mr allen i'll
turn it back to you
thank you um mr mohammed did a son ever
mention a john moiler
uh never and me yeah never i never
heard of a john muller about tiffin ohio
going
yeah never heard of tiffin before this
case okay
if if uh hassan was released where would
he live
uh he'd live in columbus uh
my father went in a car crash back in
october of 13th so he um
of 2018 so he actually wants to spend
more time with
his father and is that
would that be equipped for electronic
monitoring or gps if the court were
to impose that yes okay
[Music]
and
what do you know if uh he would have any
work
if he was released is there any
discussion about him
having employment or anything like that
um
i have he would if he were to come out i
mean his primary
focus would probably be to continue his
study
i'm trying for that uh nursing
certification exam the net in class exam
yeah so he has a lot of books here and
you want it actually yeah
okay can you your family or or
hassan afford a million dollar bond
no what what would be a a reasonable
bond that you could afford
um i mean we would prefer him coming out
you know with
no no amount to pay since we believe
he's innocent but uh
if we're pushing it i'd say maybe 5 000
okay that's that's if
uh it were 10 percent or 10
yeah okay and do you have any
uh concerns that hassan would abide by
the conditions of the court
yeah he would he would abide by every
rule set upon him
okay do you have any concerns that he
would be a threat to anyone no
um you were present in
december at the motion to suppress
hearing yes
do you remember me asking the judge to
reduce the bond
yes i do remember okay do you remember
what his answer was
yes he denied it and kept it as a
million okay
i have no further questions mr devine
good morning mr mohammed good morning
um have you ever testified uh
or offered evidence in any manner in the
seneca county common police court
regarding the release of your brother
uh no i have no further questions your
honor thank you
mr allen anything um no your honor uh
this witness may be excused thank you mr
mohammed for your time this morning
all right thank you
mr allen any additional evidence this
morning to present
your honor i would just ask that the uh
the three exhibits that we
um discussed via the live testimony be
admitted
the other um
exhibit that we had proffered uh
is is for um
[Music]
we just ask you to consider that as well
that's just that's something that i just
got so it would be difficult to get a
witness to testify to that so we'd ask
that you consider that as well
and for the record can you just briefly
explain what that other
exhibit is that you're referring to i i
can
probably be good for the record to
explain what each one is
exhibit one is the video of mr turner
exhibit two is mr turner's employment
records
exhibit three is a page and i can
introduce the entire
report if you wish from a police report
where by the
one of the victims picked out the
original hussein muhammad that the
tiffin police department picked up and
exhibit four
is mr muhammad's transcript from nursing
school
okay thank you um
with that anything else from the
petitioner this morning
um other than argument now yeah we'll do
argument at the end
mr devine um any any uh
evidence to present this morning we
would rest on the evidence we've
previously
uh submitted via sworn affidavit from
detective chandler and the certified
copies
from the seneca county common police
court
okay thank you um and obviously it's
already
has been alluded to just now both
parties did file
written evidence and some other
information last week
with the clerk's office under criminal
rule 46
f that information and the evidence in
addition to what was presented this
morning
does not need to conform to the rules of
evidence therefore the information
presented
this morning and the documents
previously filed with the clerk are
submitted for the court's consideration
um and with that we'll conclude with
closing arguments uh mr allen
yeah sharon thank you i um i i think
first we have to to start uh mr muhammad
was brought back
from um pittsburgh uh a bond hearing
was held in front of a magistrate
without counsel
the bond was set at a million dollars
um it should be noted in this case that
uh while there was a shooting no one was
hit
or injured in this matter doesn't
obviously excuse what occurred but
there was no uh physical injury to
anyone
um i did request the court to reduce the
bond
at the conclusion of emotions to
suppress hearing the second mr mohammed
testified
to that the judge refused to allow
uh reduction in the bond um and
that motionless press was sitting for
about four months
what is finally ruled upon we were in
the middle of the pandemic
mr muhammad has no prior criminal record
mr muhammad has no history of violence
mr muhammad would certainly abide by any
conditions
of the court if they were good to
release him on bond
i believe that both mr mohammed's
testified they could probably afford a
fifty thousand dollar bond
i think that's more in line with a
reasonable bond
given the fact that here no persons were
injured
given that um there is some question
as to the identity of mr mohammed
the first person they picked up was
picked out by the victim as this is the
person so
you know you have to wonder you know
whether or not they're going to be able
to get a
conviction in this case mr moyler we
have always argued that mr moyler was
pressured into making this
identification of mr muhammad
so with looking at all those things and
all those things that we presented both
here
in live testimony and via paper
testimony and the video that
was played for the court we would ask
that you uh
reduce the bond and release mr mohammed
from the seneca county jail
thank you and one one question for you
mr allen
you're asking for a reduction of the
bond and is there a specific amount that
you're asking the court to reduce it to
i i would ask the court to reduce fifty
thousand dollars with a ten percent
provision
um that's in line with uh his
lack of a criminal history uh his
ties to the community in columbus
columbus is roughly an hour and a half
from
from tiffin which is where he'd be
living um
and i think that's that's far more
reasonable than
and that certainly would uh make sure
that he would
come to court and abide by any
conditions if his family had to put up
that amount of money
okay thank you mr devine
thank you your honor um
mr allen had hit on criminal rule 46
um and and we would agree that we're not
aware of any prior convictions
um we would we would strongly disagree
though
as it relates to the the nature of the
offense
the fact that nobody was hit with the
bullet and injured
uh does not negate in any way the
alleged criminal conduct
uh in this case uh the defendant is
indicted on two counts of attempted
murder
um and then two counts of felony assault
for uh the firing of a handgun
into an automobile uh in in the
city of tiffin uh when you look at 46
c1 you look at the nature and
circumstances of the crime charged
and whether the defendant used right
access to a weapon
we have somebody who is indicted
for a felony of the first degree which
faces
a significant period of incarceration
gun specification would be a mandatory
additional time
so the defendant is looking at
significant
incarceration if he is convicted
as it relates to um the identification
of of the uh of the petitioner
um we we agree there was an uh
somebody named hassan i'm sorry hussain
muhammad who was initially identified
by the victim of the crime
as as being the shooter the person who
the state is relying on to identify the
shooter
is a person who was driving the car
to the crime scene who saw with
a person who had been part of a scam
to defraud a financial institution
the girlfriend of moyler
gave a statement to tiffany police that
she went to high school
with petitioner and she's the one who
actually came forward
when hussein muhammad's picture was in
the paper
and said you got the wrong guy so our
identification at trial is going to be
based on
the girlfriend of moyler who went to
high school with
petitioner and mr moyler moyler was
indicted
on complicity 2 charges
and he pled guilty to a complicity to
felonious assault
and an inferior degree offense of
complicity to aggravated assault
and he was sentenced to a term of
incarceration for his role
in these crimes while
i i i don't have any
way to explain
why tiffany police department would be
pressuring
mueller to identify
hassan muhammad as the shooter
instead of hussein muhammad as the
shooter
both the misidentified hussein
and the uh since identified hassan
are not people who the different police
department has previously dealt with
they're not on the radar of local law
enforcement it's not like this person
is a is a known um you know
you know bad guy who the police uh have
you know has focused on these are both
um both muhammad's are are were known to
be
residents of franklin county and had no
involvement
prior to this with seneca accounting so
that there's there's no
there's no logical basis for tiffany
police department
pressuring moiler who admitted his role
in the crimes
readily to have him misidentify
a petitioner as the person who committed
the crime
i think it's important for this this
court to consider
um the the precedent that that
petitioner is is asking um he's
presented
evidence and testimony here today that
has never been presented
to the trial court judge he's asking
the trial court uh judge's determination
on bond
to be changed or modified based on
evidence
uh arguments that have never been made
to the trial court judge
the the precedent that could be created
uh would would be literally
everybody incarcerated pending
adjudication of criminal charges once
their bond reduced
this would create the precedent of of
allowing everyone to not even make an
argument to the trial court judge
and run to the supreme court and say i
want my bond reduced
none of these arguments the evidence
has ever been presented to the trial
court judge
right now we can't schedule the matter
for trial
because uh petitioner
is currently being evaluated for a
determination of his competency
to stand trial and to assist counsel in
that trial
so we're in a holding pattern um and and
i agree with mr allen uh
there was a there was a motion to
suppress there was a delay getting a
ruling on the motion distress
and then we were in the in the throes of
the
uh of the covet pandemic uh but the
motion was filed on july one
it would be my expectation if the
petitioner is deemed competent
that the trial court would schedule the
matter for trial
relatively quickly um again we're in
you know we're in unchartered territory
though with the
the getting the evaluation done uh it's
been it's been two months now
waiting for a report from forensic five
on the competence
and i'm not sure if that's because
they're waiting records
or they're or they're or they're having
trouble you know
with whatever process but um you know
we're we're waiting that determination
on competence um
before we can actually you know have a
trial um
finally the the um
mr allen advocated that that
petitioner has local ties we would we
would disagree
you know we would suggest local ties are
local ties to the community where he is
indicted
uh that would be seneca county uh not
franklin county franklin county
um is is in the state of ohio but it's a
significant distance
and if he would violate the terms of his
bond
the the relative ease
of a judge dealing with
a bond for somebody who is in franklin
county is much different than somebody
who is local
it also makes it much more difficult if
if the court
wants to monitor the person while
they're on bond
finally
the best evidence before this court
as to the appropriateness of the bond
for petitioner is the bond
for the driver of the car indicted for
the same offenses as set forth
in the certified copies that we provided
was the same amount
i would suggest that if
if a person was the driver of the car
maybe his bond could be
should be less in
in this case
because of the circumstances mr moyler
was arrested
much quicker and was charged and went
through the criminal justice system
in 2018 and at the time he went through
his bond was set at a million dollars
no 10 percent when mr um
muhammad petitioner comes to seneca
county in 2019
his bond was set at the exact same
amount
by the by the exact same magistrate at 1
million no 10 percent
based on the nature of the charges that
and the and the rules of criminal
procedure
so we would suggest that that is the
best evidence
that the bond is is not an abuse of
discretion
because it's the exact same bond that
the driver got
when he was went through the court
system in 2018.
thank you your honor thank you
mr allen i'll give you an opportunity
for a brief rebuttal
thank you um i think
uh it it does make a difference um
when you talk about the magistrate
setting a bond without council president
uh how he considered anything other than
the um co-defendant got this bond i
didn't
obviously didn't consider anything about
mr muhammad then he just
set the bond i think this
the respondent is is concerned about the
court
getting in the business of setting bond
or being
a watcher of common police court judges
i think that's a great idea certainly
as you look at the bail reform movement
as you look at trying to reform
the plea bargaining process i think more
defense attorneys should do this to try
and
have someone look at whether or not this
bond is set to make sure the person
shows up and is uh not a threat to the
community
or this is this bond was set to enforce
or force a plea in the case so
i think in this case
that there is little uh
doubt that a million dollar bond is not
something that he could afford
it's not something that would um
ensure his appearance at the pre-trials
motion hearings and the trial
and it's certainly not to ensure the
safety of the community so again we
would ask that you
uh reduce the bond and release mr
mohammed
your honor your honor yes sir if my
argument was was misunderstood i have no
objection to the supreme court or the
court of appeals
looking at bond i'm suggesting that it's
it's it's inappropriate
for the evidence being submitted to
this court was not presented to the
common police court judge
for his review and making a
determination first
uh your your it's my suggestion that
that you're second guessing
a trial court judge with information
that was never presented to that trial
court judge
thank you with that
uh i i believe uh we are done here this
morning
um my recommendation to the court will
be forthcoming
um and with that we stand adjourned
thank you judge
[Music]
[Applause]
