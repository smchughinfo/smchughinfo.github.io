well good afternoon afternoon everyone
today i'm wearing a tie from terra state
community college in
fremont terrace state offers more than
60 degrees and certificates and has been
educating students now
for more than 50 years we just learned
that the ohio department of
rehabilitation and corrections has
experienced a tragedy
to date around 10 a.m the correction
reception center received notification
dr craig cullen of lakewood was killed
the incident is unrelated to coben and
is under investigation
by the lakewood ohio police department
dr cullen
graduate of harvard and ucla a retired
lieutenant colonel for the us army
a 10-year employee for the ohio
department of rehabilitation and
corrections
i'm told that his work ethic and
dedication
uh to his job and the people was
unparalleled
80 years old 80 years old he drove from
lakewood
to the corrections center reception
center in orient
long long ways every day a four hour
round trip our deepest condolences go
out to his loved ones
and to those who worked with him
well we've talked for many months about
what happens when someone gets
coca-19 uh and
uh our doctors and our medical
authorities
continue to learn more every single day
um american journal of cardiology
published
an analysis last month that addresses
the impact
of coronavirus on the heart and so we
thought we would look at this
a little bit today through the eyes of
an expert
this issue also came up to this week in
some news
accounts involving the big ten's
decision not to
have fall sports so there's been
stories in in in the media in regard to
that
ohio state has been routinely testing uh
their athletes as part of their their
protocol
uh so today i'd like to introduce dr
kurt daniels who is a cardiologist
is going to share what they have been
seeing at ohio state about covet's
effects
on individuals and and also specifically
on
athletes dr daniels is director of the
adolescent
adult congenital heart disease program
and professor
professor of clinical internal medicine
and pediatrics at the ohio state
university
and nationwide children's hospital dr
daniel specializes
in congenital heart disease and sports
cardiology
dr daniels thank you very much for
joining us
hey thank you for having me well doctor
i wonder if you could just kind of tell
us a little bit about what
we know now uh in regard to the
coronavirus and what impact it does have
or
might have on on someone who who has the
coronavirus
sure absolutely um the concern of late
has been the diagnosis of myocarditis
with with coronavirus and myocarditis
is inflammation of the heart muscle
typically caused by
viruses this is not new to coronavirus
we've known about myocarditis
and viruses causing myocarditis for many
years and decades
but it's become heightened recently
because of coronavirus and there appears
to be
a somewhat higher rate of cardiac
involvement
causing myocarditis with coronavirus and
other viruses so far from the data we
have
and this is mostly in hospitalized
patients it's also important to know
about
myocarditis there's a wide range of a
clinical spectrum with the disease
process
you can have very mild myocarditis
affecting a small part of your heart
and having virtually no symptoms to
having a large degree of your heart
affected by
inflammation affecting the strength of
your heart and your heart even failing
and one of the concerns uh around this
process is arrhythmias
we know that if the heart is inflamed
that there's a chance of having
increased electrical activity of the
heart and this could cause
dangerous heart rhythm problems and even
sudden cardiac death
and doctor i wonder thanks for that
explanation
um and and so
do we know how often uh someone who has
chronovirus
it impacts their heart do we have any
data on that yet or not
well the most of the data we have is
from hospitalized patients and that
that's pretty clear and when you look at
samples
of hospitalized patients there's data
that would suggest as high as 20
of the hospitalized patients our sickest
patients with coronavirus
may have cardiac involvement as as
patients in the community or people in
the community with chronovirus
we know less about that there is
emerging data and we're trying to
analyze that data and trying to better
understand it
but we certainly don't know the impact
out in the community when people have
less symptoms or less affected by
coronavirus
now doctor i know you and i talked last
night and i know you were involved
in kind of monitoring some of the
athletes uh
and you know you uh have
described what i would call kind of a
vigorous
uh protocol in regard to testing and so
i wonder with the athletes
and so i wonder if you maybe can
describe for us without obviously using
any names or
or giving uh you know big numbers or
anything or small numbers but
just kind of describe what you all have
learned
during that that period of time sure
um well we've looked at a number of
athletes from various levels of
competition
that have come our way because of
coronavirus and the concern for the
heart
and we decided to do a very very
extensive protocol as as you
mentioned and we have found myocarditis
in athletes
through our testing the percent
continues to change as we see
more but it's somewhere around 10 to 13
of those we've tested um of various
levels again of competition uh
throughout
so so we do know that this does happen
um and it happens in the community with
athletes
um and we're still not sure again of the
overall impact of what that means and
again we continue to get more data but
but it certainly is something we are
finding uh so just
just so i understand and our viewers
understand dr um
you talk about 10 to 13 is that 10 to 13
percent
of those athletes young men and women
who actually tested positive
so is it 10 to 13 10 to 13 of those who
test positive
for the coronavirus had uh
this myocarditis there's a that's 10 to
13
of those that tested positive that were
sent our way
um so they're certainly ones that may
not have come our way so we don't know
the denominator in that group
but certainly from the ones we evaluated
with very sensitive testing
we found evidence of inflammation
uh and in those cases how what was the
range on that were those mostly mild or
how were they
they were all mild cases correct
i wonder if you could describe um let's
take this
obviously beyond the setting of ohio
state and the ohio state athletes that
were being tested and you all were
monitoring but let's take it out into
the
world of high school athletes
but also for anybody who who might
you know want to run at 25 years old 30
years old
and they came down with the coronavirus
what
what should they watch for if they know
that they've had the virus
and they're coming out of the virus um
in regard to the heart sure yeah the
reason why athletic competition in
athletes
is being mentioned um because we know
there's a risk with athletic competition
with myocarditis
there are what we call sudden cardiac
death registries and athletes that have
been well established
that have shown that one of the causes
is myocarditis and this is old
information that continues to again
evolve
outside of coronavirus so we know that
being an athlete and having high
intense competition and training
probably induces a higher level of
arrhythmia burden
that the the exciting of the heart the
stressing of the heart
and if the heart is vulnerable with
inflammation then there's a risk of a
dangerous heart rhythm problem
so it's not just athletes and those that
are in athletic competition but anybody
who
is at a high level of intense exercise
could be at risk
whether you're a triathlete or working
out at the gym or
whatever your competition or what you're
doing on your own you could potentially
be at risk because of the level of
activity
uh related to the inflammation and the
arrhythmia
so let's say let's just make up a case
let's say there's a
30 year old or or 15 year old either one
who has been diagnosed who's who's
been tested uh and found to have
coronavirus they
they come out of that um they feel
feel better uh what
is there is there a protocol that should
be followed in regard to specifically
their heart
just maybe stay focused on on this yeah
um
but i say first of all when you have
viral symptoms at early phase you should
rest
there there's there's data suggested in
that early phase
and the most significant phase of
inflammation it's important to rest and
not
try to physically exert yourself until
your viral symptoms
are gone i think for at least that
quarantine time and even after that uh
for weeks
you should be aware of symptoms um and
what i mean by that is cardiac symptoms
so if you ever develop chest pain
shortness of breath
trouble breathing with any activity
palpitations funny heartbeats
lightheadedness dizziness or passing out
obviously you should have some
evaluation so be aware
of symptoms you should gradually
increase your exercise activity
um and then and if you as you do that
again be aware of symptoms at any time
during that process you have symptoms
you should be evaluated
um so any significant cardiac symptoms
and even those that have significant
viral symptoms meaning prolonged fever
bed rest and we certainly in our
hospitalized patients were evaluating
their heart but but if somebody's at
home and really has significant viral
symptoms they may need a heart
evaluation before they go back to
rigorous activity but please be aware of
those symptoms
and have those symptoms evaluated before
you go back and gradually go back into
activity
and there's any kind of clearance you
know i talked last night maybe about a
clearance protocol
do you have any additional comments
about that i mean
well i think it's giving people guidance
i know the best advice is see their own
doctor but
um we do have people watching this and
and you have an opportunity to kind of
talk to them
so there's anything else that you know
as far as clearance before they go back
and go run their
five miles or whatever they're going to
do yeah i mean i think this
again is evolving as you as you pointed
out evolving science and we're learning
more
and then and there will be a need for
cardiac clearance
for many to go back to their activity
whether it's organized or unorganized
sports and that level of clearance
is dependent on the age of the patient
probably the activity they're doing and
their symptoms
and they're beginning there's there's
early protocols now and i call them
early because they probably will be
adapted over time as we get more
information
but there's protocols for kids and
adults that says this is how we best
today at least should clear them back to
activity and sport
and i think again as time goes on this
will continue to be adapted as we have
more information that level
of clearance and what is done is going
to be
determined by the provider again based
on age activity
and symptoms okay good doctor
thanks for coming thanks for sharing
this information with us
we appreciate it
eric we'll go look at the data slides
right now
uh our first one is kind of our regular
slide our key indicators
um cases
have gone down you know they've been
hovering around
twelve hundred uh the day before
yesterday was higher yesterday is
one thousand one hundred seventy eight
uh
cases that's a little bit below the 21
day average but really kind of hovering
right there
21 deaths 122 hospitalizations that is
up a little bit
and icu emissions is up a little bit as
well
eric we'll go to the next one we
continue to rank our counties this is
updated from uh tuesday
by highest occurrence and remember the
way we do this
we're trying to compare apples to apples
and
trying to adjust we do adjust for a
population by
county so what we're trying to see is uh
what is the intensity during the last
two weeks of the covet spread
and covet cases uh in the county
and so eric why don't you let's go over
to our
top ten uh
we'll usually read i think again again i
think what uh
mercer county is still number one
champaign county is is number two
in lawrence county three and dark county
number four
so the first four counties are what we
would normally consider rural counties
if you go through the rest of the list
you you do see lucas a bigger county in
franklin
but you also see perry county meigs
county and seneca county as well as
fairfield smaller
smaller counties so this is just one
more way to look at it
again it is not a long historical look
back
it is a look back for the last the last
two weeks and of course every day this
these numbers change
a little bit as we go back for the for
the 14 days but again it gives
gives you one other way besides the
color
uh to look at what's going on uh in
in the area in where you live eric let's
take a look at the next one
our ohio national guard continues uh
to go around the state and do what we
call pop-up testing
uh testing for one day going into
community
uh you'll see uh this week um
[Music]
had the opportunity to be in cincinnati
in gallia county athens
county cincinnati and dayton next week
a much more busier schedule bucyrus
cincinnati dayton avon lake cincinnati
youngstown avon lake again lima
cincinnati warren and middletown and so
again if you have
in your community if you believe that
there's additional testing that needs to
be done
the national guard can come in and do
that testing
eric let's go to our color map again
this is a new map for for today
and let me kind of kind of go through
through this
this week we have 12 red
counties three new counties have turned
red since last week the new counties two
of them are in southwest ohio
clermont county again they had one time
been read they're now read again
brown county again southwest ohio and
then
over in the eastern part muskingum
county
remaining as red counties this week are
kahaga erie fairfield franklin
licking lucas marion mercer and
montgomery county
seven of our red counties met fewer than
four indicators but are still
designated as red this is because
uh they are above 100 100 000
uh more more than 100 cases of
coronavirus per 100 000 in the past two
weeks that's the
that is the measure 100 additional cases
coronavirus per 100 000 in the past two
weeks
um have some good news allen and medina
counties are no longer red
and so we congratulate them and just
ask everyone to continue to wear the
mask and do what
they need to do to keep that down allen
county
dropped two indicators they fell off the
list for high incidence counties based
on the cdc's
uh definition medina county also moved
from the red alert to orange they're no
longer meeting the emergency
emergency department indicator which is
an early indicator uh
nine counties have dropped from orange
to yellow they are adams defiance fulton
henry knox lake
paulding pike and williams
let's talk a little bit about the red
counties will start in southern ohio
southeast ohio with brown county as read
for the first time
21 of their cases throughout this
pandemic have occurred in the last two
weeks
one-fifth while they've had a couple of
outbreaks the number of cases linked to
those outbreaks has been low which
indicates
uh significant community spread
throughout the county
uh clermont county now we saw cases
increased throughout june
with about 120 cases a week in early
july
this was followed by good news the
community was just starting to see those
cases come down
as we moved through july down to under
80 new cases in the third week of july
however the last two weeks we're seeing
cases creep back
up uh the last seven days of july had
101 cases
in addition to cases going back up we've
also seen increases in health care use
for patients with coca-19 now cuyahoga
county
they continue their steady decrease in
daily number of cases reported
they are at 102. so if they get below
100
they will move out of the red area so
very good news there
county has reported some outbreaks in
long-term care facilities and group
homes
erie county area is red because they
meet the cdc's threshold for high
incidents again high incidence is above
a hundred
uh they're at 105 cases per hundred
thousand residents in the past
two weeks they have gone down and that
is good news fairfield county
uh they are above a hundred they're 114
while the county had slightly fewer new
cases during the past week their numbers
remain
elevated franklin county also continues
as read this week because they meet the
cdc definition for a
high incidence their cases are in fact
dropping
but they're still in 126.
they drop from 142 to 126
per capita uh licking county still meets
the cdc's definition for high incidents
which kept them read this week
they only met two other indicators cases
per capita and percentage of cases in
non-congregate settings
lucas county 159 cases per
100 000 residents uh of course they meet
the definition of being over 100.
marion county meets the cdc's definition
for high incidence
they are at 101 so they're right on the
line there
but they're close to dropping off that
so we hope by
next week marion county cases will have
eased down
and marion county will no longer be read
mercer county again as we said
at 298 cases way above uh anybody else
uh and that's
that's that's that's the news there
unfortunately
so um significant community spread
uh is is taking place montgomery county
uh cases per hundred thousand down to
ninety four
uh that's been uh an improvement uh but
they still remain red this week why they
no longer meet the cdc's threshold for
high
incidence they meet four other
indicators they're one of two counties
that had increases in both their
emergency department and outpatient
visits during this reporting period
not good news because what that means is
those are the early early warning signs
the cases are going to start start to
creep up so that's
not good muskingum county as we said
first week is red they are at 62 cases
per 100 000
but they have other indicators that put
them this
in this category again for them
outpatient visits grew from an average
of four
uh visits on august 3rd to 9 on august
10th
so that percentage of cases increase is
certain
certainly not good we've tried to share
some stories
about how the viruses spreads
let me just share a few in clark county
a group of friends got together to play
cards a friend's home
now sadly seven individuals are in fact
testing positive
we're also continuing to see small
workplace outbreaks
where one member of the staff spreads it
to a group of co-workers in some of
these cases the businesses have had to
close
for cleaning or for staffing we've seen
this in new philadelphia and we've seen
it in dayton and we've seen it
in other parts of montgomery county as
well
we're going to continue to share these
stories again not to
be critical of anyone but rather just to
explain that these cases are spreading
and just kind of common
everyday occurrences when people let
their guard down don't wear a mask
don't do the social distancing and they
can occur among friends they can occur
among family members
eric let's go back to another map and
i've asked
our data team to kind of combine
something from the ohio department of
education
and the ohio department of health and so
if you will look at
the map that is up now and particularly
the one that's on your left
this is a a kind of an overlay map
and what we have done where you see
counties in
red with the with the red outline
those are counties that
this week are red some have been read
for a while some just
became red but these are our red
counties this week
overlaid inside of that or late inside
of that
is the department of education's
map um in regard to
which schools are coming back in person
so
let's start with the darkest color on
there
see how good my eyesight is but i would
call it dark blue
maybe dark blue
is fully remote so these are the school
districts that we know of right now
that have decided to be fully remote
the the uh the blue
um
what i would call the light blue is
hybrid which means they're coming back
uh partially uh in in school
and and partially remote
and the the ones that are coming back
full time
uh their plans to come back full time uh
that's sort of a green
uh if i can read that correctly and and
the only point is for everybody
from those areas to to look um
i i had some conversations with some
superintendents last week i'm going to
have some more conversations this
week and every school is making its own
decision
about whether to come back and which way
to come back
you know we've had long tradition in
this state of local local schools making
their own decisions families making
their own decisions
school boards making their own decisions
but if you look at the
back at the map for a moment eric
those that are red and are coming back
in person uh you know that is a
challenge and it's really it's a
challenge
not so much to the educators because i
after talking to a lot of
superintendents and principals and
teachers i think they're going to do a
bang-up job
to do everything they can to keep your
children safe for your grandchildren
safe when they go back in school
but i'm pointing this map out kind of
for us
for people in the community we have a
job to do
and our job to do is to slow down the
spread in the community so the school
can either open
or the school can stay open and i just
put these counties up because these are
the reddest county these are the red
counties these are the ones we're seeing
right now with with the most spread but
it's important it's an important
principle
i think for all of us whether we're
yellow county whether red county whether
in orange county
and that is we have an obligation to do
everything we can to slow down the
spread in our community so our kids can
go to school our grandkids can go to
school they can play sports
and they can do all the other things
that you know we
want them to do and the things that we
want them to get
out of school
on august 4th we announced that we're
going to make an order
uh in regard to kids in grades k
through 12 to our face coverings i know
i've talked to some superintendents
who've asked me when are we going to put
that up
it's coming up today so uh the mask
order for all our
educators and parents uh
coronavirus.ohio.gov
that that is coming up let me now turn
uh to a very important topic of minority
health
uh and issues of disparity
in april we formed a minority health
strike force to focus on the
disproportionate impact of the
coronavirus
on our minority communities in ohio the
group's mission has evolved over the
past
few months to examine broader health
disparities
in racial injustices today the group has
released its final report
and i want to thank the members of the
strikeforce for their hard work
their passion their commitment uh to
shedding light on the health disparities
just proportionately affecting people of
color
in ohio
it is wrong that in ohio today
the overall life expectancy of african
americans ohioans
is four years shorter than of white
ohioans
it's wrong that african-american ohioans
have a higher rate of heart disease
higher rates of hypertension and
diabetes
it's wrong that our african-american
citizens
are two and a half times more likely to
live in poverty
and african-american children in ohio
are three times more likely to live in
poverty
than their white brothers and sisters
the coronavirus has further laid bare
the disparities
african-americans who did today make up
about 14
of ohio's population represent 25
percent
25 percent of positive cova 19 cases
32 percent of coven 19 hospitalizations
and 19 percent of covet 19 deaths
at least six percent of the people who
have tested positive
for the virus in ohio or latino although
they make up
less than four percent of the state's
population
we have to do better we can do better
my inaugural address is governor i laid
out the ideals
that would guide our administration the
values
the principles that serve as a
foundation for what we try to do
every single day at that time in my
inaugural address
i said everyone no matter where they
were born or who their parents
are deserves the chance to succeed
a chance to get a good paying job
chance to raise a family a chance to
live
their version whatever that is of the
american dream
now to truly make change we need an
equitable health care system
we need thriving communities we need
improvements in quality of life
these are things that our health experts
call the social determinants of health
things that make up a big proportion and
of determining
how well we're going to do and whether
we're going to be well
throughout our lifetime the minority
health strike force
final report offers 34 recommendations
on the topics of dismantling racism
removing obstacles to public health
improving the social and economic
environment improving the physical
environment
and strengthening data collection to
better track
disparities i asked my senior leadership
team
i asked my members of the cabinet to
read this report and they have done so
i've asked them not just to read it but
to lay out a plan
where they in the world they occupy
in the position they occupy can do
better with their own employees
but also do better in whatever mission
they have
as a member of our cabinet in response
today
we are issuing ohio's executive response
a plan of action
to advance equity let me pull this up
this is sort of this is what it looks
like you'll have a chance to
pull this down on online
this is our administration's action plan
it's a beginning it's not an end it's
but trying to put in writing
some of the things that we believe we
can do that we can do
to change things for the better
it doesn't mean it's the end product
it's the beginning
we started when i was sworn in but this
puts some things in writing and says
these are some additional things that
we're going to do
and it will be a work in progress and we
will continue
on that throughout the duration of our
administration
because it really is true all of us all
of us can do more
um and just give me i'll just give you a
few examples
today i'm challenging our colleges and
universities and we've got some great
ones in ohio
to come up with ways to recruit more
african-americans to become teachers
to become mentors to be in our school
system
very very important i'm challenging the
department of jobs and family services
to do more
with foster care look our foster kids
are particularly our african-american
ones spend much too long a time in
foster care
they languish in foster care longer than
their white brothers and sisters do
and that is not good if you look at the
numbers it is very sad
while 16 of ohio's child population is
african-american
the population of ohio's foster care
system is 31 percent
african-american among children who stay
in foster care more than two years
one-third of them are african-americans
again
even though african-americans children
represent only 16 percent of the child
population
of ohio they are not adopted enough
they languish in foster care uh and i'm
challenging our team
uh to do more about this we've done some
things
we have to do more we are making a
commitment to get kids out of foster
care and into homes
black or white by finding out what the
problems are in the system
and trying to fix that ohio department
jobs and family services
is reaching out to minorities who have
experienced the children's
system themselves the child service
system themselves to better understand
their experiences and to work in
partnership to develop
systemic solutions to this racial
disparities
we hope to have a final report on that
to share with you by the end of the year
this work will enhance the efforts
currently underway by our children's
services transformation advisory council
which traveled the state last year
hearing from children and families
impacted by the foster care system
collectively their recommendations will
help to reform ohio's foster care system
to ensure better futures
for all our children uh in ohio
i'm going to turn it over for a moment
to john husted john is in
in columbus john's going to talk about
an issue that that he and i have
talked a lot about uh and our cabinet is
focused on
and that has to do with
african-americans who are in business
uh giving them a better opportunity to
grow their business and attracting
more african americans to to go into
business john
yes thanks governor dewine appreciate it
the economic team we've been engaged
with them through this process
and they are accepting your challenge to
do better as it relates to
supporting african-american businesses
and careers
in the state the jobs ohio team the
development services agency have been
hard at work
because we know that health outcomes are
tied to economic outcomes
and while has been a popular place and a
great place for innovators and
entrepreneurs
we know that in the minority community
potential business when
men and women have struggled to get a
foothold
the three keys to success in the modern
economy i
think people widely embrace this is that
it's capital
it's innovation and it's talent these
are so important
for success in business this is true in
every community but it's particularly
acute
in the african-american community we
need to do more to improve access to
capital
working to get more african-americans
involved in financial institutions and
to create frankly
more minority-owned and operated banks
and financial institutions in our state
to promote the development of
technology-based businesses
in the minority communities and to focus
on technology skill development and stem
skills because those are critical to
having economic success in the modern
economy
to deal with the added challenges that
are presented by covid we
we you will remember that the governor
and i announced the creation of the
office of small business relief
within the development services agency
and this coordinates resources for small
and medium-sized companies
during this time this is a critical time
some of these businesses are struggling
particularly small businesses
minority-owned businesses women-owned
businesses
and we have to have this proper support
there and they've been working with the
small business development
administration the small business
development centers
in the minority business development
centers to access expertise
during this difficult time to get the
market research and the tools that can
benefit these businesses
and also while the minority health
strike force was meeting
during this time we were active in
creating the ohio minority micro
enterprise grant to help to help create
a bridge during the pandemic
this is specifically to provide 500
minority
and women-owned businesses with up to
ten thousand dollars in grants
we have already received 700
applications
so we know it's popular we know it's
helpful
and that program is moving forward but
governor
this is just the beginning i know as
we've talked about this that people have
been
across the administration embraced the
idea
on the talent front especially to help
build more tech skills to help build
more stem skills which will serve to
create new
health care job opportunities which are
important when we're talking about
minority health
and also new business opportunities so
uh your team your economic team
is ready to go to work on this have been
at work and
and we accept the challenge governor and
and
i'll turn it back over to you good
thanks john very much
very very important um in regard to more
equality and policing
we've already talked we took a whole
program
uh press conference and talked about
that we have laid out to the general
assembly a comprehensive plan
that will work that will make things
better bring about more justice
and i'm asking them today to pass it
it's there
it's good we've worked with some of the
members of the general assembly on this
it needs to pass i'm also challenging
our department of health
uh in an ohio environmental protection
agency to do more address the lead paint
problem in ohio i've talked a lot about
this in the past
i won't spend time today but it's wrong
it's wrong we have to change
this it's crazy uh that in the year 2020
we still have children who are being
poisoned by lead pain
infant mortality huge disparity and
infant mortality
between african-american babies uh and
white babies
huge disparity uh in the mortality of
the mother
and that both of those simply have to
change we're doing work
but we need to do more and that is our
commitment
one of our commitments today also is the
creation of the governor's equity
advisory board
the idea behind this is to have a
permanent group working with us
people brought in from the outside
people not necessarily in government
not in government people who bring a
wide array of experiences
uh who can advise our cabinet members
and who can advise me
in things that we need to do to make
this a more just
society this is a permanent ongoing
group to help guide us as we address the
underlying conditions and root causes
contributing disparities in life and
health in ohio
with me today is alicia nelson alicia is
the director of recovery ohio
she was in the attorney general's office
with
me where she headed up our what we call
our heroin unit so her work has been a
great deal of work has been
in regard to recovery great deal of work
in regard to fighting
the opioid epidemic she's been working
directly with the minority health strike
force and she's here today to talk about
our new equity advisory board
so alicia thank you thank you very much
for
for being with us thank you governor it
is
been my pleasure to serve the residents
of ohio through my work
on the minority health strike force the
strike force members have brought great
energy and passion to this work and
we're grateful
to their contributions and service
governor we we often hear you talk about
action
and how important it is to create real
and meaningful change
for the people in our state and so i
like to spend a little time this
afternoon
sharing one piece of how this work will
be implemented
the next step in recommendation one or
commitment number one
in the executive response
is to create the governor's equity
impact board
the board will work to improve state
efforts to dismantle racism and promote
health equity
the board's members will draw on the
expertise
of current that currently exists within
ohio's communities of color
african american and hispanic americans
asian americans who speak a
multitude of languages and live within
our state
will represent diverse viewpoints from
sectors like
education health care public and private
business
community organizations and members of
the criminal justice community
it will be important for the board to
provide continuity to the work we do
it will also be important for this group
to advise the state on how we move
forward
and utilize all that can be made
available to communities across the
state
to promote wellness in all of our
residents
and all of us finally and most
importantly the members of this group
will hold us accountable
to our commitments to address equity
thank you for the opportunity to share
this important work
and i know it'll have in a lasting and
positive impact on community
communities of color so thank you
governor director thank you very much
we appreciate your your good work i know
you've worked very very hard on this let
me also introduce
someone who has also worked very hard on
this a member of my cabinet
purcell you there you are or cell you're
there
michelle mcelroy she's our director of
aging
she's got uh as alicia does she has a
big job
um she's also with me in the attorney
general's office she held up
headed up our elder justice initiative
then
she's been working directly with
minority strike force
she's with us today to really kind of
represent our cabinet
and to talk about some of the specific
commitments that our directors
have made so marcel
thank you good to have you here and
we'll let you take off and
talk a little bit about what you and the
members of the cabinet are doing
okay so thank you governor and thank you
for the opportunity to be a part of this
really
critical work i'm so appreciative to
work with such a wonderful
cabinet every day of their hard work and
the transformative ways and ideas that
they bring to the table
it doesn't matter if it's midnight if
it's early morning
each of them will certainly answer the
call and they don't
only answer the call they listen and
then they
act and i think about some of the work
that they've done
looking at our health care system
working to make it more accessible
making it more meaningful to consider
telehealth the steps that have been
taken quickly to enable ohioans to stay
safe
and to still receive critical needs met
with minimal reduction
during covet with epa our water system
and lead abatement efforts
realizing those things need attention
they weren't afraid to take action
our highways we knew our infrastructure
needed attention and things were overdue
and so we took on that work and again i
get excited when i think about mental
health and the attention we're bringing
to those issues
attention that's necessary for people
that have been left in the shadows
far too long because of stigma
and director hall working on a benefits
bridge to address a problem that has
existed for so
long people have been pennies away from
having their livelihood cut because of
rules
with director hall and the governor we
know that we can do
better and then general harris
helping in such an incredible way now
during covet
surging into food banks helping with our
nursing facilities
and helping with the civil unrest we've
had
throughout our state i could say so many
things
about members of our cabinet uh and i
just want people to know
how privileged i feel in working with
them but
what's important is i want you to
understand and appreciate
what this cabinet is willing to do and
lean in to do
and so with that i want to first extend
grateful appreciation to members of the
minority health strike force
for the report and regarding the report
in our cabinet's response we know that
ohio's public health entities have long
advocated for the basic needs of ohioans
they have spoken about the impacts of
social determinants of health
social determinants are those things
that can contribute to our future health
and opportunities
social determinants basic rights and
they extend far beyond our basic needs
and they are complicated and we know
that ohio's public officials must join
together to address the historic
decisions
that were made decisions that continue
to have an upstream impact
on disadvantaged ohioans that can begin
at birth and years later
can result in adverse health outcomes
so in terms of the report and the
initial thoughts of the cabinet
and what our agencies can individually
pursue
as the governor mentioned we first came
together
and we looked at this with a critical
eye and with the eye of opportunity
what we understood was that there were
areas that we could impact
within our respective departments our
commitments around
revolve around our people the state's
workforce to drive change
our commitments revolve around our
policy and programs to advance
equity in our work and our public
service
to achieve more equitable accessible and
culturally competent public
services and there is work already
occurring and work to be done
in addition to the 10 commitments within
the response
are actions identified by the cabinet
that can make
a difference that are so important to
the changes that need to happen
for example the ohio department of
transportation will be focusing on ways
to incentivize the ability
for transit authorities to provide
on-demand transit
for healthcare-related trips and on the
internet front
which we all know provides us with
opportunities and access
the ohio department of transportation is
also working with innovative ohio to
explore
options to expand broadband to
underserved areas
with particular focus on rural schools
and homes
by placing fiber optic cables and
interstate right-of-ways
for public health the ohio department of
health has a state health improvement
plan which we
often refer to as the ship and the ship
provides state and local health
departments and hospitals
with a menu of strategies to improve the
performance on public health priorities
for example to affect adverse childhood
experiences
and kindergarten readiness both which
have long-term
impacts on health outcomes the ship
features strategies in early childhood
home visiting
and early childhood education and
certainly
i would be remiss not to mention within
my agency the ohio department of aging
we've been working with experts across
ohio to develop a strategic action plan
on aging
a plan that we refer to as the sapa and
it includes strategies that will be
implemented around
community conditions including economic
stability housing transportation and
elder abuse and neglect and exploitation
it focuses on health behaviors including
physical activity and nutrition and
access to care
including long-term home and
community-based supports
and workforce capacity we know that in
all the work that we do a coordinated
approach has to be taken across all
sectors to improve and achieve health
equity and so the ship and the sapla
for example working together include a
cross-sector
effort to improve house quality and
affordability
including reducing housing cost burden
for those most
at me and then i also want to mention
one other
good example because there are so many
to demonstrate our commitment
within the ohio department of
rehabilitation and correction they have
utilized what's known as the
health care effectiveness data and
information set or the hedis measures
and they use these to help internally
evaluate the quality of diabetic care
for incarcerated ohioans
the hedis dataset are one of
healthcare's most widely used
performance
improvement tools this is an example of
the type of objective measure
that can be used to evaluate performance
so these are just a few of many efforts
that are underway or planned
and as the response explains there will
also be a strategic plan
and a these elements are critical to
moving the needle on the systemic issues
and complex issues of disparity
our planning will reveal the most
impactful
and those factors that we can influence
we know that it will require a major
shift a shift buying between all levels
of government and among all ohio
communities
but we are up for the challenge we are
up
to moving the needle on this critical
issue and i want to say
thank you governor for allowing me to
represent the cabinet here today
to be able to express the energy the
passion
and the will of the cabinet to move this
forward
director mcelroy thank you very very
much i appreciate you
and appreciate director nelson uh i
appreciate what you both have done
i know you worked very hard on this uh
but
uh you know as we've talked about our
work is just beginning
we have more work to do the
goals that you all put together i know
you both
directly involved in writing this is a
beginning
but no one should think that it's the
end on be all you have
more things to do the group that you're
putting together
to work directly with you i think will
give you some good continue to give you
good feedback and good guidance
and we'll keep keep focusing so thank
you thank you both very
very very much
you know there are
racial disparities in this country the
racial disparities in ohio we've we
talked about
them certainly in health
education housing um
and we could go on and on there are many
causes for this
certainly racism is is one of one of the
causes sometimes it's systemic racism
sometimes it's very overt uh sometimes
it's more subtle
but sadly in 2020 racism does still
exist in this country we have an
obligation
to look at these racial disparities
and say that's not right
we have to do everything within our
power
to deal with this it's incumbent i think
upon all of us
to do that we've talked today about some
of the ways that
that we're trying to do that but
there'll be more things
and this is a it really is a work in
progress
there are racial disparities in so many
different areas
and health and education racism
is a public health crisis this is
something that
we have to work on every day
it really goes back to what i said
when i was sworn in as governor
and that simply is our dream should be
that every child in ohio
wherever they live whatever their
background
whatever their race
they should have the chance to live the
american dream and we need
to do everything we can to help them
have that chance
that's really what our job is our job is
to help create that opportunity
put them on a level playing field making
sure they get the education
that they need making sure the barriers
that are out there
that are caused by racism or other
barriers
are knocked down so every child has that
opportunity
let me open it up for questions
governor our first question is from
laura hancock cleveland.com
hello governor hello
hello
i guess we're switching over there you
go you're on
oh i think the wrong laura is muted
uh oh can you hear me
there we go okay um governor dewine
um given the anxiety that president
trump has created for voters
about whether the post office can get
ballots delivered on time
do you agree with the decision by
secretary of state larose
to ban election boards from using more
than one drop box
so that people can deliver their
absentee ballots themselves
well first of all i think secretary
larose is doing a good job
i don't have a comment about that
particular decision
the former secretary of state to my
lieutenant governor maine
in a moment but as far as
getting ballots in
we have four weeks in ohio um
where you can get an absentee ballot and
you have no you have to give no reason
you're just one absentee ballot
we've done this for a long time we know
how to do it
i would expect more and more ohioans
this year
would be getting their ballots and
sending them in absentee so i you know i
think the system will work
people have the opportunity if they
don't want to do that they can get 13
hours on election day
sort of the old-fashioned way and they
can show up they also
have opportunities uh uh other days to
go directly to the board of elections
and vote directly there
so there's many options for every ohioan
and so i'm i'm don't believe that we're
going to have a problem i don't feel
we're going to have a problem in
in ohio at all we know how to do this
and
i i think again because the coronavirus
people are going to be more incentivized
maybe to do this earlier and as frank
larose said
you know do it early you know get your
application in
and uh you'll get you'll get that uh
early on you can mail it and you'll be
done with it and
it's it'll be good so i don't know john
do you have anything i don't know if
you're still online here
yeah sure governor i would just remind
folks we know what the rules are
uh you can request an absentee ballot
now you'll get it a month before the
election
you fill it out mail it in you have a
month to vote without ever leaving home
uh
in ohio i've always said it's easy to
vote and hard to cheat
uh the rules that we have successfully
run elections throughout
the last 10 15 years and work very well
are are pretty much intact there will be
more drop boxes
there'll be a drop box in every county
and every board of election uh
this thing should run smoothly we should
all
just focus on on
making sure that we're being proactive
and doing this stuff in advance and not
waiting to the last minute and if we do
that we won't have a problem
okay next question questions from
christian houser at wkrc in cincinnati
hey sir um a temporary injunction has
allowed basketball games to be played in
warren county in our area
what's the latest on rules concerning
high school football and do you worry
that if you don't come up with the plan
soon you could see a lawsuit against the
health orders there and
a temporary injunction placed by a judge
that would allow
football to take place well let's let's
take the
warren county case that case is under
appeal
look this is very different different
than
high school athletes playing what this
is is bringing
a lot of people in
many from out of state who will stay a
weekend
who will play a number of games uh with
different teams
so you'll have the intermixing of
numerous games going on
and one one uh athlete may be competing
in
a number of different games for that
weekend that is just not a good idea
you know i don't know anybody that
thinks that's a very good idea from a
public health point of view
and the spread of the coronavirus
now we're going to have an announcement
on
tuesday lieutenant governor and i are
going to make about
high school sports
we've been working with the ohio
athletic association
high school athletic association to get
it right
to provide guidelines to make it as
safe as possible
i have great deal of confidence in the
coaches
who who are out there in fact we're
going to set up a call and
talk with some of the coaches in the
next few days i hope to talk to all the
coaches because they
they really have the opportunity not
just in practice and not just in the
game
to impress upon their athletes and young
men and women
the importance of keeping the distance
and and
being safe um but it's also important
what young people do when they're not
playing
uh when when they're they're home when
they're out and about uh
and so i think that having the coaches
focus on that uh
you know we always look to our coaches
for leadership and this is
in the era of the pandemic uh leadership
in fighting the coronavirus is probably
their most important job
uh this year so we'll have an
announcement on tuesday
a little preview uh you know this is a
decision that's going to be made
by parents it's going to be a decision
that's going to be made by schools
they're gonna make make those those
decisions
um we're going to restrict uh
the number of fans uh we want the
athletes
to compete we want the young people to
have their season
but we want to do it as safely as
possible and so
this will be a little disruptive for
some people but what we want to make
sure
is that the parent parents
people who are uh you know mean a lot to
that particular
child uh have the opportunity to see
them uh and then for the rest of us
you know we'll have to hear about the
game uh or maybe they'll
it'll be uh you know we can pick it up
on the internet
uh youtube uh but it's it's about the
kids
and so we'll have all the details we're
working out the details uh
this weekend for for every one every one
of the sports
so that will will be coming um
we look forward to tuesday and we'll
have we'll have it done this weekend
get it done this weekend we hope and
then we'll be able to announce
everything in more details on on tuesday
governor your next question is from
kevin landers at wbns 10 tv in columbus
hi kevin
we'll come back to kevin uh our next
question is from andy chow
at ohio public radio and television
hi governor andy on on the topic of
equity and disparity um when it comes to
what the task force
looked into um did the did the group
look into
the state's current regulations and
health orders on businesses
to find out if there are enough
protections in place
for industries that tend to have more
people of color
as employees are there enough
protections
uh for those employees in those sectors
uh i am not aware that that was done it
could have been done i'm just not aware
of that but that is something that we
we should in fact look at look at um
so this is something that arcell and
alicia and the two directors
you know i know will will take with the
new group that's starting up and that
can be
the first uh first thing to look at i
think it's a good idea
we'll go back to uh kevin landers at
wbns
sorry about that governor after the
fourth of july holiday weekend we saw a
spike in cases i believe it was the
highest spike we saw with labor day now
25 days away
what will the state do to protect
ohioans after a holiday like that
is a state home order any possibility
you know we're going to continue to
monitor the numbers
you know as i look at these numbers
every day there's good news and there's
bad news
the bad news is we've got very very
significant spread in some of our rural
counties not in some
other ones not so much
our urban areas are tending down but as
mayor ginth and i were talking this
morning
you know they're still high they're
above 100
in most of our cities uh and that's just
it's just at
a dangerously high level all it means is
the indicators aren't going up but
they're already at a high they're
already at a high level
uh so look as we go forward
with students let's take columbus with
students coming back 45 000 students
coming back
uh that's just at ohio state and then
the other
colleges and universities in in the area
plus k through 12.
so you know look there's certainly more
opportunity for spread
so the beginning of school creates that
opportunity that's why
we've you know have been pretty
stringent
strict in regard to the mass wearing in
school
both the teachers as well as the
students social distancing
all of these things and we're working i
know the schools are working directly
with their local health departments to
stay very very close
so that once there is a an outbreak in
one of the schools that
action can be taken so labor day is a
ways away
not not ready to make any kind of uh
decision about anything else that we
would do we're going to continue to
you know watch watch things and
again a lot of it comes back to simply
what we do
and there's frankly a limit uh to
you know what we can regulate i mean i
would remind everyone that there still
is a 10 person limit now there's some
exceptions yes
uh but if you want to stay safe
wear a mask keep your distance uh
use good sanitation with your hands
stay outside as much as you can and
those are all things that that really
really certainly certainly make a
difference but stay away from large
crowds
even when those crowds are made up of
members of your family or
or or friends it just is not it's just
it's not safe
uh the virus has spread too much in
in the communities and we don't know who
has it
that's the nature of it
governor your next question is from
scott hallas at the zinnia daily gazette
hey governor how you doing thanks for
taking mike
um so you said an announcements coming
tuesday regarding sports but you said
there's going to be limited fans
and you're working with the coaches and
and you know the coaches and the schools
are going to decide
so it sounds like there will be football
we just don't know to what extent
yeah we'll get more into that on tuesday
but
you know our goal is to have this
decided
by parents number one and number two by
school officials
local health departments all of that
interplay
and so these are decisions that are
going to be made
and again you give me an opportunity to
say something again scott and that is
what goes on in the school
and what goes on with the athletes is
directly related to what goes on in the
community
if you want your son if you want your
daughter to play sports
uh if you want them to have any other
extracurricular activities whether it is
banned or whether it's cheerleading
whether it is debate whether it is
speech whatever
goes along with school all these
experiences that are great experiences
the ability of that school to stay open
and the ability of your children to play
sports
is directly dependent on what's going on
in the community
and it just is and and so we all just
need to be in this together
we we want our kids to to be able to
have that experience
but you know it won't last uh
it won't last unless we slow this
this coronavirus down and uh it's not
just the red counties the red counties
are the ones on high high alert
in regard to that um but it's you know
it's it's every county what goes on in
that community just really impacts and
we can control that
we control we control by what we do
governor your next question is from max
philby at the columbus dispatch
hi governor i've got a two-parter for
you today on masks
one how will the state enforce mass
squaring at polling places during the
election this fall
and secondly when it comes to masks in
schools do children still need to wear
them
even if they're socially distanced
uh the answer to the second one is yes
uh
but obviously there's some exceptions if
your child is outside and they're
socially distancing
would not have to wear a mask in the
order you'll see the order it'll be out
it'll be online the next several hours
and you will you will see see that um
and ultimately look this is going to
come down to the teachers and the
teachers are going to be the ones who
are going to deal with
with with the young the young child just
as they deal with the child for
everything else
um look as far as polling places um
you know i agree with what the secretary
said the
you know we have an order the people
were masked um
that applies everywhere you know
when it fits within the order so yeah
people people need to wear masks but
we do not expect and we would not want
or anybody who works at the polls to be
put in a position
where they have to tell somebody oh you
can't vote
unless you have a mask on we're not
going to do that
that is a basic right maybe that person
who walked in
has a reason for not wearing a mask
that's a that's a health reason but we
can't put our poll workers in that
position
this is a very very important right we
would hope that people who go in and
vote would be respectful the poll
workers particularly who were there for
13 hours and
longer than that they're seeing people
for 13 hours but
now i think i think look the secretary
of state i think is
is right on point
next question is from jeff radick at
wsyx in columbus
afternoon governor a lot of talk today
of course about uh health
crisis and we've been talking about
covert for months
this summer in the capital city uh in
columbus we have a crisis of violence
which of course is contributing to uh
health as well and i know you say many
times that you speak with mayor ginther
here regularly
at the same time his administration has
quite a split
with quite a high profile split with the
police union here
does the state have a role in smoothing
that relationship
does your administration have a role in
trying to cut down
on the violence and the assaults in
columbus
yes here's what we can do i presented to
the legislature
as part of our strong ohio bill a very
significant
part of that bill it doesn't get written
about a lot
but it is something that i believe every
chief of police
at least of a major city in ohio agrees
with and that is a violent offender
a repeat violent offender who has long
ago
lost his it's usually his right to have
a gun
when they are found with a gun in
possession of a gun
in absolute violation of the law the
judge should have the ability to
put them away for a long time if we can
do that
if we can pass this and give this to our
prosecutors
and give this to our sheriffs and give
this to our police departments
particularly in our cities where we're
seeing just horrible carnage
if we can get that passed that will be a
very very significant tool it won't
solve every problem
but i'll tell you when you talk to
chiefs of police
in cities what they tell you is we know
basically who the repeat violent
offenders are if we
get them off the street just get them
out
and and you know it's usually not a huge
number of people
you know some place like lima
springfield
mid-size maybe 20 people uh might be
more than that in columbus but it's a
relatively small number of people you
get rid of them
and frankly the violence goes down and
then you don't have five-year-old
children who are killed
because they were in the wrong place at
least they had the right to be in their
home
but somebody shot and aimed at somebody
else and ended up killing the child so
yeah it's a
it's a big problem we've seen this
violence
escalate and we need to solve it and we
i've sent to the general assembly a very
very
well thought out uh provision and i
didn't write at all look we had
prosecutors look at it we had
police look at um it needs to pass
so yes there is things that we can do
next question is from jesse ballmert of
the cincinnati enquirer
hi governor my question is why has ohio
not released the number of deaths at
nursing homes by facility
it's something that states like kentucky
and even the cdc have provided
i guess why is this not information that
relatives or people looking at nursing
homes should have
access to well i thought we were
releasing them
and if we're not let me let me check and
see if there's any legal reason we can't
do that
i know we went through this discussion a
couple months ago i thought we
were getting information out um
let me let me see and i'll report back
on tuesday
thank you next question is from marty
schleyden
at ohio capitol journal
good afternoon governor good morning um
i want to give you another
crack at this notion that a coronavirus
bill should have
money for state and local governments
a hold up between the white house and
congressional democrats is the democrats
are asking for 900 billion dollars
do you agree with that ask or do you
think any money should be provided
if so at what level marty
i i spent 20 years in the united states
congress i had my chance to be there and
to vote and to have an opinion
let me just talk as a representative of
the state
and representative of of my friends who
run
cities and villages and townships and
counties
um this coronavirus
is been devastating to many many many
people
one of the huge fears i think we all
have
is that excuse me
is that the cities are going to run low
on money for police
city's going to run low on money
for fire um these are these are big
concerns
uh there should be a concern about where
we're going to be in the state in regard
to education look we
we've had we took we made some cuts we
didn't like
making them i'll guarantee you uh but we
made them because we had no assurance
that we would
be able uh to to if we didn't make the
cuts to be able to sustain the level
that we were spending we knew we
couldn't so these are
important things having flexibility is
important
as i look towards the future in regard
to what we're going to have to do in
ohio
as i've said we need to double and then
we need to double again our testing
we've come up uh 22 000 i think
something like that today but
look we need to double that and then we
need to double it again that's not going
to be cheap i mean we're trying to do as
cheaply as we can we're trying to build
our own infrastructure
but that's going to cost money so look
all those things are important
um you know there's a bill to be had out
there i'm confident that there can be
a bill i think what the president did
was the right thing the president tried
to move the debate
and he came out with a proposal and said
hey you guys aren't going to move i'll
move
and but we all know that executive
orders particularly in this area of
spending
are blunt instruments and it's much
better if congress can
can do what only congress can do and
that's pass a bill
and get it done so uh i i hope that
they'll be able to do that
we have you know basic public service
services that are at stake uh what else
is at stake is our ability to test
and these are essential i mean it goes
back to and if we
we have to stay on top of the corona
virus we have to try to keep it down
if it rares up too much you're going to
see what's happened in
in some of the southern states where the
economy starts going back and pulled
back because people are afraid
so it all is important and uh we need
the help and we need a bill
next question is from molly coweek at
whio in dayton
hi governor we've had some local
outbreaks in the miami valley most
recently 64
cases at a home in dark at a nursing
home in dart county are you concerned
some of the relaxed visitation rules
have led to any of these outbreaks
yeah let me just first say that a
nursing home can in all fairness they
can have an outbreak and still be doing
everything right
without commenting about any particular
case
i've charged our department uh to
to again review sanitation to go back
and look at this uh in the nursing homes
we are now started on a new program of
testing
if you remember we had the national
guard testing in our nursing homes
we now have a new protocol where we're
requiring every nursing home basically
to do their own testing
that testing has to occur every two
weeks frankly i would like to get it
down to every seven days we're gonna
start at two weeks
uh and then get the capacity up we're
gonna do that uh what's happening is
we've arranged the nursing homes
uh you know basically to do their own
swabbing
uh the ohio national guard now instead
of doing testing
the ohio national guard is doing the
logistics which simply means
you know taking that those swabs from
from
the samples from the nursing home
directly to the lab
uh it's a very com complicated complex
because we have nursing homes all over
we have labs all over us trying to match
them up and the guard is doing that
and let me just say to the guard you're
doing a great job uh and we we have
kicked into that phase of it so
more testing in our nursing home more
testing
more tracing in our nursing homes more
emphasis on sanitation
next question is from laura caso at wkyc
in cleveland good afternoon governor i'd
like to talk about the state mass
mandate that went into effect
some time ago yesterday daily numbers
well above
a thousand today 1178 cases
you mentioned three more counties in red
today when you look at those numbers
do you stand by your mask mandate do you
truly feel it's been effective
to this point
well masks are effective and and we've
seen a decline
in the parts of the state where they've
been used the most
and that is our urban areas uh we put
those mass orders in
earlier uh we went to the red counties
most of them at that time were urban
areas and so now we're
continuing to see a decline in fact you
know we've seen a decline
where some of these counties are going
off-red
we saw the improvement that was made in
hamilton county for example
we've seen franklin county come down
we've seen cuyahoga county come down
so these counties are these urban
counties are coming down
that's where the mask wearing is the
most prevalent
we've seen where the mask wearing is not
as prevalent we've seen
these numbers go up now it's not as
simple as that there's a lot more issues
i'm sure involved but that certainly is
one so yeah
you know as doctor said yesterday um
you know she listed the most important
things in order
and you notice the first thing she said
was mask second thing was distance
uh and on on from there so yeah look
we're seeing where these incidents are
occurring we're seeing where people are
getting
getting um the covert and many times
it's where people are letting their
guard down they're not wearing a mask
they're not distancing
uh they're among friends they're among
family and
they kind of let their guard down so
yeah mask work we know they work
um and when you when you marry that mask
with distance
when you put those two things together
uh it's a
it's a tough uh tough one-two uh
punch combination to beat
next question is from adrian robbins at
wcmh
in columbus hi governor
i've heard from several teachers and
parents in red counties who are
concerned their schools are reopening
fully uh do you believe that the county
is in the red they should be reopening
five days a week
and will you be willing to step in if we
do see a spike and it seems schools are
open
in unsafe environments yeah look i was
asked that question by some
superintendents who asked me you know
will you guarantee that you won't ever
go in and step in i said look i no i
can't do that
that would be irresponsible but what we
want to do is allow this
the local community to to have their say
on this
see how it works what we've tried to do
and i've done today and i'm going to do
tomorrow and
do every day i'm talking to
superintendents but i'm also talking to
people out in the communities
is if you're a red county um
you know you've got to get those numbers
down
the spread that occurs in your county is
going to screw
occur in your school and so that
decision that threshold decision
about whether or not they go remote they
go hybrid they go in person
we're still leaving that with with the
local school but we're gonna monitor it
we'll see what's happening um
and look we can see some things in
indiana
indiana is a little bit ahead of us a
few weeks ahead of us
in opening schools at least in some of
their districts we got to watch it
what's going on in indiana
we got to watch what's going on in other
states and then when our schools start
to open we got we got to watch them very
very carefully um so
look i mean this is the local
communities have historically governed
this in ohio
um we're gonna let them start we're
gonna see how
how this works and and but we were
saying to the people in the community
you've got to understand your school is
not an island it's not
separate it is a part of the community
and it will reflect what you're doing in
the community and if you're not wearing
a mask in your community
if you're not slowing the virus down it
will not slow down in your school
um and look look we've got we got
teachers
young people maybe don't show the uh the
covet
uh you know don't have the symptoms many
times
uh but the 50 year old teacher may
um you know the custodian may
person in the kitchen may so
look we we have a lot at stake the
schools have a lot at stake and i and i
know everybody in the school knows that
i mean every superintendent i've talked
to has talked about their personnel
and their concern about the personnel
and they're going to do everything they
can
to to protect them
next question is from jim province at
the toledo blade
hello governor uh thanks for this again
um you've made it clear previously that
your face mask order for the general
public allows
generally for coverings that cover both
the nose and the mouth
including bandanas and scarves but we're
hearing from at least one school
district that is prohibiting the use of
bandanas and neck gators
why is there a difference between what
is required for the general public
and what is being required in at least
some schools
um i would think that that's a decision
being made by the school
um you know
i'm not i'm not aware that we've we've
changed any kind of guidance
for that i'll check but i don't think
anybody in
health department has changed guidance i
mean look what evolves
the science evolves and you know i i'm
having read every single study that's
been done in regard to
you know there are some masks or clearly
provide more protection than others but
the experts will tell you look
you know instead of getting hung up on
which kind of mask and then people not
wear any masks let people wear a mask
you know and they can be homemade they
can be all all kinds of all kinds of
things but it's it's it's getting that
blockage
uh you know um
you know what we're seeing in in some
medical facilities
uh is we're seeing a mask and shields
uh that medical personnel are wearing a
mask
then they're wearing a shield on on top
of that
so again you know we let the
local communities work that out we don't
micromanage
it down to that level but everyone
wearing a mask
will make a difference everyone trying
to keep the social distance will make a
big difference
governor the next question is the last
question and it's from farnu
miri at the associated press
hi governor thank you so much for taking
the time today um you stated today that
you believe racism is a public health
crisis
and you outlined the data that supports
that in the last hour
but as we speak two concurrent
resolution bills
in the general assembly are being
stalled and
do you have plan to make any
recommendations to the house and senate
to prioritize
that declaration like michigan has done
similarly to how you mentioned that
you're going to prioritize equity and
policing to the general assembly
those resolutions
have been sometimes as i looked at the
resolution of resolutions i think i only
looked at one
you don't have a lot of different things
in them you know what i said today is
what i've said in the past
we have disparities in in our
communities they're not acceptable
we have to work on them i believe that
history will judge me and i will judge
myself
by what we do and so
you know i made my statement today very
very very clear
about what i think about this there are
these disparities in health they're the
disparities in education their
disparities
uh in housing and many many other things
and we have to change
we have to change that but what i think
i'll get judged by
is what i do what i do
uh and so you know it's up to the res
up to the general assembly these are not
in resolutions that the governor signs
uh there is their resolutions but what
we're going to be judged by is what we
do
and do we do something about racism
and do we speak out against racism
and whether this resolution is the best
way to do it or not
i'm going to leave that up to the
general assembly but i i made it very
very clear
you know what what i think about this
and
you know there are disparities out there
that are caused by racism there are
other disparities that are caused by
other things
we have to fix them all sometimes the
racism is
is overt
a person is racist sometimes someone is
doing something
they don't even realize it which is why
again
education and training and some of these
things are so very very important when
we're talking about our own
our own our own employees so i'm gonna
leave that up to the general assembly
i'm i'm the governor i i made my
statement about what i think is
important and i think we need to be
judged
and the legislature needs to be judged
what do we do in this area
you know at the end of the year what
what have we done uh and there's some
very very tangible things that that we
i know i can do in the executive branch
and we will do and we'll continue to do
more
uh and there's things that the the
general assembly can do as well
uh we look forward to seeing you all on
tuesday uh we will talk in in more
detail about sports and talk about other
other things i hope everybody has a good
weekend
thank you very much
you
