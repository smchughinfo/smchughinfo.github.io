    "nonetheless",
    "according to the allegations he had that",
    "gun anyway",
    "and used it against this child",
    "our legislation pending today in the",
    "general assembly",
    "will go a long way to deal with this",
    "problem",
    "and the problem is repeat violent",
    "offenders",
    "who have a gun our legislation",
    "would give our judges would give our",
    "prosecutors",
    "our police a lot more ability to deal",

    "of our communities",
    "cincinnati police shared some of their",
    "data with us regarding gun crimes",

    "months in just three of their districts",
    "nearly two dozen people who are",
    "forbidden from carrying a gun because of",

    "prohibited from possessing a gun",
    "as i've been saying for months ohio's",
    "law and illegal gun",
    "possession aren't tough enough right now",
    "when someone who is prohibited from",
    "having a gun is found with a gun",
    "is often not considered a serious felony",
    "offense",
    "so they frequently receive probation",
    "instead of jail time",
    "and they go right back to the streets",
    "under our bill it would become a",
    "second-degree felony",
    "which is a more serious offense with a",
    "presumption of a prison",
    "sentence the bottom line is this",
    "those who illegally possess guns are",
    "oftentimes the ones",
    "who use them again ohio's failure to",
    "properly address",
    "felons who carry guns and use them to",
    "commit crimes",
    "allows these individuals to wreak havoc",
    "throughout our communities",
    "and stay in those communities if we",
    "truly",
    "truly want to address the issue of gun",
    "violence in this state",
    "we must deal with a small number of",
    "criminals who are willing to illegally",
    "use a gun to inflict harm",
    "on others our legislation",
    "would give judges better ability to",
    "sentence these",
    "offenders to prison and get them off the",
    "streets",
    "this is a bill and this particular",
    "provision in the bill is something",
    "that chiefs of police have been talking",
    "about for a long long time",
    "and notice i said it's a relatively",
    "small number of people",
    "i think if you talk to your chief if you",
    "live in a city",
    "if you talk to your chief or talk to a",
    "police officer they will tell you",
    "that the majority of the violent crime",
    "is committed by a relatively small",
    "number of the criminal element",
    "and in a large majority of these cases",
    "these are people who have already",
    "committed felons",
    "they've been told they're not allowed to",
    "have a gun they can't have a gun",
    "and yet they go ahead and commit the",
    "offense so having the ability",
    "to find that person in possession of a",
    "gun",
    "before they commit an offense and get",
    "them off the streets and give the judge",
    "the discretion to sentence them for a",
    "significant period of time will save a",
    "lot of lives",
    "i want to take a few moments to talk",
    "about the sports",
    "order that we issued last week and",
    "particularly the variance because we put",
    "this",
    "in here for a very specific uh reason",
    "and i know some school districts i've",
    "talked to some of the superintendents on",
    "the phone they've had some questions",
    "about this so let me kind of go go",
    "through this",
    "and just remember our our goal is to",
    "have the athletes playing the young",
    "people",
    "playing the sport and have the ability",
    "of their parents",
    "family members to attend and actually",
    "watch them",
    "so the goal is no spectators other than",
    "family members either family members of",
    "the",
    "the ball team or if it's a football team",
    "and there's a there's a",
    "marching band at halftime we want the",
    "parents to be able to come and see their",
    "children play in the band as as",
    "as well so that's really the the goal uh",
    "we limited the maximum number of",
    "spectators gathered to the lesser of",
    "1500",
    "individuals or 15 percent of fixed",
    "permanent",
    "seated capacity for outdoor sports",
    "events so that's for outdoor sports",
    "events for indoor",
    "it's the lesser of 300 individuals or 15",
    "percent",
    "of the fixed seated permanent capacity",
    "for indoor sports",
    "venues the primary purpose of permitting",
    "spectators",
    "at school sports event is to allow",
    "officials and family and",
    "household members and loved ones of the",
    "players of the coaches",
    "team staff members other event",
    "participants including marching band",
    "honor",
    "honor guard for both home and away",
    "teams to attend and share in the",
    "experience",
    "ideally the spectator limit would enable",
    "at least two and maybe four",
    "family members to attend the sporting",
    "event provided that the venue is large",
    "enough to allow at least a six",
    "foot of social distancing between",
    "individuals who are seated",
    "we know that the fixed seating capacity",
    "of some",
    "sports venues particularly our smaller",
    "schools",
    "that might not allow this to happen and",
    "that's why we have",
    "a variance procedure",
    "so the one of the reasons why the sports",
    "order contains a variance",
    "uh provision allowing schools is to",
    "allow schools to submit a plan",
    "to their local health department so you",
    "need to go",
    "first to your local health department",
    "and then also to the state of ohio but",
    "the health department the local health",
    "department will take the first action",
    "and then we will follow up in regard to",
    "that",
    "so the order requires that the variance",
    "plan include they can have a little map",
    "in there if you want to",
    "but a justification as to why the",
    "circumstance of the venue",
    "justified different capacity requirement",
    "and",
    "second how the submitted plan will",
    "adequately achieve similar results as",
    "the requirements and guidance in the",
    "order",
    "in particular it is essential that the",
    "variance plan demonstrate",
    "that its proposed increased spectator",
    "limit",
    "will still enable at least six feet of",
    "social distancing between",
    "family groups it is the responsibility",
    "of the school the venue",
    "to home team to monitor and enforce the",
    "social distancing requirement",
    "as well as the prohibition on",
    "congregating among spectators",
    "and the other provisions that are",
    "outlined in the sports order",
    "evaluating a sports venue's variance",
    "plan may require conversations with",
    "school",
    "officials venue officials and perhaps a",
    "site visit",
    "which is why the ohio department of",
    "health will rely upon the local health",
    "department to first conduct",
    "their assessment of the variance plan",
    "here's kind of my summary when schools",
    "ask for a variance they should ask",
    "themselves",
    "these questions is the variance",
    "necessary",
    "to allow home and away",
    "family members to be able to attend",
    "two can the number of requested",
    "spectators that you're asking",
    "uh to go to can they be socially",
    "distanced is it physically possible",
    "three can the home school adequately",
    "prevent the requested",
    "number of spectators from actually",
    "congregating i talked to a school",
    "superintendent this week",
    "uh who who told me yeah we could hold",
    "this number",
    "but and we could keep them distanced but",
    "we can't we really can't control the",
    "crowd",
    "and so you know you have to kind of work",
    "through that",
    "i would further add though the variance",
    "was not designed",
    "for a big stadium just to be able to",
    "fill fans in there much as we would love",
    "to have all fans back",
    "we've got to keep our eye on the ball we",
    "got to start off slow",
    "and so the goal is to have spectators",
    "but the only spectators really be",
    "family members of those who are",
    "participating in the event",
    "uh or in the case of band members uh",
    "those who are playing it maybe playing",
    "at halftime or have some other",
    "uh role in in that the game itself or",
    "the halftime events if it's football or",
    "whatever whatever the sport might be",
    "that you might have another group it",
    "could include",
    "family members or cheerleaders for for",
    "example",
    "let's talk for a moment about the census",
    "again we want to remind you about the",
    "census very important",
    "it takes about 10 minutes to fill this",
    "out",
    "and really our representation in",
    "congress will be determined",
    "by the number of ohioans who are counted",
    "a different assistance that comes in",
    "federal funds",
    "many many things are determined by what",
    "the account is",
    "uh our goals have an accurate account",
    "which we need",
    "which means we need you we need you to",
    "fill out your your census form and so",
    "we'll ask you to do that",
    "we have kind of a treat today uh the",
    "people who are really on the front line",
    "in regard the coronavirus are",
    "are health commissioners uh they're the",
    "ones who are out there",
    "i talk to them and listen to them mostly",
    "uh every monday morning",
    "early morning call and i learned some",
    "very much from them",
    "this is really a partnership that we",
    "have with them 113 separate health",
    "departments around the state of ohio",
    "first i'd like to introduce you to",
    "charles patterson",
    "of the clark county combined health",
    "district",
    "charlie has been clark county health",
    "commissioner for the past 20 years",
    "he has more than 31 years of public",
    "health experience",
    "at the state and the local level",
    "so charlie thank you very very much for",
    "for joining us",
    "thank you governor dewine let me just",
    "maybe",
    "look a little bit at at clark county and",
    "maybe if you could just kind of tell us",
    "uh how this has evolved maybe going back",
    "to at least when we",
    "we started the the color color code and",
    "kind of tell us what the evolution has",
    "been and maybe",
    "where you are today well we we started",
    "uh with the orange color code after",
    "about two weeks we moved up",
    "we had a few weeks of red",
    "back to orange and then last week due to",
    "our current circumstances",
    "we're back at the red hazard level we",
    "started",
    "basically with businesses and employers",
    "especially those essential employees",
    "that had to go to work every day",
    "as the schools were closed and many",
    "other businesses were",
    "these folks weren't allowed to stay home",
    "and so",
    "they they passed that along and several",
    "large outbreaks including a dole",
    "we had some outbreaks uh in",
    "manufacturing and warehousing in madison",
    "county that affected our community as",
    "well",
    "at this point uh we're seeing it in the",
    "general population",
    "and unfortunately that now is starting",
    "to affect our nursing homes",
    "and the the one way we're knowing that",
    "it's affecting the nursing homes is",
    "because",
    "the national guard testing that's going",
    "on uh it's a phenomenal program",
    "we're seeing the employees tested every",
    "two weeks uh",
    "unfortunately with that testing we are",
    "starting to find the indicators of",
    "employees and and now residents at our",
    "long-term care facilities being affected",
    "so in your case you were actually seeing",
    "kind of community spread then move into",
    "the nursing home",
    "is that kind of the absolutely",
    "we had the the we were seeing 55 cases a",
    "week or so",
    "uh and now that's moved into the nursing",
    "home long-term care",
    "that's bumped us up to more like 75 to",
    "80 cases a week now",
    "with those residents and employees being",
    "affected",
    "and um talk talk to us a little bit",
    "uh commissioner about the start of",
    "school",
    "uh clark county you have kind of",
    "some schools are remote i think and some",
    "are in person maybe some are hybrid",
    "how do you how do you handle that or",
    "what do you what do you see",
    "going forward because i know that you",
    "know the partnership between you",
    "and the superintendents you and the",
    "schools is a is a very very important",
    "partnership as schools start back",
    "up well we have we do have a great",
    "partnership with our superintendents",
    "but as you know local control is very",
    "important in ohio",
    "and local school boards have have chosen",
    "the the entire gamut here in clark",
    "county we have",
    "a couple of districts that are fully",
    "remote",
    "we have a couple of districts that are",
    "doing the hybrid",
    "and a couple that are going back to",
    "school full-time",
    "each of those districts has a plan in",
    "place to try to keep those students and",
    "teachers in school as long as possible",
    "and we'll be very closely monitoring",
    "that here in clark county",
    "to make sure we can keep those schools",
    "open one of the things that we have to",
    "be very careful though is",
    "personal responsibility of all of our",
    "citizens because just as we've seen it",
    "affect our",
    "long-term cares we know that if people",
    "are not following your guidance",
    "with the social distancing and the",
    "masking we very quickly could see",
    "this transmission in the schools and",
    "then we'll have to work closely with the",
    "superintendents that are",
    "in person to see if we can continue that",
    "how we doing in clark county in regard",
    "to",
    "social distancing and wearing mask out",
    "in public i",
    "you have any anecdotal uh",
    "what you have seen maybe what your",
    "health department's seen well we've",
    "certainly seen",
    "a lot more masks on individuals",
    "since your mandatory mask order but i",
    "would tell you that the number of",
    "complaints we're getting",
    "has also written risen because of that",
    "people want to go to a store they want",
    "to go to a a place of business",
    "and feel safe and they only feel safe if",
    "everybody's wearing masks so we still",
    "have enough people",
    "not following the guidance that that's",
    "throwing our numbers off and that's why",
    "we continue to battle this in the in",
    "in our community uh maybe a last",
    "question if we could go back to the",
    "schools",
    "for for a moment um",
    "just as the nursing homes many times",
    "will reflect",
    "um you know the community spread",
    "certainly schools are going to",
    "and and do those they're open now uh",
    "reflect the community",
    "spread um what's",
    "what's the procedure what what's the",
    "procedure school follows",
    "if let's say that you know they have",
    "some",
    "indication they have a student who has",
    "some of the symptoms well the first",
    "thing that will happen is the contact",
    "tracers at the health department will",
    "work with the school districts we have",
    "designated people at each of the school",
    "districts that will be sharing",
    "information with",
    "the school nurses are very vital to this",
    "effort moving forward",
    "and we'll look at seating charts we'll",
    "see",
    "exactly who has spent that less than 15",
    "minutes",
    "or more than 15 minutes less than six",
    "feet away and those individuals",
    "who surround a positive case will be",
    "quarantined",
    "the positive cases will be isolated and",
    "we won't look at entire class if we can",
    "we'll leave as many kids in place as we",
    "can",
    "but those individuals who are affected",
    "we are going to have to make sure we",
    "stop the spread by that quarantine order",
    "well commissioner thank you very much",
    "not just for being here today but thank",
    "you for what uh you do to keep clark",
    "county the citizens of clark county safe",
    "and uh we we want to thank not only you",
    "but your whole team you've got a great",
    "team there and uh",
    "we we just appreciate we know you guys",
    "are working really really hard and this",
    "is uh there's no let up in this so",
    "so thank you for what you do thanks for",
    "acknowledging the team",
    "governor they they're doing yeoman's job",
    "out there they are indeed thank you",
    "thanks a lot commissioner let's go up",
    "north",
    "to medina i'd like to turn to krista",
    "wazowski health commissioner at the",
    "medina county health",
    "department she's been a health",
    "commissioner for 15 years",
    "passed eight of those in medina county",
    "before that she was not too far away in",
    "marrell county",
    "she has 28 years of public health",
    "service",
    "medina was read for three weeks",
    "july 23rd and the 30th and august",
    "6th uh commissioner you want to kind of",
    "first of all thanks for for joining with",
    "us and can you kind of maybe",
    "give us as charlie did can you kind of",
    "give us the uh",
    "rundown of what uh where you are in",
    "medina county now and kind of where",
    "you've been how you got there",
    "sir thank you governor uh so medina",
    "county",
    "you know since mid early june actually",
    "we've",
    "only had 17 covic cases coming out of",
    "congregate settings",
    "we too have had the ohio national guard",
    "in here doing",
    "testing a lot of testing happening",
    "within congregate settings",
    "but the cases that we're seeing in",
    "medina county are really coming from",
    "community spread",
    "so to give you an idea back in back in",
    "may we were seeing",
    "14 cases a week on average and then in",
    "july we were seeing 74 cases a week on",
    "average",
    "and now in august we're seeing 85 cases",
    "a week on average",
    "so while medina county has never been",
    "designated as a high incidence county",
    "even",
    "even the weeks when we were red we do",
    "have some communities",
    "in our county that are having more",
    "significant spread",
    "so some of the challenges that we're",
    "having",
    "are people giving complete contact lists",
    "to us",
    "i think sometimes when people have a",
    "mild illness they don't really want to",
    "inconvenience their friends",
    "but really contact notification and that",
    "tracing process",
    "and working with working with public",
    "health is really the only way",
    "that we're going to get in front of this",
    "virus",
    "you know we want people really to",
    "remember that the virus",
    "it may be mild for you but it might not",
    "be mild for that next person",
    "really to commissioner patterson's point",
    "you know those cases that ended up in",
    "the community and then finding its way",
    "into his nursing home",
    "they've actually had some rather tragic",
    "outcomes from that in his county",
    "you talked about different parts of the",
    "county",
    "where do you see it most uh the northern",
    "the northern part of medina county are",
    "our border that's closest",
    "you know we're a suburb of both akron",
    "and of cleveland so",
    "it's our northern end of our county",
    "where we're seeing more of our cases and",
    "communities spread",
    "and talk to me a little bit if you can",
    "about the opening of schools and",
    "kind of what your relationship has been",
    "with the the different school districts",
    "worked very closely with all of our",
    "superintendents i had a call with them",
    "just prior to this call so",
    "as in clark and many of our other",
    "counties people have different plans",
    "the beauty of local control is that",
    "those local plans are in place a lot of",
    "safety protocols",
    "but really our ability to keep our",
    "schools open and to keep",
    "our students playing sports and doing",
    "extracurriculars",
    "really rely on us being able to contain",
    "this virus",
    "and talk to me a little bit about",
    "um",
    "how you how you're seeing this occur you",
    "talked about community spread",
    "um maybe anecdotally what",
    "if you trace these back and i understand",
    "we can't always trace them back",
    "sometimes",
    "it's out in the community and you just",
    "can't really figure out but are you",
    "seeing",
    "when you do trace it back what what are",
    "you seeing",
    "yeah sure we're seeing what we're seeing",
    "is a lot of",
    "unintentional exposures you know some of",
    "our young adults in particular",
    "are having mild symptoms it seems like a",
    "cold to them",
    "and so they think it's okay to maybe go",
    "to sporting events or to work",
    "or to other social gatherings and then",
    "once their tests are coming back",
    "sometimes they're surprised that they",
    "have covid and that they've infected",
    "other people",
    "and so what we're really we really need",
    "across the state we need",
    "with our schools opening really for",
    "parents",
    "to be willing to kind of step in and",
    "keep kids home and keep their friends",
    "away",
    "while we try to why we try to contain",
    "the virus so",
    "i i know everybody is anxious to get",
    "back and we are all anxious to get back",
    "and to see one another and",
    "it's exciting to have school back in",
    "session but those safety protocols that",
    "we put into place",
    "at sporting events and in school those",
    "need to carry over",
    "into the other interactions that our",
    "kids are having outside of the school",
    "if we want to keep our schools healthy",
    "maybe walk",
    "through a kind of a hypothetical case",
    "let's let's say it's a it's a young",
    "person",
    "and they have symptoms or let's just",
    "maybe it's an older person they have",
    "symptoms",
    "what what do you what should they be",
    "doing they they go in",
    "and let's say they're let's say they",
    "take a test let's get them that far they",
    "take a test",
    "and they're waiting so what what's the",
    "protocol what are they supposed to be",
    "doing then",
    "yeah so what what we really need to see",
    "happen is",
    "if there's that level of suspicion",
    "either on the part of the person to seek",
    "out testing or to have a doctor",
    "prescribe that and to have that occur",
    "is really for for that person to assume",
    "that their test is positive",
    "and to really isolate themselves away",
    "from other people",
    "and if possible ideally away from other",
    "people even within their household",
    "um to contain that and to not have other",
    "people also become",
    "positive um you know a lot of times",
    "people",
    "um want to want to believe that they're",
    "not sick and it's not",
    "covid and um and that's really where",
    "we're seeing other people becoming ill",
    "because because folks are kind of living",
    "their normal life",
    "and doing what they what they would",
    "normally do while they're waiting for",
    "that result to come back",
    "so we really need people um if you",
    "are waiting for your test results to",
    "come back truly",
    "staying at home and staying away from",
    "other people is um",
    "is you being a really good a good friend",
    "a good neighbor",
    "and and really a good co-worker and your",
    "time counts",
    "uh right during that period of time",
    "right it does",
    "if you're symptomatic the time that",
    "you're spending at home in isolation",
    "that counts towards your total isolation",
    "period that public health will ask you",
    "to stay away from people so",
    "um you're just sort of getting a jump",
    "start on that and you're also",
    "keeping that list of contacts very small",
    "if you're if you're staying home and",
    "away from other people",
    "so we're part of the way in this we're",
    "not quite sure how far",
    "um but you've been battling this for",
    "some time you and",
    "your team",
    "[Music]",
    "tell me the future in medina what do you",
    "what do you worry about",
    "uh what are you optimistic about just",
    "kind of",
    "you don't have a crystal ball i don't",
    "have a crystal ball but kind of what",
    "how do you see things in medina yeah",
    "yeah so",
    "i'm very optimistic we have the mascot",
    "medina campaign",
    "we're seeing we're seeing more mass",
    "being worn to the point that",
    "commissioner patterson made people are",
    "expecting to see",
    "masks when they go into places as a",
    "safety measure",
    "so i'm very optimistic about that um",
    "some of the things that concern me are",
    "um",
    "are that spread that we're gonna that",
    "we're seeing",
    "within within our younger within our",
    "younger",
    "citizens we really we really need to get",
    "ahead of this",
    "and we need to get ahead of this before",
    "flu season starts that's for sure",
    "in in getting ahead of it means what to",
    "you",
    "to me it means um keeping it",
    "keeping one person who's ill keeping",
    "that",
    "number that they that they also get ill",
    "very very small",
    "so back in the beginning our list we",
    "only had",
    "maybe a one contact and very few",
    "very few a little bit of disease spread",
    "but as we",
    "come up now we're having 10 15",
    "many contacts and so that just",
    "exponentially potentially spreads that",
    "disease so",
    "when i say get in front of it i mean all",
    "of us being very responsible",
    "it's really to one another and if we're",
    "feeling ill staying away",
    "and containing that illness well",
    "commissioner thank you very much and",
    "also thanks to all your team",

    "to a lot of different people so i think",
    "that's going to be our challenge this",
    "year",
    "and so you know i'm going to rely on",
    "what uh the secretary of state",
    "he's all over this uh but if we see a",
    "problem uh",
    "we're open to any kind of you know",

    "on 11.7 million people almost i guess",
    "we can get them out there and be bold",
    "workers uh we're really encouraging high",
    "school students because we're their",
    "provisions that allow high school",

    "uh worldwide this type of activity but",
    "you know the tracing",
    "uh you know relies really on our local",
    "health departments",
    "they're the ones who are doing most of",
    "the hiring we have come in and hired",
    "tracers so that we can if a county is",

    "basically a",
    "consistent state plan in other words",
    "the way these are reported to the public",
    "should be",
    "whether it's in belmont county or huron",
    "county",
    "or hamilton county it should be the same",
    "way",
    "so we will have a procedure",
    "to outline for you on thursday",
    "so your question anticipated something",
    "that we're working on because frankly i",
    "felt it needs to be consistent",
    "we need to protect because the law says",
    "we",
    "should and because the right thing",
    "individual and",
    "into individuals health information",
    "but uh you know knowing that something",
    "is going on",
    "uh is is important and so i it's also",
    "important not only that it be reported",
    "to you know it needs to be reported the",
    "health department",
    "obviously but it needs to be also in",
    "real time reported to parents",
    "so that parents have an idea of what's",
    "going on and that needs to be",
    "also reported to the news media so we'll",

    "college students returning to campus",
    "there have been some major outbreaks at",
    "other colleges in other states in",
    "alabama and north carolina",
    "have you seen any evidence of similar",
    "situations may be happening here",
    "and if so how do you prevent that how do",
    "you deal with that when it comes up",
    "well i was on a call this morning that i",
    "put together",
    "to talk with our university presidents",
    "of our state",
    "four-year institutions we went through",
    "that we talked",
    "a lot about that i mean we have seen you",
    "have seen just in the news media",
    "uh you know you saw miami announcement",
    "this morning or last night",
    "uh saw some news youngstown state um",
    "i talked to both both presidents about",
    "about that uh",
    "they both have it you know under under",
    "control but",
    "look i think the lessons that we see in",
    "colleges",
    "quite candidly are similar to the",
    "lessons that we are seeing",
    "uh among the population that's not going",
    "to college",
    "usually older and that is that",
    "the spread is occurring because people",
    "are letting their guard down",
    "the spread is occurring because people",
    "are getting together",
    "and because they're with friends they're",
    "in a social situation",
    "sometimes they're drinking they let",
    "their guard down they don't wear a mask",
    "they don't keep a social distance",
    "if you look at the outbreaks on college",
    "campuses a lot of them have come",
    "directly from that type of a party or",
    "that",
    "type of an event",
    "i've told the college presidents i told",
    "them yesterday morning i said look i i",
    "think that",
    "you certainly are in a good position and",
    "you will",
    "protect these your students you have a",
    "plan you'll protect your students when",
    "they're in class",
    "uh you'll protect them in the library uh",
    "you'll protect them",
    "uh probably pretty well in in the dorms",
    "uh but what i worry about is what they",
    "do the other",
    "times and just human nature being human",
    "nature and what it is",
    "uh so one of the university presidents i",
    "i talked to this this week one of our",
    "private schools",
    "i think summarized it pretty well he",
    "said really it's going to be up to the",
    "students",
    "if the students want to stay on campus",
    "if they want to",
    "continue to be able all of them to be in",
    "class",
    "or or to be on campus with some either a",
    "mixed",
    "hybrid process or or entirely back in",
    "class",
    "they're going to have to control it and",
    "they're",
    "they're going to have to have the",
    "internal the discipline",
    "and they're going to have to frankly",
    "have a little peer pressure on other",
    "students",
    "who maybe are doing things that are not",
    "very productive to",
    "to stay and staying in class so am i",
    "worried yes i'm worried",
    "i think we have every right to be",
    "worried as we",
    "k through 12 goes back many places in",
    "person",
    "many places where we have uh significant",
    "community spread",
    "uh at the same time our campuses are",
    "filling back up with students and",
    "you know to state the obvious even when",
    "campuses are remote for a while",
    "we're still seeing students go back",
    "physically to the campus",
    "particularly those who are living off",
    "campus",
    "they're just moving back and you you can",
    "be",
    "remote you can be online but they're",
    "still back in in",
    "congregating and in whatever community",
    "that is",
    "so these are all challenges that we face",
    "but i think the good news is",
    "i'm confident that every state",
    "university i'm confident",
    "you know the private schools all have a",
    "plan they're all on it",
    "they're doing the best that they can but",
    "it's ultimately going to come down to",
    "frankly what the students do",
    "and you know what kind of year that",
    "they're going to be able to have",
    "next question is from max philby at the",
    "columbus dispatch",
    "hi governor um we've heard from some",
    "long-term care facilities nursing homes",
    "assisted living centers",
    "that are struggling financially and just",
    "having trouble resource wise",
    "with addressing the pandemic i'm curious",
    "is there anything more that the state",
    "can do to step in and help with that and",
    "if so what might that be",
    "well i mean we've been we've been paying",
    "uh as you know for a great deal of the",
    "testing",
    "we understand that they're under certain",
    "stress",
    "you know we've been helpful in regard to",
    "those who",
    "you know have medicaid patients so these",
    "are things we we",
    "will constantly monitor uh and",
    "constantly you know continue to talk",
    "with them um you know it's it's",
    "important that",
    "every whether it's an assisted living uh",
    "whether it is a nursing home",
    "uh you know obviously that they have the",
    "the ability to keep going and they have",
    "the ability to employ people",
    "and they follow the best sanitation",
    "practices",
    "and that the testing be occurring so",
    "we're helping them with the testing",
    "we're trying to help them in regard to",
    "the",
    "sanitation but we're certainly open to",
    "look at other things that we",
    "might might be able to do",
    "next question is from kevin landers at",
    "wbns in columbus well governor thanks",
    "for taking mike",
    "my question uh two-parter for you first",
    "of all are you taking calls for your",
    "impeachment seriously and secondly",
    "it's been several weeks since the order",
    "was in place to",
    "curtail alcohol sales at bars do you",
    "think",
    "that is going to last through the end of",
    "the year is there any data",
    "that you've seen that shows that's",
    "working thank you",
    "sure well let me talk about",
    "the first question you ask my focus",
    "as governor is going to continue to be",
    "and my priority",
    "priorities are to keep people safe and",
    "to get our economy",
    "moving faster getting people more people",
    "to work",
    "growing our economy and saving lives so",
    "that's where my focus",
    "is um if there are others",
    "in the legislature uh who want to spend",
    "their time",
    "on uh the the you know drawing up",
    "resolutions and filing articles uh",
    "you know look it's it's it's a free",
    "country that's how they want to spend",
    "their time",
    "you know i would just say to them have",
    "at it",
    "but my focus uh is to do what i'm sworn",
    "to do and that is to protect the people",
    "of the state of ohio",
    "to get this economy moving faster to",
    "save lives",
    "that's what i'm going to do uh second",
    "question",
    "in regard to the bars um you know kevin",
    "it's it's a work in progress i mean",
    "we're going to continue to evaluate this",
    "you know unfortunately you know",
    "fortunately most bars are doing a good",
    "job",
    "as you can tell by the citations that",
    "are issued we have some that are not",
    "following the law",
    "so this is something that we're going to",
    "continue to look at no decision has been",
    "made",
    "next question is from andrew welsh",
    "huggins at the associated press",
    "hi governor",
    "kevin's question so the the impeachment",
    "proposal announced monday was obviously",
    "a tiny effort just for lawmakers",
    "but um you know several other of your",
    "fellow republicans have",
    "expressed concerns about your approach",
    "to the coronavirus and",
    "what they've called a heavy-handed",
    "response and they've sponsored a number",
    "of bills to restrict your and the health",
    "director's powers",
    "so i guess my question is what concerns",
    "do you have",
    "not about the impeachment but about your",
    "legislative support regarding the",
    "pandemic as",
    "you know time goes on and the health",
    "orders stay in place",
    "well we don't want any health order to",
    "stay on a day",
    "an hour or a second longer than it needs",
    "to be on",
    "um we're going to get through this and",
    "my goal is to",
    "for as many ohioans as possible all of",
    "us if possible",
    "to get through this because we'll get",
    "through this",
    "there will be a vaccine there will be",
    "things that",
    "are there to get us moving uh so we're",
    "gonna get through it",
    "but we gotta we gotta get through it um",
    "look i i am there's nobody more open",
    "than i am",
    "uh every legislator has my cell phone",
    "uh as we found out when one of the",
    "legislators posted that on the internet",
    "uh so everybody's got got my phone",
    "number now",
    "but look i have great deal of respect",
    "for the for the four leaders",
    "i communicate with them they communicate",
    "with me",
    "it's a two-way street as far as",
    "information but ultimately",
    "this is a 102 year",
    "pandemic and this is not an ordinary",
    "time and so we're going to have to do",
    "what we need to do to protect ohioans",
    "i think the good news is that",
    "basically everything is open the",
    "restrictions you mentioned there's one",
    "mention the last question you know 10",
    "p.m",
    "cut off of liquor you know we've got a",
    "requirement that people out in public",
    "wear a mask",
    "but really what we're looking at is",
    "sacrifices um that",
    "compared to the gravity of what we're",
    "dealing with are relative relatively",
    "small sacrifices",
    "you know the biggest sacrifices i think",
    "most people are making is",
    "self-imposed sacrifices not seeing their",
    "grandkids or keeping a distance when",
    "they do see their grandkids and look",
    "these are just tough things",
    "but they're not imposed by by me they're",
    "they're basically",
    "you know self-defined and you know we",
    "tell people",
    "keep a social distance uh we do all",
    "those things because that's the best",
    "health instruction that there can be uh",
    "but we're gonna get through this",
    "and uh you know we're gonna get through",
    "it and ohio is going to",
    "move forward and ohio families are going",
    "to move forward",
    "so i'm going to look i i do not shy away",
    "from making decisions um",
    "somebody has to make those decisions",
    "when you're dealing with a 100-year",
    "pandemic and i i make the decisions",
    "some people agree some people disagree",
    "but the thing i can assure you is that",
    "each decision is made",
    "with the best advice i can get from the",
    "health community",
    "uh and it's made with uh my dedication",
    "and my commitment to the to the people",
    "of the state of ohio and",
    "keep them keep them safe and to keep our",
    "economy moving",
    "governor uh i wanted to add some",
    "uh information to the answer on the",
    "nursing home",
    "question so far there have been",
    "205 million dollars that are",
    "appropriated to",
    "long-term care facilities 180 million",
    "to help them through coronavirus relief",
    "funds another 25 million for",
    "infection control uh and then",
    "additionally there are",
    "approximately 400 million dollars in",
    "provider relief across all",
    "spectrum in addition uh to to the",
    "to behavioral health rural hospitals and",
    "et cetera so",
    "uh that that money uh has gone out much",
    "of it's gone out to",
    "long-term care facilities some of it's",
    "still in process waiting on the",
    "documentation",
    "but uh to the to the earlier question",
    "where uh we understand this challenge",
    "that they've",
    "that they all face and when we're trying",
    "to get the relief dollars out to them as",
    "fast as we can",
    "thank you",
    "next question is from adrian robbins at",
    "wcmh in columbus",
    "hi governor thank you for doing this",
    "again um is there any update that you",
    "could give when",
    "ohioans could see the additional 300 for",
    "unemployment and",
    "ultimately when it does come do you",
    "think that's going to be enough money",
    "for these people",
    "who continue to struggle during the",
    "pandemic",
    "well look i know people are are",
    "suffering",
    "we made the application the application",
    "is in",
    "um and you know i talked to the",
    "labor secretary actually yesterday about",
    "about that",
    "my team tells me that assuming things",
    "are approved",
    "in a timely manner we make the switch",
    "over",
    "mechanical switch over and things that",
    "need to be done that we're talking about",
    "the first checks going out in",
    "mid-september",
    "to late september and those would be",
    "retroactive so",
    "you know the first check would be up",
    "until that",
    "that point in time i've made it clear in",
    "my team we need to get this out just as",
    "absolutely quickly as we can",
    "people are hurting people need it",
    "next question is from scott hallis of",
    "the xenia daily gazette",
    "hey hey governor thank you for scott",
    "again um",
    "i've gotten a couple emails and a couple",
    "calls from some restaurant",
    "and um bar owners here in greene county",
    "um who have paid extra with their liquor",
    "license to",
    "be able to be open until 2 30. from what",
    "they tell me it's you know several",
    "thousand dollars extra with their liquor",
    "license",
    "you know they understand having to be",
    "closed at first",
    "now they're reopened and they can't you",
    "know sell alcohol past 10. they were",
    "wondering",
    "you know because they're all struggling",
    "financially would they be able to get a",
    "break",
    "you know they use the term refund on",
    "their liquor license what they paid from",
    "you know the normal one 1 a.m to the 2",
    "30. would they be able to get a break",
    "next year i'm sure there's other",
    "you know owners around the state that",
    "may have that same question",
    "yeah we can certainly look at that i",
    "think that's a valid point",
    "um you know we gave them uh some break",
    "uh when we everybody every every bar",
    "um when they started back up after",
    "they've been closed in regard to the",
    "first i think it's",
    "500 of the liquor but i know this is a",
    "different issue",
    "and so we'll look at that good question",
    "we'll look at it next question is from",
    "jeff radick at wsyx in columbus",
    "afternoon governor you were talking",
    "earlier about this variance plan for",
    "schools and of course we've all been in",
    "these",
    "shoe box gymnasiums especially for youth",
    "sports",
    "uh and you said that a variants must",
    "still",
    "ensure six feet of social distancing how",
    "can you ensure that all family members",
    "will be able to",
    "see these events",
    "i think it can be done outside i think",
    "inside",
    "you know i i grew up in a in a high",
    "school had a very very small gym",
    "i've seen a lot of small gyms uh so you",
    "know yes those are",
    "those are difficult uh what we're simply",
    "asking schools to do is to prioritize",
    "families um and they're gonna have to do",
    "you know they're gonna have to do the",
    "best",
    "the best that they can um we're trying",
    "to get a balance here",
    "um you know we want our young people to",
    "play",
    "sports for all the reasons that we know",
    "sports are important",
    "we want families to be able to be there",
    "to support them",
    "but we also want to minimize the spread",
    "when you're talking about inside it just",
    "becomes a much more difficult situation",
    "we have learned over this coronavirus",
    "five months or whatever",
    "period of time that um you know inside",
    "is just so much more dangerous than",
    "than outside so the numbers are smaller",
    "uh in inside",
    "um but the social distancing is",
    "is still very very very important so",
    "it's a balance",
    "uh you know each school is going to have",
    "to kind of take the",
    "priorities which have been set uh and i",
    "think it's priorities frankly that we we",
    "heard",
    "from families kids want to play",
    "we want to see them if we can and and so",
    "we're trying to take those priorities as",
    "established by ohio families",
    "and work them through the biggest school",
    "with the biggest gym to the smallest one",
    "in the smallest",
    "the smallest gym it's not always easy",
    "but i'm i'm sure that schools will do",
    "the best that they can",
    "next question is from alex ebert at",
    "bloomberg",
    "good afternoon governor we're doing",
    "coverage of governors that are",
    "issuing executive orders or",

    "uh in regard to the flu frankly what i'm",
    "hoping",

    "where we can we can take the tracing",
    "and turn that into statistics we can",
    "take the tracing and turn it into",

    "yeah look i think that you know you make",
    "an interesting point",
    "um uh you know we're constantly",
    "evaluating and trying to re-evaluate",
    "and and one thing i want to assure the",
    "people of ohio",
    "is that you know we're trying to do this",
    "from a",
    "scientific point of view a medical point",
    "of view",
    "and talking to the best experts about",
    "how we slow how we slow the spread",
    "so when we talk about these venues for",
    "example",
    "uh the theaters um look",
    "we know that the numbers that we have",
    "set um",
    "you know for a commercial production",
    "uh is probably not going to work for",
    "them",
    "uh they pretty much have said that but",
    "we also know",
    "that it could work maybe for",
    "a high school theater company",
    "uh or the you know the the senior play",
    "uh or",
    "theater uh you know we've seen so many",
    "kids get so much out of theater",
    "you know under these guidelines they can",
    "probably figure out some way of doing",
    "that",
    "um understanding that there are risks uh",
    "you're inside",
    "and and you're projecting uh as a good",
    "theater major would do uh so you know",
    "you have to kind of compensate",
    "so uh one one step at a time and uh",
    "we're just gonna but we'll continue to",
    "evaluate",
    "all the other things that that we are",
    "out there doing",
    "and the other limits that we that we",
    "have set",
    "thank you governor",
    "next question is from marty schleyden at",
    "the ohio capitol journal",
    "afternoon governor marty um",
    "this is the general observation it seems",
    "as if during these uh",
    "conferences we spent a lot more time",
    "talking about youth sports",
    "uh entertainment sort of middle class",
    "concerns than we do",
    "um what's going on in poor and minority",
    "communities which are most vulnerable to",
    "the virus",
    "and i'm being told by some people who i",
    "don't think are being alarmist that",
    "things could get bad enough that it",
    "could contribute to civil",
    "unrest among these people as they don't",
    "have jobs and become economically",
    "desperate",
    "do you think your administration is",
    "focused enough on that",
    "and more broadly do you think society as",
    "a whole is",
    "well i think we understand we understand",
    "it i mean you've got",
    "marty you've got two different things",
    "and i think you're talking about two",
    "different things they're certainly",
    "related",
    "uh one we continue to see um",
    "a difference in the covid um",
    "its impact on african americans its",
    "impact on hispanic",
    "uh in fact we had a chart that i had in",
    "my briefing this morning that i thought",
    "about bringing in we just didn't bring",
    "it in but we could bring it in",
    "which shows that the disparity that we",
    "see among adults",
    "has certainly been carried forward in",
    "regard to to",
    "young people so we're seeing",
    "african-american children",
    "who have a higher have these higher",
    "rates higher numbers",
    "and again that should not surprise us",
    "you know so in regard to that",
    "you know we put a lot of effort uh in",
    "the national guard",
    "going into areas that are underserved",
    "we can i continue to focus on our team",
    "and when we look at",
    "the guard now has been pulled is pulled",
    "out of the nursing homes and we've got",
    "testing going on now that the nursing",
    "homes themselves will be doing",
    "uh we were two weeks now we're trying",
    "you know two weeks",
    "and now you know as we look to the",
    "future we're trying to get that down to",
    "one week",
    "but the guard now has more ability to go",
    "into other communities",
    "and so again if anyone is watching any",
    "of our legislators",
    "who have ideas about areas that we need",
    "to go",
    "congregate living settings maybe",
    "apartment buildings",
    "other places to do testing uh we are",
    "very much",
    "uh uh willing to to do that",
    "and so again trying to get underserved",
    "areas",
    "uh in in regard to that uh is",
    "is very very important um you know",
    "look we have uh we we talked about this",
    "the other day we we have discrepancies",
    "not just in health",
    "uh we have other discrepancies uh the",
    "plan that we outlined",
    "you know we have other discrepancies not",
    "just in health we have it in health",
    "we have housing we have an education",
    "between african-americans hispanic",
    "and the white citizens of this state",
    "so you know we laid out a plan um",
    "but we're always open to to more ideas",
    "and more",
    "more things to look at so i don't know",
    "john whether you have anything you want",
    "to add",
    "to that you were going over some data",
    "with me today in regard to",
    "unemployment and other things but sure",
    "um",
    "look we're this is why we're",
    "applying for approval from the federal",
    "government for",
    "the 300 additional payment for people",
    "who are unemployed",
    "uh this is why you know we have some",
    "exciting things that we're working on",
    "we will announce soon with jobs ohio and",
    "our",
    "and our folks from the department of job",
    "and family services who are working on",
    "with local communities to uh target",
    "populations who are traditionally",
    "underserved",
    "uh and where there are high unemployment",
    "rates you see",
    "what we were talking about today is",
    "bringing",
    "the private sector and public resources",
    "together to educate",
    "non-traditional students in tech so",
    "you know we have tech cred which we talk",
    "about all the time which is upskilling",

    "different populations we're trying to",
    "serve everybody",
    "you know this has been our",
    "administration's goal all along",
    "when we started it was a four percent",
    "unemployment rate",
    "uh and businesses couldn't find enough",
    "people and we were doing everything",
    "under the sun to bring everybody into",
    "the game",
    "to get everybody off the bench we could",
    "and put and put them",
    "into a training program or job",
    "opportunities",
    "and we're very focused on that and we",
    "don't want to leave anybody behind",
    "whether you're at the",
    "low end of the economic scale and in",
    "terms of skills",
    "uh we want to upskill you we want to get",
    "you into a good job we want to",
    "start people moving up that economic",
    "ladder and",
    "and we're we're focused not just on the",
    "middle class and",
    "not just uh on the poor we're focused on",
    "everybody because that's what it takes",
    "to have a vibrant economy we need",
    "everybody in the game",
    "employers need talent we need to keep up",
    "skilling people",
    "that's why we wanted schools to get back",
    "into session so that we",
    "we wouldn't lose academic progress from",
    "our young people",
    "and so we're i think we're",
    "very focused on this topic every single",
    "day",
    "next question is from laura hancock at",

    "deploy that test and so we'll be talking",
    "more about that we're still working on",
    "it working with the other states",
    "so don't really have anything more to",

    "that",
    "um it's okay in the library they know",
    "how to do that",
    "they got a plan for the dorms uh but",
    "it's",
    "it's all the time that the you know the",
    "young person is on campus",
    "uh or in the in that community maybe not",
    "directly on campus but in that community",
    "and what they do the rest of time but",
    "that's no different frankly",
    "than what we see with with the rest of",
    "us um",
    "you know we all uh kind of let our guard",
    "down sometimes",
    "and uh uh you know the strongest message",
    "i believe",
    "uh that we can give to young people and",
    "it's not",
    "not for me but from from college",
    "presidents but it really is from their",
    "their",

    "distance uh these informal activities",
    "are going to have to you have to be very",
    "careful with them",
    "uh and you just can't let your guard",
    "down and that's really the that's really",
    "the",
    "the message that i hear um you know from",
    "from college presidents",
    "and uh you know as i talk as i talk to",
    "people who are on campus that's that's",
    "kind of the message",
    "students got to do it",
    "governor next question is the last",
    "question and it belongs to jim hoddy at",
    "whio in dayton",
    "governor thank you the question i want",
    "to go back to the articles of",
    "impeachment",
    "in terms of defending your approach here",
    "what would you tell the people who are",
    "behind this attempt",
    "not just those four lawmakers but the",
    "people have been following them",
    "uh in terms of defending your approach",
    "they say it is just not conservative",
    "enough you're still hurting businesses",
    "the mass mandate is an infringement upon",
    "their freedoms what would you tell them",
    "directly",
    "well i'm a conservative i think",
    "conservatives historically are to",
    "preserve life",
    "um to su to preserve liberty",
    "and the things that we've done",
    "and the things that we've talked about",
    "doing",
    "keeping the distance wearing a mask",
    "and the other things that we've done",
    "it's about preserving life",
    "look we're going to get through this",
    "we're going to get through this",
    "you know we don't need to lose any more",

    "who could come out the other side and",
    "have a great life ahead",
    "no matter what age they are we don't",
    "want to lose them",
    "so i i think that",
    "what we have done uh in consultation",
    "with health",
    "experts is in the tradition",
    "of conservatism uh it is the",
    "great tradition of freedom in this",
    "country and that is we have always as a",
    "people",
    "always i think it's one thing that makes",
    "us different than other countries",
    "or at least something we're very proud",
    "of is we're willing to make sacrifices",
    "now for long-term gain",
    "and the sacrifices we're talking about",
    "now yes they are sacrifices",
    "but the long-term gain is not just",

    "come roaring back through ohio",
    "it's smoldering it's there it's flaring",
    "up in some counties",
    "we have put that fire out but that's",
    "all about preserving",
    "protecting liberty freedom",
    "and basically our way of life and i",
    "think my actions",
    "this administration's actions that have",
    "been so informed by the best",
    "evidence that we could get all the way",
    "through uh we may not have been right on",
    "everything",
    "but they've been taken in the point of",
    "view",
    "of of that in preserving our liberty",
    "uh and so that's that's my answer to to",
    "the people who",
    "are critical and look uh there many",
    "people watching today",
    "who think you know i've not done a good",
    "job they have every right to think that",
    "uh we have a strong strong first",
    "amendment",
    "members of the state legislature who",
    "want to spend their time",
    "uh on instead of",
    "dealing with the violence that we have",
    "out there where we have",
    "some bills that we know will make a",
    "difference that will save lives",
    "uh instead of some of the police reforms",
    "that we've talked about and by the way",
    "these police reforms are being put",
    "together",
    "by representatives of police uh along",
    "with others",
    "these are the things we ought to be",
    "spending our time worrying about",
