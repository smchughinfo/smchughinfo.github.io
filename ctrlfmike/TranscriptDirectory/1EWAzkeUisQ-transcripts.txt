[Music]
that's impressive
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
afternoon everyone
in just a few minutes we will be
discussing our new numbers
uh for today as well as what our
color-coded map looks like this week
sadly our situation continues in ohio to
worsen
for my fellow ohioans who have felt that
until now this virus really did not
impact
their life did not impact
their family and who have said
i'll pay attention when it gets serious
i'll pay attention when it threatens me
and my family the message to them today
is
it is now serious and it's time
for all of us to come together
truly uh we need you we need each and
every one of you
we need you to be fully engaged in this
battle
when in a few minutes you see the data
when you see how fast the virus is
spreading across ohio
when you see that the virus has spread
and penetrated into virtually
every county extensively
in every county i think it will become
clear that we all must together
fight back we all must be
engaged
today's wall street journal former new
jersey governor chris christie has
written a very powerful
op-ed piece on his personal experience
with coven
governor christie in his characteristic
way
of speaking bluntly uh and straight
to the american people said that he'd
been wearing his mask for seven
months and then he didn't
he was diagnosed with coca-19 spent a
week in the icu
fighting the disease and he's with us
today
to tell his story and so governor thank
you very very much for
for joining us i i i
underlined one part of your op-ed i just
thought it was so
so strong um and i'll just read it
before i turn it over to you this is
your words talking about
wearing a mask keeping a distance these
minor inconveniences can save your life
your neighbors life and the economy
seldom has so little been asked for so
much benefit
governor you're looking good thank you
for joining us governor thank you
uh for having me uh with you this
morning and this afternoon rather and
and let me first just commend you for
the job that you're doing in ohio
um you have been a a consistent strong
voice right since the beginning
of this of this uh pandemic and i'm
happy to be uh to be a part of your your
presser today
um listen i i think the easiest way to
start this is to say
i thought i was safe and i was wrong
i got tested every day when i walked
into the grounds of the white house
for the four days that i was doing
debate prep with president trump
um i was assured sitting in the third
row of the amy coney barrett
ceremony which happened after our first
session of debate prep
that everyone in the first three rows
have been tested that day
and tested negative i was assured that
everybody in debate prep
had been tested and so
i took my mask off i walked
when i get to the gates of the white
house i had my mask on
when i walked through the gates and
found out that i had tested negative
at the white house medical unit i took
my mask off
and i left it off but only for the time
that i was inside those gates
as soon as i left to walk back to my
hotel i put my mask back
on immediately kept it on when i was in
the hotel
lobby walking down the streets and only
took it off once i got back in my room
by myself
i did that for four days out of seven
months
that we've been going through this
pandemic and
three days later i began to feel what i
call the freight train
of symptoms that happened with covet 19.
fever headaches incredible body aches
chills sweats um and
it overcame me in a period of 24 hours
to where i'd gone from feeling fine and
doing my work on a friday afternoon
to by saturday at one o'clock being
admitted to the hospital and taken
immediately to the intensive care unit
where i stayed for the next six and a
half days
and during that period of time i will
tell you
it is a frightening experience i want
everybody out there who's listening to
understand
that this is one of the most
unpredictable
random and brutal viruses
you'll ever see and every day my doctors
would come in
and tell me well things are looking a
little bit better or a little bit worse
but
we can't guarantee you that within an
hour it won't turn significantly worse
and with my history
as an asthmatic since i was 13 years old
they were very concerned
uh about how this would go for me so
my message to the people of ohio and to
the people of this country
which is why i did the op-ed is that
there's no place to hide
from this virus if you're not going to
take this common sense steps
that the cdc and the nih have
recommended to us
wear a mask when you're outside remain
socially distanced from people no big
crowds
and wash your hands frequently uh
you know i came out of this okay and i'm
very fortunate i still
feel some of the symptoms of fatigue
most particularly
and my doctors say it could last for
quite some time
but um i survived i'm alive and it very
well could have gone the other way
and for 220 000 other americans it has
so i just want to urge as many people as
i can don't let your guard down
it's not worth it i went through it i
made a huge mistake
by taking that mask off and it's
something that
i hope no other americans have to go
through
well thank you so much for not only
being
on our presser today but you know for
just speaking out for
writing the op-ed for sharing your
experience
you know as you told the story to me
before we went on the air now as you
tell it again
the psychological impact of a doctor
telling you that must have been just
terrifying when they come in every day
and say yeah you're
doing maybe okay or you know but this
thing could turn
like that i just i can't imagine that
you know
it wasn't the thing that adds to it is
you're in isolation
i was in the intensive care unit but in
isolation behind two inch thick glass
the glass was so thick that you couldn't
hear the nurses on the other side of the
glass
they would hold up a whiteboard either
giving me instructions or asking me
questions and i had a whiteboard to
write back to them
i when they came in they were in heavy
ppe
and so you you're just left alone with
your thoughts
and you know that's one of the things
that i think people don't
understand about this disease because
it's so random because
so much so little is understood that
you know when you're there and you're
going through it the psychological
effect that it has on you and it
certainly had on me
was significant you start to think about
you know
life and death and you're in the throes
of
at the same time the way i described it
to one of my friends was it's like
getting beaten up from the inside
out and that combination of physical and
psychological stress
is unique in my life and and pretty
extraordinary
so i again i can't emphasize enough i
know how tired everybody is of this
i know it i felt it myself and
but i will tell you that as tired as you
are of strapping that mask on
or going to the sink and washing those
hands again um
i can tell you you will take those days
in a heartbeat
compared to getting this disease
well been as you describe it being
basically in total isolation
during this time no family no ability to
you know have somebody love there with
you or hold your hand
or do anything it just must have been
you know it must be very
tough thank you governor thank you for
giving me the chance to talk to the
people of ohio today
and be a part of your team i support
what you're doing out there
i want to tell the people of ohio that
from my experience what the governor's
advising you to do
it's exactly the right thing to do and i
hope that you follow his
advice and direction um he he has
learned a great deal about this over the
last seven months
and he's been an incredibly articulate
spokesman for the people of ohio and for
what we need to do to battle his
pandemic so
uh you're all in my prayers uh and uh
governor thank you for giving me the
time
um to be with you today and to continue
to spread this message
well governor thank you for doing it
thank you for having the courage to
to describe what happened to you and
your
your experience and uh you know i think
that
getting that story out we'll never know
but
i'm sure it will save lives it will save
other people from some real agony
and their families from going going
through that as well
so you're you're looking great you're
feeling pretty good
a little tired but you look you look you
look good
thank you thank you well thank you
governor i sure hope it does save some
lives both in ohio and around the
country
and god bless you for what you're doing
thank you god bless you too
thank you very much thanks governor
today i'm wearing a purple tie in
recognition of
purple thursday october is domestic
violence awareness month
and americans all over the country are
wearing purple today to bring attention
to this very
important issue a particular
purple tie that i have on is spring hill
college
which is where our youngest daughter
anna went it was a
tie the purple tie i picked out today
if you need help in regard to domestic
violence
if you need help leaving and getting to
a safe place
uh please reach out to the ohio domestic
violence network
their number is 800-934
that's 800-934-9840 that's the ohio
domestic violence
network you can also visit odvn.org and
of course if you experience
an emergency you can call 911.
eric let's go to the data
well as you can see the numbers continue
to go up
today we're reporting 2425
new cases since yesterday this is the
highest number
we've ever reported on a single day
since this started in ohio
seven and a half months ago the highest
before that was yesterday of the 10
highest days of new cases reported eight
have occurred in the past
nine days uh nine have occurred in the
month of october alone
and quite candidly what is most scary
about this is
it does not seem like we're even
starting to get to a plateau
that just goes up and up we have
12 deaths reported since yesterday in
addition there were 159
new hospital admissions the third
highest we have reported so far and
25 new icu admissions
rick let's go to our hospitalization
slide and look at that for a moment
these are the current number of cova 19
patients that are
in the hospital this is what this chart
uh is it's really a hospital account
um this is one of the
really most important indicators that we
have
uh it's a lagging indicator it's late
late obviously
well after someone is diagnosed many
times
uh although chris christie's uh it was
not it was
you know apparently within the same day
this number has been trending higher for
the past several weeks
uh for example on october 9th
see if i can find uh
october 9th is back
here october 9th is the first
part of that october 9th we had a total
of
853 cova 19 patients in our hospitals in
ohio
today that number has grown to 1293
we certainly must prevent overwhelming
our hospital system to ensure that
ohioans can receive inpatient treatment
for coca-19 but also
we have to have room for other people
uh people who are there for serious
accidents car crashes
strokes and heart attacks that's why
this number is
certainly something that we we keep our
eye on
eric let's go to the public health
advisory system
numbers
there's really two things we ask you to
look at and if you're looking
for your school district if you're
looking at for your uh your community
really two big things to look at this is
the first one this is where your county
ranks in the last two weeks a number of
cases per 100 000 population
as you can see
the blue part continues in the blue part
the blue shaded counties
are high incident counties
when this started we had a handful of
counties
that were high incidents we've gone
through this at different points
today as you can see it's virtually
takes all the way over to here all of
these candles
or high incident counties uh again that
means there's over a hundred thousand
uh per hundred thousand uh cases
is how is how that is measured we'll get
into some numbers in a minute
uh we continue to have more and more
counties exceed the cdc's threshold for
high
incidents as we talk about our high
incidence
counties in the alert system we need to
remember
that the incident list shows you how
quickly the virus is transmitting in our
communities for example
let's go to the this this is the first
top of the list we'll go back eric to
previously we'll go this one putnam
county
you can see 186 cases
that they've had in the last two weeks
but they are at
five and a half times what the high
incidence rate is
according to the cdc five and a half
times that number
and you can see as we go down to all
glaze mercer jackson allen you can just
see
you know the high incidence is a hundred
and you can see these are
you know five and a half times three
times
some of them two times so very very
high um
let's go eric let's go look at the next
uh slide
this is our the other big indicator
which is our color slide and you can see
this is where we were last week
uh and this is where we are
uh this week and let's go to the next
slide eric we'll
show just that so this is where we are
this week today we have an alarming
number of counties that are red
38 of our counties are red
we also have three counties that are now
on the watch list which means that
they're between
red and purple that's clark county
cuyahoga county and hamilton county
this is an increase from 29 red counties
last week
and three as i said three on the watch
alert
[Music]
watch alert simply means that
all the indicators would indicate
they're purple this week but we
don't post them as purple until they've
done it for two weeks
straight so we don't know if they're
going to turn to purple or not we'll
have to see what happens
you know between now and next week and
then look at next week's numbers
the new red counties are alan crawford
giaga
harden lake lorraine ottawa tuscaroras
and wayne
five of these counties were read for the
first time crawford
jaga lake ottawa and tuscaroras
this is a we've continued to show this
and here we are this week this is the
percentage of our population that is is
red
um and then you see down here
some in in the orange and then very very
small cases now
few cases that are actually in in the
yellow
um this means the virus is spreading
throughout
all the regions of the state it's
penetrating everywhere
we now only have four counties that are
yellow
this is the highest number of red
counties the lowest number of yellow
counties to date
this means that 74 percent of ohioans
are living
in a red county 74
only one percent are living in a yellow
county
now let's go back and show the alert map
here again 92.8
almost 93 percent of ohioans are living
in a county that is red or
high incidence county i mentioned before
that every week that i have a call with
local health commissioners
and we did this this past monday
and every day members of my team are
reaching out to these health
commissioners as well
what we're hearing from these officials
from all over the state is
of course what we know that ohioans are
tired uh
they're laying their guard down they
want to see friends and and family
let me share a quick example of what we
learned about
from the local health department that
illustrates why
we just don't have the luxury of letting
our guard down
during the summers it got increasingly
hot a factory allowed its workers to
remove face coverings
on unfortunately uh the employers did
not start wearing masks again
when it cooled off this fall now there's
an outbreak of 25 employees
that crosses two counties with at least
two hospitalizations so far
these stories continue
throughout the state and again uh it is
when we let our guard down chris
christie's story is
is you know really speaks volumes about
what can happen you can be very very
careful you let your guard down for a
relatively short period of time and then
boom
um there there it is
i want to talk about our watch list
counties and the first one will be clark
county clark has a very high incidence
251 cases per hundred thousand
um what you're seeing in these watch
counties
uh is sustained increase in outpatient
visits for covert-like illness sustained
increase in hospitalizations
uh sustained increase in emergency
department visits so
several of these are very early
indicators
and they have to do with what's going on
in the hospitals clark county is on the
watch list for the first time since the
alert system started four months ago
the county also exceeds the cdc's
threshold for high incidents
local health department officials report
that there are 30 people hospitalized
for coven
they also report that they have a number
of cases from long-term care facilities
but the much of the spread in the
community is coming from people getting
together
with with friends just laying their
guard down
we're seeing transmission throughout
throughout the county
let's go to hamilton county hamilton
county is
about the same level of of cases
there at the rate of 234 cases per 100
000
residents they returned to the watch
list this week
the county exceeds the cdc's threshold
for high incidents
they're seeing growth in new cases and
growth in hospital admissions
local health department officials have
told us that they had
more new cases reported during the past
weekend
than any other weekend throughout the
pandemic
and they were reporting their highest
number of cases and hospitalizations
than they've had at any point
during the entire pandemic social
gatherings family get-togethers continue
to drive community spread
in hamilton county
let's go up north to cuyahoga county
cuyahoga county
is is a lower level they are just
right at the level about with their 101
cases per hundred thousand
but they're on the watch list because of
sustained increase in outpatient visits
sustained increase in hospitalizations
sustained increase in emergency
department visits
they returned to the watch list this
week in addition to exceeding the cdc's
threshold for high
incidence the county as i said is a
sustained increase in new cases
outpatient visits and hospital
admissions
local health department officials report
they're seeing double the case
volume compared to just two weeks ago
double the case volume
compared to just two weeks ago they also
report that hospitals are seeing
increased
inpatient and outpatient volume and that
social gatherings continue
to be a problem let's go quickly to the
new red
counties uh allen county joins the list
this week the county also exceeds the
cdc's threshold for high incidents
in fact they are quite high there are
345 cases per hundred thousand
the county has had sustained increase in
new cases also
sustained increase in outpatient visits
local health department officials report
that much of the spread in the community
is generating from
family get-togethers hospitals are also
starting to be
impacted they've added crawford county
crawford county also a very high
incidence they they also are red they
are at 296
cases per hundred thousand almost three
times the cdc's
high incident level crawford is read for
the first time the county exceeds the
cdc
threshold for high incidence and this is
seeing a sustained increase in new cases
cases and outpatient visits local health
department officials have told us
there's
more a third of their cases are coming
from spread between family members
there are small church outbreaks two
lawn care
care facility outbreaks but the majority
of virus transmissions they tell us is
coming from community spread
just all through the community wayne
county wayne county is also
a high level of cases 256 cases per
hundred thousand
they return to red this week they were
last read the week of september
3rd the county also exceeds the cdc's
threshold for high incidence and is
seeing a sustained increase in new cases
outpatient visits
and hospital admissions local health
department officials report there was a
significant outbreak at the college of
worcester
there have been some long-term care
facility outbreaks and the college of
worcester has
recently announced that they are going
remote
they have done a good job they've
prepared
but the spread has just overwhelmed them
in that sense so they are going uh
remote let's turn to tuscaroras county
they're red for the first time this week
they're at a fairly high rate 217 cases
per hundred thousand
over double the high incidence rate
they're seeing sustained increases in
new cases outpatient visits and hospital
admissions
the tuscaroras county local health
department reports they had a record
number of cases on monday
41 new cases on monday 22 residents are
hospitalized at least three are on
ventilators
spread continues in families and in the
community particularly through social
gatherings
ottawa county is read for the first time
this week the county exceeds the cdc's
threshold for high incidents
this is seeing a sustained increase in
new cases there at 130 cases
per hundred thousand health department
officials report the county has had more
than 90
cases to date in october which is triple
the number of cases they had in
september
like other areas of the state people are
socializing socializing with friends
family which is leading to additional
virus spread
hardin county there are 127 cases per
100 000
they returned to red this week the last
time the county was read
was the week of july 23rd
county exceeds cdc's threshold for high
incidence they're seeing an increase in
outpatient visits
the health department reports that
events continue to happen
and that they are having unfortunately
some difficulty
in getting people to cooperate in regard
to contact tracing which is really just
essential
if we're going to knock this down jogger
county they're not a high incidence
county they're at 86 per 100 000
but they are red for the first time this
week the county has seen sustained
increase in new cases
and outpatient visits social gatherings
have continued including get-togethers
with family friends there's been a
drop-off
in people wearing masks
and again while we haven't talked much
about this
when we're talking about people getting
together many times
the health departments will report that
people were not wearing masks
and that again i'll kind of go back to
what i've said
is that many times you can do things
but you just have to do it a little
different way and wearing the mask as
chris christie said
is just kind of a not a very big
sacrifice to prevent the spread of
virus to yourself or someone else lake
county
lake county is 68 cases per 100 000
not a high incidence the county has had
sustained increase in new cases
and outpatient visits they have traced
some of the virus spread
to large social gatherings uh that then
carried over into a workplace they've
encountered some resistance also with
contact tracing
let's go to lorraine county again their
their
incidence is 66 cases per 100 000 again
not over the
high incidence but they returned to red
this week
last time they were read was the week of
august 27th
county has had a sustained increase in
new cases cases and
outpatient visits local health
department officials report spread from
social gatherings including sleepovers
and some workplace transmission
so that's where we are let me turn to
another
uh topic nearly three years ago
as ohio's attorney general we became one
of the first states to file
a lawsuit against the drug companies and
against the distributors
this week the united states department
of justice announced a more than 8
billion
settlement with purdue pharma one of the
organizations that ohio sued
this is the beginning of justice
and there will be more outcomes of cases
as they move forward
so we congratulate the justice
department
and this is good this is good news for
the people of this country
let me now turn to lieutenant governor
john
thank you governor thank you very much
and uh
i just want to spend a little time on uh
the economic recovery and
and some news there and and really to
help
talk a little bit about how people who
maybe have been displaced by what's
occurred in the work in the workplace
since covid or due to technology
that there are a number of ways that you
can transition into a new career and one
of them i would like to focus on today
is apprenticeships
ohio is currently ranked number four in
the us for the number of apprenticeships
so we're
we're proud of that we think we've made
some some great progress in ohio on that
front
we have 19981 apprentices and on
average this is the important part the
apprentices in ohio earn as much as
uh 70 thousand dollars a year
or earn on average 70 000 a year we have
590 sponsors
of apprenticeships in the state of ohio
the great thing about an apprenticeship
is that
you can learn and earn at the same time
where
you're while you're in the process of
acquiring
your certification the only states that
are
currently rank ahead of us according to
the
registered apprenticeship partnership
information data system so
we've got some factual basis for this
we're california which is obviously a
bigger state
texas as well and south carolina and
we believe that frankly we can get to
number two in this one
and we're going to continue to push to
try to to add apprentices
also of note though we are number one
when you talk about state apprentices
alone state sponsored apprenticeships
versus federal sponsored apprenticeships
so we're doing this right in ohio
and if this at all sounds like of
interest to you
a family member someone you know
you know their apprentices in
construction manufacturing i.t
they're all over the place across the
board in the economy
we encourage you to go to
apprentice.ohio.gov
to apprentice.ohio.gov and there's more
information about how you can get
involved in that process in that system
i want to also spotlight a business
leader
business leadership we try to highlight
the businesses who've really stepped up
and as we know governor as we've often
discussed
that we have a lot of businesses who
stepped up and helped us we know that
ppe
is one of the areas that we are in
in definite need of particularly as the
virus resurges and
maybe as we have a a vaccine coming
sooner we're going to have even more and
more demand for ppe and i want to
highlight
one of those businesses norwalk
furniture
who after the the virus came about
they halted operations and then a local
because they they were there just wasn't
demand for their product at the time
and and a local hospital said hey could
you make ppe for us
and so they began manufacturing
thousands of hospital gowns and masks
at norwalk furniture uh and many of
their employees you know came back
uh and choose to come come back and help
and work overtime to help supply
the ppe and and uh this is
one example of the resiliency of ohio
businesses where they're stepping up
they're filling in a void and we know
that this is going to
be here for a while and we want these
businesses to continue to
to make ppe and we want ohioans to
continue to
we want america to purchase these things
domestically so we don't have to be
reliant on a international supply chain
for these
these particular
for ppe or anything else that's critical
during a pandemic i also want to add
on the on the jobs front that there are
currently one
159 315 jobs posted at ohio means jobs
you can go there and take a look 78 000
plus
more than 78 000 jobs pay 50 000
a year or more there are also
internships i like to highlight this
because i know people are struggling out
there
uh and and there are there are resources
to help you
there are opportunities out there and
we encourage you to take advantage of
them
and then governor in closing i know the
other day i talked about jackson county
how they were pulling together
as a community uh to
to coordinate their their efforts and
and on a little bit of a lighter side
uh but effective side particularly when
you hear governor christie's story it
was very compelling story
about the about wearing a mask and
following the rules well
in in dayton the dayton area chamber of
commerce has rallied the area mascots
so we have all of the mascots from the
from the local teams
uh heater and gem from the dayton
dragons
and rowdy raider from wright state and
rudy flyer from the university of dayton
they started a campaign in the dayton
area
to help highlight wearing of masks
to reach people of all ages
the hashtag is daytonmascots
uh and uh we really appreciate the
innovative creative ways that people are
owning these problems at the local level
because we we do we have to
we have to rally together in the
smallest groups as families
as communities as regions and certainly
as a state and a nation
and we appreciate everybody who's
pulling together to try to convey these
messages out there across the state of
ohio
back to you governor john thank you very
much
we'll go to questions governor first
question today it's from john london at
wlwt in cincinnati
john hi governor uh with hamilton county
now on the watch list
parents teachers and students are
wondering what's going to happen
if their county turns purple next week
you've said schools are not the spread
problem that they're taking the right
precautions
i can tell you in recent days we've seen
bars and restaurants
where you'd think the pandemic had never
happened packed shoulder to shoulder
without mass so school families are
asking
since they're doing what you've said to
do and certain night spots are not
why should they the schools be punished
at all if the county goes purple why
wouldn't they be able to stay open
while health departments go after the
violence
great question and let me let me try to
try to answer that first of all
there's no
mandate from the state uh in regard to
purple uh there's some guidance
and we tell people it's a it's a
heightened level of awareness a
heightened level of concern um
but we always tell people to look at two
things
look at your color but also look at
number of cases per hundred thousand and
we
you can see it every week uh and that'll
give you some idea how
you compare to other other
counties for example cuyahoga county the
other end of the state john
um you know their numbers they're way
down the list
um you know they're i think they're
barely high incident level
that's high but there's 70 other
counties that have more spread than they
than they do so look at
where you are number of cases per 100
000 in the last two weeks that really
kind of tells you
what your odds are of running into
somebody who's got it
and that's kind of how the way i would i
would look at look at that so that's
important
the color code is
seven different potential indicators
kind of come together to tell you
overall where you are
and some of those indicators are early
warning
indicators and some of them are late
indicators for example
uh hospital more more people coming in
in into that hospital
the three counties that we put on the
watch list
all would qualify this week as purple
but our system says you gotta
be purple two weeks before we show you
as purple
so they're on our watch list they're not
they're not purple now let me
that what i just said is all information
that i think any ohio citizen
can get their hands on can look at
whether you're a parent where you're a
school administrator
you know just an average citizen you
just want to see what's going on in your
county
those are the two things we ask you to
look at
let's talk about our schools i expressed
the other day
a concern and a couple concerns
one what is reflected in schools
as far as covets spread
depends on what's going on in the
community if you've got
four times the covid spread for example
you're in a rural county it's got that
you're almost bound to have some spread
in your school
the schools john as you indicated around
this state
uh i i believe from all the information
i can get are doing a very good job
the indicators are that we are not
seeing
a significant amount of spread in the
schools themselves
and it goes back to what i've said that
what we've learned
what we've learned is when people are in
a a more formal setting
factory workplace
school people follow protocols
and they wear masks they try to keep a
distance
as much as possible and we don't see a
lot of spread generally
so that would be true with the schools
as it will be for
for in in in business same way with
colleges in classroom
we don't have an indication there's much
spread in the classroom
spreading spreading the dorms where the
school can control the situation
you know there's some but we're really
seeing it
spread throughout society it's just
people letting their guard down the
examples i gave
earlier today and just this social
interaction and spread people not
wearing mass not being careful
not keeping a distance so i i would ask
our
educators i would ask our
superintendents
take all that into consideration you
know in the same way
with with parents i think you also have
to add
the fact that while
some students will thrive no matter
how they're taught it would seem there
are many students who don't
uh and there are students who don't
thrive
in a remote learning situation
and so we are now seeing schools
that some schools that were you know
well remote of course
in in the in the spring uh they've come
back
and were remote up until now some of
them are announcing that they're going
to stay remote
at least until the end of this calendar
year
and i would just say look we believe in
local control
we believe in schools and parents making
these decisions
but i'm bothered as the governor frankly
by schools like my kids
being out of school that long and this
is again an individual decision but i
think that
everybody needs to we continue to learn
more
uh we're going to do a a study
but the results of that study will be
it'll take a month but we're going to go
into some schools uh with the school's
consent
and the and you know individuals consent
obviously families
uh and if let's say mary is in a
classroom and
she found out later she has coveted
and it's they look back and say well she
had
billy over here and he was within four
feet of her you know for longer than 15
minutes
and he's got to be quarantined and
that's what the cdc says
what we're going to do for schools that
if we can do this trial
and we intend to do this trial with new
new quick tests
we're going to take allow that student
who is close to the other student
to stay in school but to test them and
test them very frequently
at the same time we're going to take a
another group of people
in that school another group of students
in that school and again with
parents consent everyone's consent and
test them
even though they've not been exposed and
we're going to see what kind of numbers
that we
what we see because anecdotally
which is all we have now uh you know we
are just not seeing a lot of spread
directly in the classroom now when you
go up on the
on the uh
portal that we have put up uh where you
can look
and see how many schools reporting cases
um you know in some of those cases you
have to drill down and look at every
case but in some of those
they may be school related but they may
not have occurred in school
they may have been students getting
together uh it may have been
you know parents having an alternative
uh event
and uh you know so it didn't it didn't
occur in the school but it
impacts the kids in this school so these
are all things that i think
you know particularly parents
and school officials where kids have
been out of school for some period of
time
i i think they all need to take all
these factors into consideration
uh in deciding you know what what they
need to do
going forward and i i apologize for a
long answer but it's a
it's a complex issue it's
we've left it to the local community to
make this decision
part of my job i think is to give the
local community as much information as i
can
and some of the new information that
we're getting is we just kind of look at
this
anecdotally from schools is that
schools like most other things in
society that are more formal
there's not as much spread as there is
when people are just kind of getting
together
very informally so thanks for asking the
question john
next question is from danny eldridge at
hannah news service
hello governor how are you good um
so so with hospitalizations going up i'm
starting to hear that
beds are already becoming an issue with
hospitals running at full capacity
um at what point could we go back to
restricting
elective surgeries and other items and
what's the strategy for making sure
hospitals don't go bankrupt if that is
the case
yeah well we don't want to go bankrupt
and we also don't want them to stop
doing uh elective surgeries
uh you know we had the period of time
where they couldn't do it
when we made that initial decision in
the spring that was based upon advice
from hospitals
the decision about when hospitals stop
doing uh if they ever do stop doing
elective surgeries is going to be
informed by what hospitals are telling
us
and we're going to probably do this more
on a case-by-case basis but we'll have
to
we'll have to take a look at that again
i'm going to use every opportunity i can
to reinforce this message
we don't have to go there we do not have
to be there
we do not have to be in that situation
we can control this
if we get 90 85 percent of people were
in mass keeping the distance
uh and using their good common sense uh
about the spread
and we can avoid this we can turn this
around
um it's it's multiplying very quickly
but it will continue to do that unless
we do something differently
and doing something differently is just
more of us wearing masks and more of us
being careful
we've done it we've done it twice before
we can do it again governor
if i could if i could add on that
remember also that was also due to a
lack of ppe
and we have worked very hard to build a
supply chain for ppe
that was one of the original reasons
that they asked for us to
to delay uh uh electives and we've we've
built that out uh very well over time so
that helps
uh mitigate that problem and and we have
we have some
ohio companies we're very proud of this
some ohio companies making some of this
ppe now
so thank you
next question is from jeff redick at
wsyx in columbus
good afternoon governor this is the last
time that we'll get to talk to you
before the buckeyes return to play
the university is advising fans against
large gatherings
at home and i wonder if you'd address
that
as well um also this is against the
backdrop that
four of the eight teams the buckeyes are
scheduled to play
will come from or the buckeyes will go
to their states
where test rates are higher or much
higher than ohio
so it would seem there's an interesting
example to set here
well i think ohio state is absolutely
right
the president has a good message how
state athletics has a good message
uh and that is the risk is not going to
be
um you know obviously in the stands
they're going to limit it to number of
people they're going to be mostly
families uh that will be there
i think it's a total of 1500 ohio state
stadium
so um we're not concerned about those
fans
uh they can certainly spread out they
can wear masks we'll wear masks
[Music]
but it is the gathering of all what we
do as we watch the buckeyes
um and you know how we how we gather
together
and my message simply would be you know
please be careful
um you know you can watch the buckeyes
but you don't have to watch them with
you know a large number of people and uh
you know if you feel do you feel the
necessity of
watching them with a group of people
wear a mask you can wear a mask inside
uh you know keep some distance be
careful
be careful about the food but you know
these are all things that people can
can certainly do and be very very very
careful
as far as teams coming from high
incident states
we have a high incidence we're a high
incident state
we may not be as high positivity um
you know our positivity yesterday when i
looked at was six percent
for the day so it's gone from two and a
half to six
um not good um but as far as the
you know the states where it's very very
high um
you know some people might ask what's
the propriety of you know having these
football players come in
and and the reality is that they're
tested quite often
ohio state players are tested quite
often
uh you know they're following the best
protocols that they can
think they can find so
you know that's that's what they're
doing they've been very responsible
um all the way through in regard to how
they deal with it doesn't mean they
might not have us
have a spread but again the thing we
always we worry about more
uh it's not the formal settings it's the
informal settings
and that's that's what we should should
worry about
thank you next question is from joe
ingles at ohio public radio and
television
hey joe good afternoon governor um i
have a question about
thanksgiving going back to this this
question about
people coming in and and coming in from
all over
um there's a the airlines some of the
airlines are providing testing
different states have different testing
guidelines you just referred to it in
the
case with the football um but the thing
is that governor christie when he was
speaking he said that
testing kind of made him a little bit uh
overly sure of his situation do you
think that
that people can look at all this testing
that's going on
and and get a false sense of security
and what's being done
to make sure that that doesn't happen
yes i think people uh can get a false
sense of security they get
they get a negative test and they think
they're okay well
it you know
frequent testing is good um but
it doesn't mean you change your behavior
and i think that was the message from
uh governor christie you know wear a
mask
or mask don't stop wearing a mask don't
take that mask off just because
you have tested negative today next
person you may run into may have it
and you don't know it and they may not
know so i think that's the strong strong
message
you know don't don't think that because
you've
you've taken a test and you you're
negative um
that you can let your guard down i mean
that's you know
one of things that we've learned this
virus is sneaky
nasty and it can
come up on you pretty quick and people
can have it and they don't know they
have it so the next person you run into
might
might have it so yeah continue to wear a
mask i think that's the strong
strong messages first thanksgiving get
back to what we've talked about with
halloween and thanksgiving before it may
not be the same thanksgiving you've had
in the past
uh you know where a bunch of people come
in from out of town and you mix a bunch
of families together it just doesn't
make any sense
and i think we got to look at this from
the long run long
long view of this and the good news is
that we'll we're going to get through
this
and we're going to break through vira
you know the
vaccine is coming but it's not here
and uh we don't have any kind of
immunity uh
and so we're exposed and we're gonna
we're gonna remain
exposed and so once you get outside the
people
that live with you you gotta be alert
has to go up even if they're loved ones
next question is from marty schlayton at
the ohio capitol journal
good afternoon governor good afternoon
um
so the numbers that you spoke of in the
antique
governor christie cave i think for most
rational people those would be pretty
sobering
um but if you looked on your twitter
feed right now it's
screaming with some pretty
you know false stuff like uh the the
spike proves
that mass don't work the increase in
cases is
due strictly to more testing um and i
just want to ask you
where do you think this hostility to
science comes from
and do you think it's harmed the state's
effort to combat the virus
well first of all this is not what you
ask but i'm going to use an occasion to
answer it anyway
or state it i'm not for any kind of
censorship
i'm bothered anytime there's any any
censorship out there
um uh you know anybody pulling stuff
down
from you know a company
pulling something down is not the right
thing to do
but uh look
what we can simply do is is is
share data share information um
you know i fully expected when
governor christie came and talked that
people would be on the internet right
away saying diff
different things i just found his story
to be a compelling story
when i read it when i first heard him on
tv then i
read the op-ed i just thought it was
compelling and i thought
i related to it because i think it's
something that anybody could do
uh you know anybody who thought okay i'm
saved my
heavens i'm at the white house they test
everybody every day or
every other day whatever it is they test
people often i'm safe
and he said when i walked in i put you
know took my mask off when i walked out
on the street and put my mask back
on and and so his story i just think is
a compelling
compelling story the whole idea that our
our uh
cases are going up solely because
increase in testing
is just nuts i mean it's you know it's
it's it's not right the biggest the way
you can tell that is you know
look at look at our increase in
positivity generally as you go out and
testing a
wider wider group of people you would
expect
and in testing many people who don't
have symptoms now
uh you would expect that the positivity
would go down
uh that is not what's happened uh as our
cases
you know uh yes our cases have gone up
in our positive but our positivity has
gone up as well
and it's you know almost double what
what's more than
double uh than what it was um
three weeks ago so you know look people
can
we're always gonna have people out there
who who just
make arguments that don't make any sense
and
are not based on science and
there's nothing we can do about that so
we just hope that
you know we believe in the first
amendment and and that people will sort
it out and i think in the end people do
sort it out i think that's what
is compelling about chris christie's
story you know people can say oh gee
you know i might have been in that same
position
next question is from bradley underwood
at wkrc in cincinnati
good afternoon governor um this wasn't
the question i had planned on asking but
based on what you've said today and some
of the other questions
uh when you say you know we can do this
we can stop this spread
um we gotta wear a mask we gotta stay
distant
down here in hamilton county obviously
that's not working people are not
listening
um and we're seeing that across the
country
on the verge of going purple here in
hamilton county um
are we going to expect shutdowns i mean
what what what are the next steps to do
because
clearly people are not taking the advice
to mask up
and stay distant
well there's still time there's still
time for them to do that
and i'm i'm the optimist i think people
will do it i mean i had look i
i think i told you this the other day i
had had somebody who called me and
basically said
you know uh you know in our community
people don't take it seriously until
they take it seriously and now they're
starting to take it seriously
um you know i would hope that as i
started the press conference with
that for those of my fellow ohioans who
have said
it doesn't impact me it's not in my
county or if it's in my county it's not
spread very much and i'm going to take
my chance
and when it gets serious i'll get
serious about it but until then don't
bother me
what i'm saying today is it's time to
pay attention
it is serious now it is getting worse by
the minute
and we see the data ever recorded every
single day and the numbers just
are going like this so it's time to get
serious
we can do this and
we have it not only can ohioans do it
ohioans are in the unique position
to do this you know government cannot
mandate unless we're in china or unless
some totalitarian state
and we don't want to live there and we
don't want to do that government
is not going to come knocking on your
door and making sure that
you know you're not having a party
government's not going to
can't be everywhere it's not going to
say you know hey where's your mask
ultimately there's personal
responsibility here
ohioans are pragmatic people
uh we're tough we're strong we're
pragmatic we get serious when it's time
to get serious it's time to get serious
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
max hey governor how are you doing today
i'm well sir uh with the election
just uh over two or just under two weeks
away
are do you have any concerns that we're
seeing cases spike right now and
should the secretary of state's office
or any boards of elections take any
other
precautions with cases surging right now
well secretary of state's on it franklin
rose is on this
he lives and breathes it every day
so i don't have any advice for him my
advice to any
of our fellow citizens who are concerned
about going and voting on election day
plenty of time now get your absentee
ballot and and go ahead and vote
uh you can certainly do that if you want
to do that if you're concerned about
that
you know if you want to check the board
of elections and see what kind of line
there is next tuesday at two o'clock or
something uh you know depending on
what how many people are showing up at
that time of day um
you know you might want to show up then
or find a time that is
a down time so there's there's many
opportunities for people to
to vote um again i think you know
we may have very high voting but we're
also going to have
a higher number of people voting early
than have ever voted before
i think in ohio history so that should
spread it out
on on election day the other thing i
just keep reminding
everyone please please please wear a
mask when you go in to vote
we owe it to the workers there we owe it
to the people who are there
and undoubtedly there will be some poll
workers who have
a medical problem so poll workers who
who
are older and they are you know very
very susceptible
um and if they get it susceptible to the
outcome not being
a great outcome so a charity
love for our poll workers who are
working a long day anyway and let's help
them out by wearing a mask
next question is from laura hancock at
cleveland.com
hi governor um as you know we're in this
spike
um schools and businesses and just
average ohioans
you know are trying to make difficult
decisions to spend stem the
spread of infection and keep themselves
safe um
yet we still don't have the contract a
contact tracing data
um that pinpoints the sources of the
spread
and we've only gotten anecdotes over the
past few months
when can we get some real data that
shows how this virus is spreading
well it's interesting that you mentioned
that
we had a meeting this morning
specifically about that
and you know what we have had
so far it was a
system that was designed not for the
pandemic
we've been trying to live with this
system uh because
local health departments have been
overwhelmed 113 local health departments
uh but we've we've made the decision
that we need to
you know get better data uh and so
what's happening now is you know they're
reporting things
uh but it's you know it's it's more
anecdotal
and so we're going to give them a field
of things to check um
of you know what comes up in an
interview
but i would even say to tell you that
even when we get that
it it's not going to be in most cases
many many many cases
it can't be determined particularly now
that we have
significant significant community spread
it cannot be determined where that
person
got it so what you may have is a list of
places this
person has been during that period of
time might be restaurant might be a bar
might be home might be family might be
this might be that
many times the person who's doing the
tracing cannot determine
you know exactly where that person got
it
so you'll have me you might have you
could conceivably even under
our new system you could conceivably
have five checks
seven checks different places you have
no clue
which of those places that person person
got it from
because you know it's not a case where
in every case they come back and say
you know like we've solved the problem
we know
you know that he got this at 10 o'clock
at such and such a place
that's just not the world we live in
it's not what we have so what we're
going to do
is try to make it easier for the local
health departments
to report it by checking different
options
but even when we get that information
you're not going to have any you know
you may have some better information but
it's not going to be
certainly not going to be definitive um
at all and so that's the challenge what
you have
now um is
you know notes that have been taken so
you can go through
you can you could go through and you
could do a word
search but for example
if the if the note taker had taken down
if you
if you search for bar and the note taker
or restaurant
and the note taker had written not in a
bar or not in a restaurant
that would still show up as a restaurant
or show up as a bar so
you know we're upping the system we hope
it doesn't cost
too much added time for our for the
caseworkers
people who are out there every day in
the 113 health departments
so we'll go ahead and do that but even
after we do it
the information we're going to get is is
still going to be somewhat
anecdotal
next question is from jackie borchardt
at the cincinnati enquirer
hey jackie hey good afternoon um
i'm going to go back to something you
said earlier you were talking about
concerns about kids being out of school
and not learning well in the virtual
environment
and the evidence we have so far is that
schools are not environments that lead
to a lot of spread
yet many school districts are using the
color-coded map
which includes cases that colleges and
universities and
um are not necessarily in those schools
to determine whether they're going to be
online or in person i guess how much
should schools be looking at that
color-coded map to make their decisions
and um like it like you said earlier it
is
at odds with run hearing out of some
school districts
how how should schools go about making
that decision of bringing the kids back
or
sending them home yeah look i i think if
i it was my child if i was a parent
uh if i was a superintendent if i was
school board
i tried to gather all the information i
could
i would look at the color code because
that tells you
you know overall what's going on in your
county
greene county where we are right now
went red
and you know people make decisions based
based upon that it tells you something
you also need to look at the list of
88 counties and number of cases they've
had in the last two weeks
i think you also i would look at if my
school was
in session or if my school was in
hybrid i would want to look at how many
cases i'm showing up in school
what show what what is what's going on
in my school itself
if you were in a big county uh if you're
in a franklin county or cuyahoga county
and i would drill down and look at my
zip codes
or zip code where my school is because
you know what what may be happening in
one part of the county it may not be
quite reflected the same in the other
although the spread now is just going
you know it's going everywhere
but i also would look at my students and
i would try to try to make a
determination if i was
going remote how are they doing uh how
do we
how do i think this is working out for
these students
if i was hybrid the days that were
remote these kids are remote if i was
totally remote i'd want to say well look
how we doing
everybody's trying but how how is this
getting
delivered or the kids getting it and i
would look
i would look at that so i think it's you
got there's no one
solution in every school district's
different
uh but i would want to look at all of
those things
and then make a determination and look
throughout this virus
everything is a balancing act everything
is you you're balancing
time after time we're looking at choices
and neither which
neither choice is great in fact some
choices are bad
both bad ones just worse than the other
one
and so you've got to figure out what's
the risk risk to the kids
risk to the teachers you've got to
figure out
you know how much how well are these
students doing or can they do remotely
uh how well can they do in in person
what's the weather and the weather being
the color-coded map and
and being the number of cases that that
we've got
so i think i would look at you know all
of those things
and that's why you know i appreciate
your question because i really wanted to
cover this today because i've been
talking last night to a school
superintendent from hamilton county i've
talked to others
and um there's no magic to this there's
no
[Music]
if this then we automatically do this
these are these are judgment calls
that are being made by good people under
very
very very difficult and adverse
conditions
next question is from jack windsor at
wmfd in mansfield
hey jack hi governor
hey thank you for answering my question
on tuesday about whether the state would
mandate vaccines or
require immunity certificates you said
that that you wouldn't
however the second part of my question
from tuesday was unanswered and i'd like
to get your answer on that today if i
may
will you allow others to mandate
vaccines for example
allowing businesses to require employees
to vaccinate in order to work
or maybe prospective customers and will
you allow schools to press for vaccines
for kids
despite ohio's existing exemptions for
kids k-12
since many boards uh school boards now
are currently not honoring
mass exemptions well
you know our law is clear in regard to
school kids
so you know i would see no uh
change in that law at all
uh in regard to school case uh we would
encourage people to get
the flu shot we encourage them to get
you know
all kinds of different shots uh but the
law is what the law is in regard to
to our school children that's one that's
one category
as far as your your other question about
whether a business could require
everyone that
would work work there to have to have a
shot
something i will talk talk to the
general assembly
we generally allow decisions like that
to be made in the workplace
if they directly impact the welfare of
the people
who are working there and we generally
allow those judgment calls to be made by
the employers uh who can set a a
condition of work but i want to talk to
the speaker i want to talk to senate
president i want to consult with other
members of the general assembly
to kind of get their feeling in regard
to that
thank you next question is from jess
hardin at mahoningmatters.com
hi governor thanks for taking my
question today
after you issued the statewide mass
mandate in july i spoke with
health officials in mahoning trumbull
and columbiana counties
and when they receive a complaint about
mass non-compliance
they typically send someone out to check
on how the business is enforcing the
mandate
there are essentially no repercussions
for consumers who choose not to wear
masks
the best each department can do is for
to ask that proper signage is in place
and to to enforce that
they've noted that the directive has
written is extremely difficult to
enforce and places a burden on already
burdened health departments
why not treat non-compliance with the
mass mandate like a parking ticket and
use
police or mask watchers or some force to
flag individual people in public who do
not wear masks um
this is being done all over the country
it's being in new york and connecticut
and charleston south carolina and a
bunch of cities in california
it's possible um but you know you've
been begging ohioans to wear a mask for
three months and it seems that we
you know see cases rise again and and
you have to make the same plea
why not hold ohioans a cannonball for a
mandate they're supposed to be following
if encouraging masking is your strategy
for responding to these concerning
numbers
well every time
the situation has got dire mohamed's
have stepped up
so i have to believe that they're going
to step up again this time when they
fully understand the data
and looking at this data as it evolves
uh and as we explain it every couple
days
every tuesday and thursday i think more
ohioans are going to wear a mask i'm
already getting
some calls from legislators say that
well we're we're in mass more in our
county or this
or this county uh as far as uh you know
issuing tickets
um quite candidly when we put this mass
order out we did not ask
of sheriffs or or police departments to
issue tickets but
many of them um uh you know made it very
clear
uh you know we're not in the mass
business we're not gonna do it
uh we're not gonna we're not gonna issue
issue those tickets so
um you know it's it's it's not
and as you say uh the health department
does not have the
the people uh to be everywhere
uh what i would say though is this that
if if and i think our businesses have
done a very
good job but if someone's working in a
business
where the mask order is not being
enforced we would like to hear about it
and we will take action again i think
businesses are doing a very very good
job but if you're you're you're a
employee
and you have to go work in a situation
where people are
ignoring the mass order and therefore
threatening your health
and safety you should not have to work
under those
under those conditions and i would also
say to our retail
uh outlets um
law is clear you know what our order is
clear is that you need to have your
employees wear a mask
i think to protect those mat those
employees
uh you know a consistent policy uh in
in your business about not serving
people
if they don't have a mask on uh now that
you know i understand no one wants to
turn away business
but again you've got an obligation to
protect your
your employees and that's they're the
ones who are on the front line
uh you know every single day
next question is from jim province at
the toledo blade
hi governor um on tuesday you told me
that
you believe that there had been some
cases of spread involving the recent
political rallies in western ohio
but you wanted to double check i wanted
to get back to you now and see what
what you learned from that yeah our team
told me uh
that day that they did not had not seen
uh from the local health departments any
indication
doesn't mean it didn't occur it's like
everything else you can have spread you
just don't know it
uh from a particular event so it could
have but
but i was wrong about that uh i was
incorrect about that
they at least as
of tuesday when i checked after the
press conference
they came back to me and told me that
they had not seen any examples
we will go back and check again from
local health departments and if local
health departments say they've got
spread well then they're the ones who
are on the front line
but we try to stay in touch with them
obviously to find out what's
you know what's going on so to my
knowledge we don't have any
that we know of next question is from
john reed at gangwar news service
good afternoon governor um with the
rise in hospital admissions and the
increased number of beds being used
how close are we to needing those
auxiliary
facilities like the convention centers
and things like that
and how ready are those to go if they
are needed
well i can tell you you know we we put
together with the ohio hospital
association
a system early on in march of this
this pandemic and so it's a good system
nothing like this i don't think it's
ever been done
in ohio before uh and it it zones as you
know it's
andy thomas dr thomas was on the other
day
and these three these zone leaders uh
three different zones they get together
all the time
uh and then they in turn are getting
together with all the hospitals
uh that they have in their zone so it's
a system of bigger hospitals smaller
hospitals
you know we're monitoring all kinds of
different things
so i have every confidence in the system
that's been set up
we had built out and plans for
build-out well-defined plans for
build-out
in the spring that did not have to be
implemented
we had some build out that was pulled
back so
there's room and there's room to grow
not what we want to see
but you know there is room to grow now
uh at the rate these cases are expanding
uh which is just it's skyrocketing
you know this can change and so where we
are in a week from now or two weeks from
now i can't tell you
but i can tell you what they're telling
me now
and that you know they don't like to see
the icu increase they don't like
certainly the hospital emission increase
and part of what you know we're looking
at is
the age and i'll go back to june and
july and june and july we were seeing a
younger group of people
getting it uh we think that you know
that younger group may have been
some of them at least may have infected
older people but we're seeing an older
group
now and that does not bode well uh for
what goes on inside the hospital
now you know medical care today is
everybody knows more uh you know your
odds are better
uh but we're still as you can see still
losing people every single day
who die of covet and it's still you know
it's still to some extent like you know
you're rolling the dice
uh and that's what chris christie
described is being in there and
you know you're in isolation they tell
you yeah you're doing a little better
whatever you're doing but you don't know
that this thing could turn
overnight and then you're in you've got
a ventilator or whatever they have to
they have to do so um
we're going to keep you informed uh the
hospitals will keep us informed we talk
with them all the time and
you know when we start seeing a crisis
in one area we're going to talk about it
but but we do know that when you have
this many cases expanding as fast as
they are and if they continue to expand
at this rate you're going to have more
people go to the hospital
and we know when we have more people go
to the hospital you're going to end up
with more people in icu
and that's not good next question is
from josh roltenberg at spectrum news
hi governor um you said that ohioans
still have time to turn this around
and you've also signaled to those that
haven't taken this seriously in the past
to now take it seriously
uh but how much time are you going to
give ohioans or at what point do you
consider a shutdown
if nearly three-fourths of the state is
living in danger of contracting the
virus
josh want to see um you know i'm i'm an
optimist as i told you i think ohioans
are going to react to this
and and i'm not just that's not just
wishful thinking ohioans have done it
twice before
there's no reason to think ohio's can't
step up again it won't step up again
if you look at the tools if you look at
the tools i have
and you look at the tools that all of us
collectively have as ohioans
the tools that ohioans collectively have
far exceed any kind of tool that i have
because no matter what order you issue
no matter what order you issue it
depends upon people's compliance with
the order
and so you know collectively we have the
power
we have the power to turn this thing
around
uh and we can do it and we need and we
need to do it
the tools that i have as governor
you know are not nearly as great as the
tools that people the state of ohio have
collectively
governor next question is the last
question for today and it belongs to jim
otty at whio in dayton jim governor on
that hi governor
on that last point talking about trying
to
get compliance here in the state of ohio
you can't compel compliance but for
those people who have been skeptical in
the past did remain so
what seems to be the problem here what's
wrong with this picture uh is it a
matter of
people just don't trust you or they
don't trust us
because we're reporting on what you have
to say do we need those skeptics to be
able to complete the circle to make sure
that this is all taken care of and we
can
stop this spread well
jim this is a little a little a little
joke but
you know maybe they're not watching our
press conference and maybe they're not
watching you at six o'clock on channel
seven i you know i don't know
i mean people are getting their
information from a lot of different
places today
and um you know i
i i understand that but i think
in all seriousness part of it is people
just tired
they're sick of it you know we're used
to going fighting a battle and getting
it over with and winning and
being done with it whether that's a
medical battle or any other kind of
battle
this is just different this is a long
struggle
this is a long struggle that tests us as
ohio ones
but it's a struggle we will win and
when we win it we want to have as many
ohioans there
to celebrate as we can
we have a common common enemy and it's
not
masked versus those who believe in mass
those who don't
we're not enemies we're on the same team
and so
i i think you know highlands can pull
together
uh i think we need to pull together this
is something that we can do together
it's in our best interest each one of us
to do this
it's the best interests of our families
and so we can do this
and i think we will do this we can we
can fight
fight back i want to close with a
new commercial that we're putting up uh
it kind of speaks for itself
but it's apt that just worked out this
way that today we're unveiling it today
we're putting it up
so people will be have a chance to see
it but it really describes i think
exactly what is happening in ohio
today
all it takes to start a chain reaction
is to let up
you stop keeping a safe distance take a
break from your mask
and suddenly an outbreak and another
and another affecting the people in your
circle
and people you've never met so remember
don't let up
the battle against government isn't over
stay safe
ohio
don't let up stay safe we'll see you all
on tuesday thank you very much
