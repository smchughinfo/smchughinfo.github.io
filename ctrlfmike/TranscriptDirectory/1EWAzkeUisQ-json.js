    "admitted to the hospital and taken",
    "immediately to the intensive care unit",
    "where i stayed for the next six and a",
    "half days",

    "that this is one of the most",
    "unpredictable",
    "random and brutal viruses",
    "you'll ever see and every day my doctors",

    "little bit better or a little bit worse",
    "but",
    "we can't guarantee you that within an",
    "hour it won't turn significantly worse",
    "and with my history",
    "as an asthmatic since i was 13 years old",
    "they were very concerned",
    "uh about how this would go for me so",
    "my message to the people of ohio and to",
    "the people of this country",
    "which is why i did the op-ed is that",
    "there's no place to hide",
    "from this virus if you're not going to",
    "take this common sense steps",
    "that the cdc and the nih have",
    "recommended to us",
    "wear a mask when you're outside remain",
    "socially distanced from people no big",
    "crowds",
    "and wash your hands frequently uh",
    "you know i came out of this okay and i'm",
    "very fortunate i still",
    "feel some of the symptoms of fatigue",
    "most particularly",
    "and my doctors say it could last for",
    "quite some time",
    "but um i survived i'm alive and it very",
    "well could have gone the other way",
    "and for 220 000 other americans it has",
    "so i just want to urge as many people as",
    "i can don't let your guard down",
    "it's not worth it i went through it i",
    "made a huge mistake",
    "by taking that mask off and it's",
    "something that",
    "i hope no other americans have to go",
    "through",
    "well thank you so much for not only",
    "being",
    "on our presser today but you know for",
    "just speaking out for",
    "writing the op-ed for sharing your",
    "experience",
    "you know as you told the story to me",
    "before we went on the air now as you",
    "tell it again",
    "the psychological impact of a doctor",
    "telling you that must have been just",
    "terrifying when they come in every day",
    "and say yeah you're",
    "doing maybe okay or you know but this",
    "thing could turn",
    "like that i just i can't imagine that",
    "you know",
    "it wasn't the thing that adds to it is",
    "you're in isolation",
    "i was in the intensive care unit but in",
    "isolation behind two inch thick glass",
    "the glass was so thick that you couldn't",
    "hear the nurses on the other side of the",
    "glass",
    "they would hold up a whiteboard either",
    "giving me instructions or asking me",
    "questions and i had a whiteboard to",
    "write back to them",
    "i when they came in they were in heavy",
    "ppe",
    "and so you you're just left alone with",
    "your thoughts",
    "and you know that's one of the things",
    "that i think people don't",
    "understand about this disease because",
    "it's so random because",
    "so much so little is understood that",
    "you know when you're there and you're",
    "going through it the psychological",
    "effect that it has on you and it",
    "certainly had on me",
    "was significant you start to think about",
    "you know",
    "life and death and you're in the throes",
    "of",
    "at the same time the way i described it",
    "to one of my friends was it's like",
    "getting beaten up from the inside",
    "out and that combination of physical and",
    "psychological stress",
    "is unique in my life and and pretty",
    "extraordinary",
    "so i again i can't emphasize enough i",
    "know how tired everybody is of this",
    "i know it i felt it myself and",
    "but i will tell you that as tired as you",
    "are of strapping that mask on",
    "or going to the sink and washing those",
    "hands again um",
    "i can tell you you will take those days",
    "in a heartbeat",
    "compared to getting this disease",
    "well been as you describe it being",
    "basically in total isolation",
    "during this time no family no ability to",
    "you know have somebody love there with",
    "you or hold your hand",
    "or do anything it just must have been",
    "you know it must be very",
    "tough thank you governor thank you for",
    "giving me the chance to talk to the",
    "people of ohio today",
    "and be a part of your team i support",
    "what you're doing out there",
    "i want to tell the people of ohio that",
    "from my experience what the governor's",
    "advising you to do",
    "it's exactly the right thing to do and i",
    "hope that you follow his",
    "advice and direction um he he has",
    "learned a great deal about this over the",
    "last seven months",
    "and he's been an incredibly articulate",
    "spokesman for the people of ohio and for",
    "what we need to do to battle his",
    "pandemic so",

    "really most important indicators that we",
    "have",
    "uh it's a lagging indicator it's late",
    "late obviously",
    "well after someone is diagnosed many",
    "times",
    "uh although chris christie's uh it was",
    "not it was",
    "you know apparently within the same day",
    "this number has been trending higher for",
    "the past several weeks",
    "uh for example on october 9th",

    "853 cova 19 patients in our hospitals in",
    "ohio",
    "today that number has grown to 1293",
    "we certainly must prevent overwhelming",
    "our hospital system to ensure that",
    "ohioans can receive inpatient treatment",
    "for coca-19 but also",
    "we have to have room for other people",
    "uh people who are there for serious",
    "accidents car crashes",
    "strokes and heart attacks that's why",

    "numbers",
    "there's really two things we ask you to",

    "really two big things to look at this is",
    "the first one this is where your county",
    "ranks in the last two weeks a number of",
    "cases per 100 000 population",
    "as you can see",
    "the blue part continues in the blue part",
    "the blue shaded counties",
    "are high incident counties",
    "when this started we had a handful of",
    "counties",
    "that were high incidents we've gone",
    "through this at different points",
    "today as you can see it's virtually",
    "takes all the way over to here all of",
    "these candles",
    "or high incident counties uh again that",
    "means there's over a hundred thousand",
    "uh per hundred thousand uh cases",
    "is how is how that is measured we'll get",
    "into some numbers in a minute",
    "uh we continue to have more and more",
    "counties exceed the cdc's threshold for",
    "high",
    "incidents as we talk about our high",
    "incidence",
    "counties in the alert system we need to",
    "remember",
    "that the incident list shows you how",
    "quickly the virus is transmitting in our",
    "communities for example",
    "let's go to the this this is the first",
    "top of the list we'll go back eric to",
    "previously we'll go this one putnam",
    "county",
    "you can see 186 cases",
    "that they've had in the last two weeks",
    "but they are at",
    "five and a half times what the high",
    "incidence rate is",
    "according to the cdc five and a half",
    "times that number",
    "and you can see as we go down to all",
    "glaze mercer jackson allen you can just",
    "see",
    "you know the high incidence is a hundred",
    "and you can see these are",
    "you know five and a half times three",
    "times",
    "some of them two times so very very",
    "high um",
    "let's go eric let's go look at the next",
    "uh slide",
    "this is our the other big indicator",
    "which is our color slide and you can see",
    "this is where we were last week",
    "uh and this is where we are",
    "uh this week and let's go to the next",
    "slide eric we'll",
    "show just that so this is where we are",
    "this week today we have an alarming",
    "number of counties that are red",
    "38 of our counties are red",
    "we also have three counties that are now",
    "on the watch list which means that",
    "they're between",

    "this is an increase from 29 red counties",
    "last week",
    "and three as i said three on the watch",
    "alert",
    "[Music]",

    "all the indicators would indicate",
    "they're purple this week but we",
    "don't post them as purple until they've",
    "done it for two weeks",
    "straight so we don't know if they're",
    "going to turn to purple or not we'll",
    "have to see what happens",

    "this is a we've continued to show this",
    "and here we are this week this is the",
    "percentage of our population that is is",
    "red",
    "um and then you see down here",
    "some in in the orange and then very very",
    "small cases now",
    "few cases that are actually in in the",
    "yellow",
    "um this means the virus is spreading",
    "throughout",
    "all the regions of the state it's",
    "penetrating everywhere",
    "we now only have four counties that are",
    "yellow",
    "this is the highest number of red",
    "counties the lowest number of yellow",
    "counties to date",
    "this means that 74 percent of ohioans",
    "are living",
    "in a red county 74",
    "only one percent are living in a yellow",
    "county",
    "now let's go back and show the alert map",

    "and every day members of my team are",
    "reaching out to these health",
    "commissioners as well",
    "what we're hearing from these officials",

    "tired uh",
    "they're laying their guard down they",
    "want to see friends and and family",
    "let me share a quick example of what we",
    "learned about",
    "from the local health department that",
    "illustrates why",
    "we just don't have the luxury of letting",
    "our guard down",
    "during the summers it got increasingly",
    "hot a factory allowed its workers to",
    "remove face coverings",
    "on unfortunately uh the employers did",
    "not start wearing masks again",
    "when it cooled off this fall now there's",
    "an outbreak of 25 employees",
    "that crosses two counties with at least",
    "two hospitalizations so far",
    "these stories continue",
    "throughout the state and again uh it is",
    "when we let our guard down chris",
    "christie's story is",
    "is you know really speaks volumes about",
    "what can happen you can be very very",
    "careful you let your guard down for a",
    "relatively short period of time and then",
    "boom",
    "um there there it is",
    "i want to talk about our watch list",
    "counties and the first one will be clark",

    "but you just have to do it a little",
    "different way and wearing the mask as",

    "this week the united states department",

    "let me now turn to lieutenant governor",
    "john",
    "thank you governor thank you very much",
    "and uh",
    "i just want to spend a little time on uh",
    "the economic recovery and",
    "and some news there and and really to",
    "help",
    "talk a little bit about how people who",
    "maybe have been displaced by what's",
    "occurred in the work in the workplace",
    "since covid or due to technology",
    "that there are a number of ways that you",
    "can transition into a new career and one",
    "of them i would like to focus on today",
    "is apprenticeships",
    "ohio is currently ranked number four in",
    "the us for the number of apprenticeships",
    "so we're",
    "we're proud of that we think we've made",
    "some some great progress in ohio on that",
    "front",
    "we have 19981 apprentices and on",
    "average this is the important part the",
    "apprentices in ohio earn as much as",
    "uh 70 thousand dollars a year",
    "or earn on average 70 000 a year we have",
    "590 sponsors",
    "of apprenticeships in the state of ohio",
    "the great thing about an apprenticeship",
    "is that",
    "you can learn and earn at the same time",
    "where",
    "you're while you're in the process of",
    "acquiring",
    "your certification the only states that",
    "are",
    "currently rank ahead of us according to",
    "the",
    "registered apprenticeship partnership",
    "information data system so",
    "we've got some factual basis for this",
    "we're california which is obviously a",
    "bigger state",
    "texas as well and south carolina and",
    "we believe that frankly we can get to",
    "number two in this one",
    "and we're going to continue to push to",
    "try to to add apprentices",
    "also of note though we are number one",
    "when you talk about state apprentices",
    "alone state sponsored apprenticeships",
    "versus federal sponsored apprenticeships",
    "so we're doing this right in ohio",
    "and if this at all sounds like of",
    "interest to you",

    "because we we do we have to",
    "we have to rally together in the",
    "smallest groups as families",
    "as communities as regions and certainly",
    "as a state and a nation",
    "and we appreciate everybody who's",
    "pulling together to try to convey these",
    "messages out there across the state of",
    "ohio",
    "back to you governor john thank you very",
    "much",
    "we'll go to questions governor first",
    "question today it's from john london at",
    "wlwt in cincinnati",
    "john hi governor uh with hamilton county",
    "now on the watch list",
    "parents teachers and students are",
    "wondering what's going to happen",
    "if their county turns purple next week",
    "you've said schools are not the spread",
    "problem that they're taking the right",
    "precautions",
    "i can tell you in recent days we've seen",
    "bars and restaurants",
    "where you'd think the pandemic had never",
    "happened packed shoulder to shoulder",
    "without mass so school families are",
    "asking",
    "since they're doing what you've said to",
    "do and certain night spots are not",
    "why should they the schools be punished",
    "at all if the county goes purple why",
    "wouldn't they be able to stay open",
    "while health departments go after the",
    "violence",
    "great question and let me let me try to",
    "try to answer that first of all",
    "there's no",
    "mandate from the state uh in regard to",
    "purple uh there's some guidance",
    "and we tell people it's a it's a",
    "heightened level of awareness a",
    "heightened level of concern um",
    "but we always tell people to look at two",
    "things",
    "look at your color but also look at",
    "number of cases per hundred thousand and",
    "we",
    "you can see it every week uh and that'll",
    "give you some idea how",
    "you compare to other other",
    "counties for example cuyahoga county the",
    "other end of the state john",
    "um you know their numbers they're way",
    "down the list",
    "um you know they're i think they're",
    "barely high incident level",
    "that's high but there's 70 other",
    "counties that have more spread than they",
    "than they do so look at",
    "where you are number of cases per 100",
    "000 in the last two weeks that really",
    "kind of tells you",
    "what your odds are of running into",
    "somebody who's got it",
    "and that's kind of how the way i would i",
    "would look at look at that so that's",
    "important",
    "the color code is",
    "seven different potential indicators",
    "kind of come together to tell you",
    "overall where you are",
    "and some of those indicators are early",
    "warning",
    "indicators and some of them are late",
    "indicators for example",
    "uh hospital more more people coming in",
    "in into that hospital",
    "the three counties that we put on the",
    "watch list",
    "all would qualify this week as purple",
    "but our system says you gotta",
    "be purple two weeks before we show you",
    "as purple",
    "so they're on our watch list they're not",
    "they're not purple now let me",
    "that what i just said is all information",
    "that i think any ohio citizen",
    "can get their hands on can look at",
    "whether you're a parent where you're a",
    "school administrator",
    "you know just an average citizen you",
    "just want to see what's going on in your",
    "county",
    "those are the two things we ask you to",
    "look at",
    "let's talk about our schools i expressed",
    "the other day",
    "a concern and a couple concerns",
    "one what is reflected in schools",
    "as far as covets spread",
    "depends on what's going on in the",
    "community if you've got",
    "four times the covid spread for example",
    "you're in a rural county it's got that",
    "you're almost bound to have some spread",
    "in your school",
    "the schools john as you indicated around",
    "this state",
    "uh i i believe from all the information",
    "i can get are doing a very good job",
    "the indicators are that we are not",
    "seeing",
    "a significant amount of spread in the",
    "schools themselves",
    "and it goes back to what i've said that",
    "what we've learned",
    "what we've learned is when people are in",
    "a a more formal setting",
    "factory workplace",
    "school people follow protocols",
    "and they wear masks they try to keep a",
    "distance",
    "as much as possible and we don't see a",
    "lot of spread generally",
    "so that would be true with the schools",
    "as it will be for",
    "for in in in business same way with",
    "colleges in classroom",
    "we don't have an indication there's much",
    "spread in the classroom",
    "spreading spreading the dorms where the",
    "school can control the situation",
    "you know there's some but we're really",
    "seeing it",
    "spread throughout society it's just",
    "people letting their guard down the",
    "examples i gave",
    "earlier today and just this social",
    "interaction and spread people not",
    "wearing mass not being careful",
    "not keeping a distance so i i would ask",
    "our",
    "educators i would ask our",
    "superintendents",
    "take all that into consideration you",
    "know in the same way",
    "with with parents i think you also have",
    "to add",
    "the fact that while",
    "some students will thrive no matter",
    "how they're taught it would seem there",
    "are many students who don't",
    "uh and there are students who don't",
    "thrive",
    "in a remote learning situation",
    "and so we are now seeing schools",
    "that some schools that were you know",
    "well remote of course",
    "in in the in the spring uh they've come",
    "back",
    "and were remote up until now some of",
    "them are announcing that they're going",
    "to stay remote",
    "at least until the end of this calendar",
    "year",
    "and i would just say look we believe in",
    "local control",
    "we believe in schools and parents making",
    "these decisions",
    "but i'm bothered as the governor frankly",
    "by schools like my kids",
    "being out of school that long and this",
    "is again an individual decision but i",
    "think that",
    "everybody needs to we continue to learn",
    "more",
    "uh we're going to do a a study",
    "but the results of that study will be",
    "it'll take a month but we're going to go",
    "into some schools uh with the school's",
    "consent",
    "and the and you know individuals consent",
    "obviously families",
    "uh and if let's say mary is in a",
    "classroom and",
    "she found out later she has coveted",
    "and it's they look back and say well she",
    "had",
    "billy over here and he was within four",
    "feet of her you know for longer than 15",
    "minutes",
    "and he's got to be quarantined and",
    "that's what the cdc says",
    "what we're going to do for schools that",
    "if we can do this trial",
    "and we intend to do this trial with new",
    "new quick tests",
    "we're going to take allow that student",
    "who is close to the other student",
    "to stay in school but to test them and",
    "test them very frequently",
    "at the same time we're going to take a",
    "another group of people",
    "in that school another group of students",
    "in that school and again with",
    "parents consent everyone's consent and",
    "test them",
    "even though they've not been exposed and",
    "we're going to see what kind of numbers",
    "that we",
    "what we see because anecdotally",
    "which is all we have now uh you know we",
    "are just not seeing a lot of spread",
    "directly in the classroom now when you",
    "go up on the",
    "on the uh",
    "portal that we have put up uh where you",
    "can look",
    "and see how many schools reporting cases",
    "um you know in some of those cases you",
    "have to drill down and look at every",
    "case but in some of those",
    "they may be school related but they may",
    "not have occurred in school",
    "they may have been students getting",
    "together uh it may have been",
    "you know parents having an alternative",
    "uh event",
    "and uh you know so it didn't it didn't",
    "occur in the school but it",
    "impacts the kids in this school so these",
    "are all things that i think",
    "you know particularly parents",
    "and school officials where kids have",
    "been out of school for some period of",
    "time",
    "i i think they all need to take all",
    "these factors into consideration",
    "uh in deciding you know what what they",
    "need to do",
    "going forward and i i apologize for a",
    "long answer but it's a",
    "it's a complex issue it's",
    "we've left it to the local community to",
    "make this decision",
    "part of my job i think is to give the",
    "local community as much information as i",
    "can",
    "and some of the new information that",
    "we're getting is we just kind of look at",
    "this",
    "anecdotally from schools is that",
    "schools like most other things in",
    "society that are more formal",
    "there's not as much spread as there is",
    "when people are just kind of getting",
    "together",
    "very informally so thanks for asking the",
    "question john",
    "next question is from danny eldridge at",
    "hannah news service",
    "hello governor how are you good um",
    "so so with hospitalizations going up i'm",
    "starting to hear that",
    "beds are already becoming an issue with",
    "hospitals running at full capacity",
    "um at what point could we go back to",
    "restricting",
    "elective surgeries and other items and",
    "what's the strategy for making sure",
    "hospitals don't go bankrupt if that is",
    "the case",
    "yeah well we don't want to go bankrupt",
    "and we also don't want them to stop",
    "doing uh elective surgeries",
    "uh you know we had the period of time",
    "where they couldn't do it",
    "when we made that initial decision in",
    "the spring that was based upon advice",
    "from hospitals",
    "the decision about when hospitals stop",
    "doing uh if they ever do stop doing",
    "elective surgeries is going to be",
    "informed by what hospitals are telling",
    "us",
    "and we're going to probably do this more",
    "on a case-by-case basis but we'll have",
    "to",
    "we'll have to take a look at that again",
    "i'm going to use every opportunity i can",
    "to reinforce this message",
    "we don't have to go there we do not have",
    "to be there",
    "we do not have to be in that situation",
    "we can control this",
    "if we get 90 85 percent of people were",
    "in mass keeping the distance",
    "uh and using their good common sense uh",
    "about the spread",
    "and we can avoid this we can turn this",
    "around",
    "um it's it's multiplying very quickly",
    "but it will continue to do that unless",
    "we do something differently",
    "and doing something differently is just",
    "more of us wearing masks and more of us",
    "being careful",
    "we've done it we've done it twice before",
    "we can do it again governor",
    "if i could if i could add on that",
    "remember also that was also due to a",
    "lack of ppe",
    "and we have worked very hard to build a",
    "supply chain for ppe",
    "that was one of the original reasons",
    "that they asked for us to",
    "to delay uh uh electives and we've we've",
    "built that out uh very well over time so",
    "that helps",
    "uh mitigate that problem and and we have",
    "we have some",
    "ohio companies we're very proud of this",
    "some ohio companies making some of this",
    "ppe now",
    "so thank you",
    "next question is from jeff redick at",
    "wsyx in columbus",
    "good afternoon governor this is the last",
    "time that we'll get to talk to you",
    "before the buckeyes return to play",
    "the university is advising fans against",
    "large gatherings",
    "at home and i wonder if you'd address",
    "that",
    "as well um also this is against the",
    "backdrop that",
    "four of the eight teams the buckeyes are",
    "scheduled to play",
    "will come from or the buckeyes will go",
    "to their states",
    "where test rates are higher or much",
    "higher than ohio",
    "so it would seem there's an interesting",
    "example to set here",
    "well i think ohio state is absolutely",
    "right",
    "the president has a good message how",
    "state athletics has a good message",
    "uh and that is the risk is not going to",
    "be",
    "um you know obviously in the stands",
    "they're going to limit it to number of",
    "people they're going to be mostly",
    "families uh that will be there",
    "i think it's a total of 1500 ohio state",
    "stadium",
    "so um we're not concerned about those",
    "fans",
    "uh they can certainly spread out they",
    "can wear masks we'll wear masks",
    "[Music]",
    "but it is the gathering of all what we",
    "do as we watch the buckeyes",
    "um and you know how we how we gather",
    "together",
    "and my message simply would be you know",
    "please be careful",
    "um you know you can watch the buckeyes",
    "but you don't have to watch them with",
    "you know a large number of people and uh",
    "you know if you feel do you feel the",
    "necessity of",
    "watching them with a group of people",
    "wear a mask you can wear a mask inside",
    "uh you know keep some distance be",
    "careful",
    "be careful about the food but you know",
    "these are all things that people can",
    "can certainly do and be very very very",
    "careful",
    "as far as teams coming from high",
    "incident states",
    "we have a high incidence we're a high",
    "incident state",
    "we may not be as high positivity um",
    "you know our positivity yesterday when i",
    "looked at was six percent",
    "for the day so it's gone from two and a",
    "half to six",
    "um not good um but as far as the",
    "you know the states where it's very very",
    "high um",
    "you know some people might ask what's",
    "the propriety of you know having these",
    "football players come in",
    "and and the reality is that they're",
    "tested quite often",
    "ohio state players are tested quite",
    "often",
    "uh you know they're following the best",
    "protocols that they can",
    "think they can find so",
    "you know that's that's what they're",
    "doing they've been very responsible",
    "um all the way through in regard to how",
    "they deal with it doesn't mean they",
    "might not have us",
    "have a spread but again the thing we",
    "always we worry about more",
    "uh it's not the formal settings it's the",
    "informal settings",
    "and that's that's what we should should",
    "worry about",
    "thank you next question is from joe",
    "ingles at ohio public radio and",
    "television",
    "hey joe good afternoon governor um i",
    "have a question about",
    "thanksgiving going back to this this",
    "question about",
    "people coming in and and coming in from",
    "all over",
    "um there's a the airlines some of the",
    "airlines are providing testing",
    "different states have different testing",
    "guidelines you just referred to it in",
    "the",
    "case with the football um but the thing",
    "is that governor christie when he was",
    "speaking he said that",
    "testing kind of made him a little bit uh",
    "overly sure of his situation do you",
    "think that",
    "that people can look at all this testing",
    "that's going on",
    "and and get a false sense of security",
    "and what's being done",
    "to make sure that that doesn't happen",
    "yes i think people uh can get a false",
    "sense of security they get",
    "they get a negative test and they think",
    "they're okay well",
    "it you know",
    "frequent testing is good um but",
    "it doesn't mean you change your behavior",
    "and i think that was the message from",
    "uh governor christie you know wear a",
    "mask",
    "or mask don't stop wearing a mask don't",
    "take that mask off just because",
    "you have tested negative today next",
    "person you may run into may have it",
    "and you don't know it and they may not",
    "know so i think that's the strong strong",
    "message",
    "you know don't don't think that because",
    "you've",
    "you've taken a test and you you're",
    "negative um",
    "that you can let your guard down i mean",
    "that's you know",
    "one of things that we've learned this",
    "virus is sneaky",
    "nasty and it can",
    "come up on you pretty quick and people",
    "can have it and they don't know they",
    "have it so the next person you run into",
    "might",
    "might have it so yeah continue to wear a",
    "mask i think that's the strong",
    "strong messages first thanksgiving get",
    "back to what we've talked about with",
    "halloween and thanksgiving before it may",
    "not be the same thanksgiving you've had",
    "in the past",
    "uh you know where a bunch of people come",
    "in from out of town and you mix a bunch",
    "of families together it just doesn't",
    "make any sense",
    "and i think we got to look at this from",
    "the long run long",
    "long view of this and the good news is",
    "that we'll we're going to get through",
    "this",
    "and we're going to break through vira",
    "you know the",
    "vaccine is coming but it's not here",
    "and uh we don't have any kind of",
    "immunity uh",
    "and so we're exposed and we're gonna",
    "we're gonna remain",
    "exposed and so once you get outside the",
    "people",
    "that live with you you gotta be alert",
    "has to go up even if they're loved ones",
    "next question is from marty schlayton at",
    "the ohio capitol journal",
    "good afternoon governor good afternoon",
    "um",
    "so the numbers that you spoke of in the",
    "antique",
    "governor christie cave i think for most",
    "rational people those would be pretty",
    "sobering",
    "um but if you looked on your twitter",
    "feed right now it's",
    "screaming with some pretty",
    "you know false stuff like uh the the",
    "spike proves",
    "that mass don't work the increase in",
    "cases is",
    "due strictly to more testing um and i",
    "just want to ask you",
    "where do you think this hostility to",
    "science comes from",
    "and do you think it's harmed the state's",
    "effort to combat the virus",
    "well first of all this is not what you",
    "ask but i'm going to use an occasion to",
    "answer it anyway",
    "or state it i'm not for any kind of",
    "censorship",
    "i'm bothered anytime there's any any",
    "censorship out there",
    "um uh you know anybody pulling stuff",
    "down",
    "from you know a company",
    "pulling something down is not the right",
    "thing to do",
    "but uh look",
    "what we can simply do is is is",
    "share data share information um",
    "you know i fully expected when",
    "governor christie came and talked that",
    "people would be on the internet right",
    "away saying diff",
    "different things i just found his story",
    "to be a compelling story",
    "when i read it when i first heard him on",
    "tv then i",
    "read the op-ed i just thought it was",
    "compelling and i thought",
    "i related to it because i think it's",
    "something that anybody could do",
    "uh you know anybody who thought okay i'm",
    "saved my",
    "heavens i'm at the white house they test",
    "everybody every day or",
    "every other day whatever it is they test",
    "people often i'm safe",
    "and he said when i walked in i put you",
    "know took my mask off when i walked out",
    "on the street and put my mask back",
    "on and and so his story i just think is",
    "a compelling",
    "compelling story the whole idea that our",
    "our uh",
    "cases are going up solely because",
    "increase in testing",
    "is just nuts i mean it's you know it's",
    "it's it's not right the biggest the way",
    "you can tell that is you know",
    "look at look at our increase in",
    "positivity generally as you go out and",
    "testing a",
    "wider wider group of people you would",
    "expect",
    "and in testing many people who don't",
    "have symptoms now",
    "uh you would expect that the positivity",
    "would go down",
    "uh that is not what's happened uh as our",
    "cases",
    "you know uh yes our cases have gone up",
    "in our positive but our positivity has",
    "gone up as well",
    "and it's you know almost double what",
    "what's more than",
    "double uh than what it was um",
    "three weeks ago so you know look people",
    "can",
    "we're always gonna have people out there",
    "who who just",
    "make arguments that don't make any sense",
    "and",
    "are not based on science and",
    "there's nothing we can do about that so",
    "we just hope that",
    "you know we believe in the first",
    "amendment and and that people will sort",
    "it out and i think in the end people do",
    "sort it out i think that's what",
    "is compelling about chris christie's",
    "story you know people can say oh gee",
    "you know i might have been in that same",
    "position",
    "next question is from bradley underwood",
    "at wkrc in cincinnati",
    "good afternoon governor um this wasn't",
    "the question i had planned on asking but",
    "based on what you've said today and some",
    "of the other questions",
    "uh when you say you know we can do this",
    "we can stop this spread",

    "that for those of my fellow ohioans who",
    "have said",
    "it doesn't impact me it's not in my",
    "county or if it's in my county it's not",

    "what i'm saying today is it's time to",
    "pay attention",
    "it is serious now it is getting worse by",
    "the minute",
    "and we see the data ever recorded every",
    "single day and the numbers just",
    "are going like this so it's time to get",
    "serious",
    "we can do this and",
    "we have it not only can ohioans do it",
    "ohioans are in the unique position",
    "to do this you know government cannot",
    "mandate unless we're in china or unless",
    "some totalitarian state",
    "and we don't want to live there and we",
    "don't want to do that government",

    "you know you're not having a party",
    "government's not going to",
    "can't be everywhere it's not going to",
    "say you know hey where's your mask",
    "ultimately there's personal",
    "responsibility here",
    "ohioans are pragmatic people",
    "uh we're tough we're strong we're",

    "we may have very high voting but we're",
    "also going to have",
    "a higher number of people voting early",

    "i think in ohio history so that should",
    "spread it out",
    "on on election day the other thing i",
    "just keep reminding",
    "everyone please please please wear a",
    "mask when you go in to vote",
    "we owe it to the workers there we owe it",
    "to the people who are there",

    "cleveland.com",
    "hi governor um as you know we're in this",
    "spike",
    "um schools and businesses and just",
    "average ohioans",
    "you know are trying to make difficult",
    "decisions to spend stem the",
    "spread of infection and keep themselves",
    "safe um",
    "yet we still don't have the contract a",
    "contact tracing data",
    "um that pinpoints the sources of the",
    "spread",
    "and we've only gotten anecdotes over the",
    "past few months",
    "when can we get some real data that",
    "shows how this virus is spreading",
    "well it's interesting that you mentioned",
    "that",
    "we had a meeting this morning",
    "specifically about that",
    "and you know what we have had",
    "so far it was a",
    "system that was designed not for the",
    "pandemic",
    "we've been trying to live with this",
    "system uh because",
    "local health departments have been",
    "overwhelmed 113 local health departments",
    "uh but we've we've made the decision",
    "that we need to",
    "you know get better data uh and so",
    "what's happening now is you know they're",
    "reporting things",
    "uh but it's you know it's it's more",
    "anecdotal",
    "and so we're going to give them a field",
    "of things to check um",
    "of you know what comes up in an",
    "interview",
    "but i would even say to tell you that",
    "even when we get that",
    "it it's not going to be in most cases",
    "many many many cases",
    "it can't be determined particularly now",
    "that we have",
    "significant significant community spread",
    "it cannot be determined where that",
    "person",
    "got it so what you may have is a list of",
    "places this",
    "person has been during that period of",
    "time might be restaurant might be a bar",
    "might be home might be family might be",
    "this might be that",
    "many times the person who's doing the",
    "tracing cannot determine",
    "you know exactly where that person got",
    "it",
    "so you'll have me you might have you",
    "could conceivably even under",
    "our new system you could conceivably",
    "have five checks",
    "seven checks different places you have",
    "no clue",
    "which of those places that person person",
    "got it from",
    "because you know it's not a case where",
    "in every case they come back and say",
    "you know like we've solved the problem",
    "we know",
    "you know that he got this at 10 o'clock",
    "at such and such a place",
    "that's just not the world we live in",
    "it's not what we have so what we're",
    "going to do",
    "is try to make it easier for the local",
    "health departments",
    "to report it by checking different",
    "options",
    "but even when we get that information",
    "you're not going to have any you know",
    "you may have some better information but",
    "it's not going to be",
    "certainly not going to be definitive um",
    "at all and so that's the challenge what",
    "you have",
    "now um is",
    "you know notes that have been taken so",
    "you can go through",
    "you can you could go through and you",
    "could do a word",
    "search but for example",
    "if the if the note taker had taken down",
    "if you",
    "if you search for bar and the note taker",
    "or restaurant",
    "and the note taker had written not in a",
    "bar or not in a restaurant",
    "that would still show up as a restaurant",
    "or show up as a bar so",
    "you know we're upping the system we hope",
    "it doesn't cost",
    "too much added time for our for the",
    "caseworkers",
    "people who are out there every day in",
    "the 113 health departments",
    "so we'll go ahead and do that but even",
    "after we do it",
    "the information we're going to get is is",
    "still going to be somewhat",
    "anecdotal",
    "next question is from jackie borchardt",
    "at the cincinnati enquirer",
    "hey jackie hey good afternoon um",
    "i'm going to go back to something you",
    "said earlier you were talking about",
    "concerns about kids being out of school",
    "and not learning well in the virtual",
    "environment",
    "and the evidence we have so far is that",
    "schools are not environments that lead",
    "to a lot of spread",
    "yet many school districts are using the",
    "color-coded map",
    "which includes cases that colleges and",
    "universities and",
    "um are not necessarily in those schools",
    "to determine whether they're going to be",
    "online or in person i guess how much",
    "should schools be looking at that",
    "color-coded map to make their decisions",
    "and um like it like you said earlier it",
    "is",
    "at odds with run hearing out of some",
    "school districts",
    "how how should schools go about making",
    "that decision of bringing the kids back",
    "or",
    "sending them home yeah look i i think if",
    "i it was my child if i was a parent",
    "uh if i was a superintendent if i was",
    "school board",
    "i tried to gather all the information i",
    "could",
    "i would look at the color code because",
    "that tells you",
    "you know overall what's going on in your",
    "county",
    "greene county where we are right now",
    "went red",
    "and you know people make decisions based",
    "based upon that it tells you something",
    "you also need to look at the list of",
    "88 counties and number of cases they've",
    "had in the last two weeks",
    "i think you also i would look at if my",
    "school was",
    "in session or if my school was in",
    "hybrid i would want to look at how many",
    "cases i'm showing up in school",
    "what show what what is what's going on",
    "in my school itself",
    "if you were in a big county uh if you're",
    "in a franklin county or cuyahoga county",
    "and i would drill down and look at my",
    "zip codes",
    "or zip code where my school is because",
    "you know what what may be happening in",
    "one part of the county it may not be",
    "quite reflected the same in the other",
    "although the spread now is just going",
    "you know it's going everywhere",
    "but i also would look at my students and",
    "i would try to try to make a",
    "determination if i was",
    "going remote how are they doing uh how",
    "do we",
    "how do i think this is working out for",
    "these students",
    "if i was hybrid the days that were",
    "remote these kids are remote if i was",
    "totally remote i'd want to say well look",
    "how we doing",
    "everybody's trying but how how is this",
    "getting",
    "delivered or the kids getting it and i",
    "would look",
    "i would look at that so i think it's you",
    "got there's no one",
    "solution in every school district's",
    "different",
    "uh but i would want to look at all of",
    "those things",
    "and then make a determination and look",
    "throughout this virus",
    "everything is a balancing act everything",
    "is you you're balancing",
    "time after time we're looking at choices",
    "and neither which",
    "neither choice is great in fact some",
    "choices are bad",
    "both bad ones just worse than the other",
    "one",
    "and so you've got to figure out what's",
    "the risk risk to the kids",
    "risk to the teachers you've got to",
    "figure out",
    "you know how much how well are these",
    "students doing or can they do remotely",
    "uh how well can they do in in person",
    "what's the weather and the weather being",
    "the color-coded map and",
    "and being the number of cases that that",
    "we've got",
    "so i think i would look at you know all",
    "of those things",
    "and that's why you know i appreciate",
    "your question because i really wanted to",
    "cover this today because i've been",
    "talking last night to a school",
    "superintendent from hamilton county i've",
    "talked to others",
    "and um there's no magic to this there's",
    "no",
    "[Music]",
    "if this then we automatically do this",
    "these are these are judgment calls",
    "that are being made by good people under",
    "very",
    "very very difficult and adverse",
    "conditions",
    "next question is from jack windsor at",
    "wmfd in mansfield",
    "hey jack hi governor",
    "hey thank you for answering my question",
    "on tuesday about whether the state would",
    "mandate vaccines or",
    "require immunity certificates you said",
    "that that you wouldn't",
    "however the second part of my question",
    "from tuesday was unanswered and i'd like",
    "to get your answer on that today if i",
    "may",
    "will you allow others to mandate",
    "vaccines for example",
    "allowing businesses to require employees",
    "to vaccinate in order to work",
    "or maybe prospective customers and will",
    "you allow schools to press for vaccines",
    "for kids",
    "despite ohio's existing exemptions for",
    "kids k-12",
    "since many boards uh school boards now",
    "are currently not honoring",
    "mass exemptions well",
    "you know our law is clear in regard to",
    "school kids",
    "so you know i would see no uh",
    "change in that law at all",
    "uh in regard to school case uh we would",
    "encourage people to get",
    "the flu shot we encourage them to get",
    "you know",
    "all kinds of different shots uh but the",
    "law is what the law is in regard to",
    "to our school children that's one that's",
    "one category",
    "as far as your your other question about",
    "whether a business could require",
    "everyone that",
    "would work work there to have to have a",
    "shot",
    "something i will talk talk to the",
    "general assembly",
    "we generally allow decisions like that",
    "to be made in the workplace",
    "if they directly impact the welfare of",
    "the people",
    "who are working there and we generally",
    "allow those judgment calls to be made by",
    "the employers uh who can set a a",
    "condition of work but i want to talk to",
    "the speaker i want to talk to senate",
    "president i want to consult with other",
    "members of the general assembly",
    "to kind of get their feeling in regard",
    "to that",
    "thank you next question is from jess",
    "hardin at mahoningmatters.com",
    "hi governor thanks for taking my",
    "question today",
    "after you issued the statewide mass",
    "mandate in july i spoke with",
    "health officials in mahoning trumbull",
    "and columbiana counties",
    "and when they receive a complaint about",
    "mass non-compliance",
    "they typically send someone out to check",
    "on how the business is enforcing the",
    "mandate",
    "there are essentially no repercussions",
    "for consumers who choose not to wear",
    "masks",
    "the best each department can do is for",
    "to ask that proper signage is in place",
    "and to to enforce that",
    "they've noted that the directive has",
    "written is extremely difficult to",
    "enforce and places a burden on already",
    "burdened health departments",
    "why not treat non-compliance with the",
    "mass mandate like a parking ticket and",
    "use",
    "police or mask watchers or some force to",
    "flag individual people in public who do",
    "not wear masks um",
    "this is being done all over the country",
    "it's being in new york and connecticut",
    "and charleston south carolina and a",
    "bunch of cities in california",
    "it's possible um but you know you've",
    "been begging ohioans to wear a mask for",
    "three months and it seems that we",
    "you know see cases rise again and and",
    "you have to make the same plea",
    "why not hold ohioans a cannonball for a",
    "mandate they're supposed to be following",
    "if encouraging masking is your strategy",
    "for responding to these concerning",
    "numbers",
    "well every time",
    "the situation has got dire mohamed's",
    "have stepped up",
    "so i have to believe that they're going",
    "to step up again this time when they",
    "fully understand the data",
    "and looking at this data as it evolves",
    "uh and as we explain it every couple",
    "days",
    "every tuesday and thursday i think more",
    "ohioans are going to wear a mask i'm",
    "already getting",
    "some calls from legislators say that",
    "well we're we're in mass more in our",
    "county or this",
    "or this county uh as far as uh you know",
    "issuing tickets",
    "um quite candidly when we put this mass",
    "order out we did not ask",
    "of sheriffs or or police departments to",
    "issue tickets but",
    "many of them um uh you know made it very",
    "clear",
    "uh you know we're not in the mass",
    "business we're not gonna do it",
    "uh we're not gonna we're not gonna issue",
    "issue those tickets so",
    "um you know it's it's it's not",
    "and as you say uh the health department",
    "does not have the",
    "the people uh to be everywhere",
    "uh what i would say though is this that",
    "if if and i think our businesses have",
    "done a very",
    "good job but if someone's working in a",
    "business",
    "where the mask order is not being",
    "enforced we would like to hear about it",
    "and we will take action again i think",
    "businesses are doing a very very good",
    "job but if you're you're you're a",
    "employee",
    "and you have to go work in a situation",
    "where people are",
    "ignoring the mass order and therefore",
    "threatening your health",
    "and safety you should not have to work",
    "under those",
    "under those conditions and i would also",
    "say to our retail",
    "uh outlets um",
    "law is clear you know what our order is",
    "clear is that you need to have your",
    "employees wear a mask",
    "i think to protect those mat those",
    "employees",
    "uh you know a consistent policy uh in",
    "in your business about not serving",
    "people",
    "if they don't have a mask on uh now that",
    "you know i understand no one wants to",
    "turn away business",
    "but again you've got an obligation to",
    "protect your",
    "your employees and that's they're the",
    "ones who are on the front line",
    "uh you know every single day",
    "next question is from jim province at",
    "the toledo blade",
    "hi governor um on tuesday you told me",
    "that",
    "you believe that there had been some",
    "cases of spread involving the recent",
    "political rallies in western ohio",
    "but you wanted to double check i wanted",
    "to get back to you now and see what",
    "what you learned from that yeah our team",
    "told me uh",
    "that day that they did not had not seen",
    "uh from the local health departments any",
    "indication",
    "doesn't mean it didn't occur it's like",
    "everything else you can have spread you",
    "just don't know it",
    "uh from a particular event so it could",
    "have but",
    "but i was wrong about that uh i was",
    "incorrect about that",
    "they at least as",
    "of tuesday when i checked after the",
    "press conference",
    "they came back to me and told me that",
    "they had not seen any examples",
    "we will go back and check again from",
    "local health departments and if local",
    "health departments say they've got",
    "spread well then they're the ones who",
    "are on the front line",
    "but we try to stay in touch with them",
    "obviously to find out what's",
    "you know what's going on so to my",
    "knowledge we don't have any",
    "that we know of next question is from",
    "john reed at gangwar news service",
    "good afternoon governor um with the",
    "rise in hospital admissions and the",
    "increased number of beds being used",
    "how close are we to needing those",
    "auxiliary",
    "facilities like the convention centers",
    "and things like that",
    "and how ready are those to go if they",
    "are needed",
    "well i can tell you you know we we put",
    "together with the ohio hospital",
    "association",
    "a system early on in march of this",
    "this pandemic and so it's a good system",
    "nothing like this i don't think it's",
    "ever been done",
    "in ohio before uh and it it zones as you",
    "know it's",
    "andy thomas dr thomas was on the other",
    "day",
    "and these three these zone leaders uh",
    "three different zones they get together",
    "all the time",
    "uh and then they in turn are getting",
    "together with all the hospitals",
    "uh that they have in their zone so it's",
    "a system of bigger hospitals smaller",
    "hospitals",
    "you know we're monitoring all kinds of",
    "different things",
    "so i have every confidence in the system",
    "that's been set up",
    "we had built out and plans for",
    "build-out well-defined plans for",
    "build-out",
    "in the spring that did not have to be",
    "implemented",
    "we had some build out that was pulled",
    "back so",
    "there's room and there's room to grow",
    "not what we want to see",
    "but you know there is room to grow now",
    "uh at the rate these cases are expanding",
    "uh which is just it's skyrocketing",
    "you know this can change and so where we",
    "are in a week from now or two weeks from",
    "now i can't tell you",
    "but i can tell you what they're telling",
    "me now",
    "and that you know they don't like to see",
    "the icu increase they don't like",
    "certainly the hospital emission increase",
    "and part of what you know we're looking",
    "at is",
    "the age and i'll go back to june and",
    "july and june and july we were seeing a",
    "younger group of people",
    "getting it uh we think that you know",
    "that younger group may have been",
    "some of them at least may have infected",
    "older people but we're seeing an older",
    "group",
    "now and that does not bode well uh for",
    "what goes on inside the hospital",
    "now you know medical care today is",
    "everybody knows more uh you know your",
    "odds are better",
    "uh but we're still as you can see still",
    "losing people every single day",
    "who die of covet and it's still you know",
    "it's still to some extent like you know",
    "you're rolling the dice",
    "uh and that's what chris christie",
    "described is being in there and",
    "you know you're in isolation they tell",
    "you yeah you're doing a little better",
    "whatever you're doing but you don't know",
    "that this thing could turn",
    "overnight and then you're in you've got",
    "a ventilator or whatever they have to",
    "they have to do so um",
    "we're going to keep you informed uh the",
    "hospitals will keep us informed we talk",
    "with them all the time and",
    "you know when we start seeing a crisis",
    "in one area we're going to talk about it",
    "but but we do know that when you have",
    "this many cases expanding as fast as",
    "they are and if they continue to expand",
    "at this rate you're going to have more",
    "people go to the hospital",
    "and we know when we have more people go",
    "to the hospital you're going to end up",
    "with more people in icu",
    "and that's not good next question is",
    "from josh roltenberg at spectrum news",
    "hi governor um you said that ohioans",
    "still have time to turn this around",
    "and you've also signaled to those that",
    "haven't taken this seriously in the past",
    "to now take it seriously",
    "uh but how much time are you going to",
    "give ohioans or at what point do you",
    "consider a shutdown",
    "if nearly three-fourths of the state is",
    "living in danger of contracting the",
    "virus",
    "josh want to see um you know i'm i'm an",
    "optimist as i told you i think ohioans",
    "are going to react to this",
    "and and i'm not just that's not just",
    "wishful thinking ohioans have done it",
    "twice before",
    "there's no reason to think ohio's can't",
    "step up again it won't step up again",
    "if you look at the tools if you look at",
    "the tools i have",
    "and you look at the tools that all of us",
    "collectively have as ohioans",
    "the tools that ohioans collectively have",
    "far exceed any kind of tool that i have",
    "because no matter what order you issue",
    "no matter what order you issue it",
    "depends upon people's compliance with",
    "the order",
    "and so you know collectively we have the",
    "power",
    "we have the power to turn this thing",
    "around",
    "uh and we can do it and we need and we",
    "need to do it",
    "the tools that i have as governor",
    "you know are not nearly as great as the",
    "tools that people the state of ohio have",
    "collectively",
    "governor next question is the last",
    "question for today and it belongs to jim",
    "otty at whio in dayton jim governor on",
    "that hi governor",
    "on that last point talking about trying",
    "to",
    "get compliance here in the state of ohio",
    "you can't compel compliance but for",
    "those people who have been skeptical in",
    "the past did remain so",
    "what seems to be the problem here what's",
    "wrong with this picture uh is it a",
    "matter of",
    "people just don't trust you or they",
    "don't trust us",
    "because we're reporting on what you have",
    "to say do we need those skeptics to be",
    "able to complete the circle to make sure",
    "that this is all taken care of and we",
    "can",
    "stop this spread well",
    "jim this is a little a little a little",
    "joke but",
    "you know maybe they're not watching our",
    "press conference and maybe they're not",
    "watching you at six o'clock on channel",
    "seven i you know i don't know",
    "i mean people are getting their",
    "information from a lot of different",
    "places today",
    "and um you know i",
    "i i understand that but i think",
    "in all seriousness part of it is people",
    "just tired",
    "they're sick of it you know we're used",
    "to going fighting a battle and getting",
    "it over with and winning and",
    "being done with it whether that's a",
    "medical battle or any other kind of",
    "battle",
    "this is just different this is a long",
    "struggle",
    "this is a long struggle that tests us as",
    "ohio ones",
    "but it's a struggle we will win and",
    "when we win it we want to have as many",
    "ohioans there",
    "to celebrate as we can",
    "we have a common common enemy and it's",
    "not",
    "masked versus those who believe in mass",
    "those who don't",
    "we're not enemies we're on the same team",
    "and so",
    "i i think you know highlands can pull",
    "together",
    "uh i think we need to pull together this",
    "is something that we can do together",
    "it's in our best interest each one of us",
    "to do this",
    "it's the best interests of our families",
    "and so we can do this",
    "and i think we will do this we can we",
    "can fight",
    "fight back i want to close with a",
    "new commercial that we're putting up uh",
    "it kind of speaks for itself",
    "but it's apt that just worked out this",
    "way that today we're unveiling it today",
    "we're putting it up",
    "so people will be have a chance to see",
    "it but it really describes i think",
    "exactly what is happening in ohio",
    "today",
    "all it takes to start a chain reaction",
    "is to let up",
    "you stop keeping a safe distance take a",
    "break from your mask",
    "and suddenly an outbreak and another",
    "and another affecting the people in your",
    "circle",
