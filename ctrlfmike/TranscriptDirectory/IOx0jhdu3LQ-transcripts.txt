good afternoon everyone
fran will be joining me in a moment um
talk a little bit about the dolly parton
imagination library
and the progress that has been made in
the last year
wearing a tie from hiram college
james garfield was a graduate of hiram
this is the 100th anniversary of women's
suffrage 100 years ago
august 18th 1920
tennessee became the 36th and the final
state
to ratify the 19th amendment to the
united states
constitution ohio i might say had
already ratified the 19th amendment more
than a year earlier
on june 16th 1919
i think back think about where my
grandmothers were
my grandmother little had just turned
20.
and my grandmother
alice dewine was 20
24. so my grandmother ruth little was
20.
and i just wondered what they thought
about that
i remember my grandmother little talking
a little bit
about that but uh i wish i had the
opportunity now
to uh to really ask them how that how
that was
this is also a
interesting year for women 100 years ago
to get
the opportunity to vote particularly for
ohioans because
the choice for president they had two
ohioans
warren g harding newspaper publisher
from
marion ohio and james cox a newspaper
publisher from
dayton ohio so quite a quite a
year in april of last year i signed
senate bill
30 which created the women's suffrage
centennial commission
to crim commemorate this milestone
now with the onset of the pandemic our
ability to really celebrate
in person at least has been curtailed
but i encourage everyone
to learn more about the history of the
women's suffrage movement the ohio
history connection
a good place to learn a lot of things
has many resources
including for teachers on its webpage at
ohiohistory.org
and tourism ohio has created a women's
history road
trip that features eight different sites
and that is
at ohio.org you also
might want to ask anyone in your family
who was alive then and
ask them what they remember from that
time
let me now introduce uh my wife fran
who's going to talk
a little bit about the imagination
library and the
results that we have had so far and she
is wearing a
vote votes for women
good afternoon i also have on a
special mask today that you can see
through i read an article this past week
about two young women at miami
universities taking a disability
class and these
these masters made one of the girls was
making these actually
four kids who have disabilities so that
you know
that they could read their lips and so i
think this would be a great thing you
know
if you have a child and he's something
special i think this would be a great
thing
i actually found three different
patterns one of them is
is shaped kind of like a smile that you
can wear
and uh this one actually kind of has a
chin
in it so there's a lot of different
patterns online and the trick is it's
it's a vinyl insert and if you put
just a drop of dishwasher soap on it and
then wipe it off and it won't steam up
when you're talking
so um but during this
pandemic you know a lot is change you
know our work routine our kids
but a lot of things are the same and
still
these kids are growing up and we as
parents
are their main teachers with their best
teachers
and so i hope that you're tapping
the resources of the ohio governor's
imagination library
if you have little ones under five years
old now if you remember
this these are books
free in the mail for children they get a
book every month from the time they're
born until they turn five years old so
we'll hope you'll make sure your kids
are signed up i just
put a couple of these books out here you
know the very my very favorite book
is the very first one they get it's uh
the little engine that could
uh every child gets this no matter what
age that they are when they when they
sign
up and another favorite over the years
and i love reading this to kids because
kids love reading it themselves it's
the very hungry caterpillar so it's just
a great book
but we really started about a year ago
here in ohio
um and it's been quite a year since we
started
we've expanded this program it was here
and it was in many
many areas pockets of ohio but we
expanded it to
every almost every county now
so we're hoping to to
make sure that every child gets it last
summer when we started our push
it was available and about about 93 000
kids had signed up
today with the help of first of all our
friends from the state legislature who
put some money in
and our county affiliates who've signed
up
and we've got lots of you know new funds
and so now we have over 180 000 kids
signed up so we more than doubled
la i i visited myself just this year
between january and march i visited 16
counties
and just recently we added two more
counties
we added clermont county and morgan
county so we're really happy to
to welcome them so now it's available
county-wide in 78 of ohio's 88 counties
and after one year you know we've
doubled it so that
that means 191 000 kids are getting a
free book in the mail
every single month
so in the remaining 10 counties we
really hope to get those up and running
soon we're looking for partners to make
sure every child in the county can
receive those books
these ten counties ashland columbiana
crawford lake mercer ottawa richland
sandusky seneca and van word
if you can help please contact us
through our website
which is the ohio imagination library
dot org
in september we'll be celebrating our
one year anniversary
those counties are not those counties
don't have
those counties do not have it yet we'll
be celebrating our kids and families our
community partners
and our legislators who are investing in
our children
but i know we have more work to do this
year and i look forward to the day
hopefully very soon when every child in
ohio is receiving the benefits of the
ohio governor's imagination library
thank you
thanks fran
fran i want to send our best wishes
to state senator tina maharath of
columbus
who announced on twitter last night that
she and some of her family members have
been diagnosed with
with kova 19 so our prayers go out to to
her
and to her family
we learned last night that we now have
our first confirmed case of cobia 19
at our ohio veterans home in georgetown
brown county an employee has been tested
positive
the how department of veterans services
had been able to keep the
chronovirus out of this nursing home all
this time
since the start of the pandemic but
sadly we are seeing
more community spread in our rural
counties and certainly brown county has
significant community spread is one of
the
12 counties uh you know red level 3
public emergency
this week the employee has not been at
work since thursday morning but it
appears that at least two other
employees
may have been exposed to this individual
this has triggered veterans services to
put additional safety measures in place
at the home and they're tracking all
potential
exposures because we've been testing
staff in georgetown regularly
all staff had already been scheduled to
be tested yesterday
and today and that is taking place
additionally all residents in the unit
where this employee works are being
tested as are the residents in the two
other units where the potentially
exposed employees
are assigned as we do each
day we will continue updating any change
in case numbers at ohio's two veterans
home on our website
chronovirus.ohio.gov
so today we're going to talk about
sports
i know a much anticipated subject
by many people throughout the state
um i thought we would talk first talk
with dr jim borchers dr borchers
has had extensive experience
in working in this particular area uh at
ohio state university
and uh doctor are you on here yet
eric is he is he here i am here
what's up doctor thank you so very very
much for
joining us and i know you've worked with
athletes at ohio state
and i wonder maybe if you could just
kind of start off by telling us what
what you have learned i mean i know that
we continue
uh the medical community continues to
learn more as we move forward with covet
and
have more experiences and it's an
evolving situation and
maybe just kind of share with us some of
the things that that that you have seen
uh in your work uh at ohio state in
general and your work with
with the athletes well governor thanks
for having me today and
uh very happy to be here you know our
uh experiences uh allowed us really to
study the effect of covet and
and its effects uh not only on athletics
but on sport and participation and i
think
probably the first thing that we've
learned is that uh
the health of the community around our
athletes is
utmost importance to our athletes being
able to compete
when we are able to provide our athletes
with a healthy environment
and are able to have them follow the
basic behaviors that
we've all been asked to follow around
this virus which is appropriate
social distancing and
good hygiene face mask and following
proper procedures
in and around the sport facilities and
around conducting athletics
um that that makes a makes a large
difference for us
when the community does not have a
healthy environment when we see a large
infectivity rate
we have found that uh it's more
difficult
and we struggle sometimes to have uh
athletics and sport and organize sports
so i think that is probably first and
foremost the most
important thing and i think the second
thing we've
you know known and i think everyone
knows is just how important athletics
and sport is to our mental health and
well-being and uh
how important it is that we all join in
together to allow sports to occur
well that's great and doctor i apologize
i kind of rushed into this i was
anxious to hear from you i didn't really
give you the the proper introduction but
let me just do it uh for everyone uh
dr portrait specializes in sports
medicine at the wexner medical center
uh he's some first-hand experience as a
former ohio state football
player from 1989 to 1993 will give your
age away i guess there doctor
there you go it was inspired to be a
doctor in part by his physicians who
cared for him when he was a student
athlete so doctor thank you very very
much
we have heard dr um
one of the things that is in the order
that we're
putting out today talks about
myocarditis
but also sudden cardiac arrest which i
know
has been something that i think people
have been concerned about for a long
time
i remember years ago having
seen that tragedy reported one night for
a ud basketball player
i have a good friend of mine
from congress whose son died
at a very very young age playing playing
college basketball
uh from from that so maybe you could
start with that
and then talk how those two are maybe or
are related or not related but
just some things that uh coaches and and
athletic directors and
and everyone else connected with sports
maybe should
maybe should think about sure well i
think
as you mentioned sudden cardiac death in
athletes is a tragic event
and it fortunately is a very rare event
it's not
something that's common but something
that we almost always hear some
reports of and really requires vigilance
on preparation so all our great athletic
trainers around the state of ohio that
are
providing excellent emergency care
our cpr training and the use of a
automated external defibrillator are
really the ways that we can
you know save lives and so even more
important than screening is our
preparation and so
obviously i know our coaches athletic
trainers medical staffs administrators
around the state really take a lot of
great pride and have
done a great job at instituting that
that being said we know one of the risk
factors for sudden cardiac death is
infection of the heart or what you've
mentioned myocarditis and
although not the most common cause can
be a cause of sudden cardiac death and
arrhythmia
certainly in athletes and one of the
things that we continue to study and
look at with
covet 19 is its predilection
for potentially affecting the heart with
infection and so
it's one of the issues that has been
discussed quite a bit it's one of the
issues that we're learning quite a bit
about
and certainly that we want to remain
vigilant for but i think it highlights
the need for again
prevention for healthy communities and
trying to allow
you know rather than worrying about what
we do when that occurs which is a rare
event
how can we prevent it from occurring and
i think those are those things that
you and others have talked about in
trying to allow our athletes to
compete in a healthy environment so
let's talk for a moment of say
an athlete who has the symptoms of covid
um let's just assume they're they're
tested
comes back positive athlete does not
exhibit you know any kind of major
problem never has to go to the hospital
for example
that person's now hopes to come back and
play what
you're the doctor what do you advise the
the coach what do you advise the parents
what do you advise the athlete
yeah i think what i would advise
everyone governor is that that athlete
if they've been coveted positive meets
with their health care
provider and makes certain that they
have discussed you know the health risks
and that they've had a complete
assessment
before they return to sport and that may
then you know be different for each
uh individual and so certainly that
could involve
uh not only an exam but other cardiac
testing ekgs echocardiograms you know
um lab work other specialized cardiac
tests and the
use of a cardiac specialist if needed
but i think
anyone who's had been coveted positive
needs to meet with their health care
provider or seek out that advice
before they return to activity to make
certain that they understand also the
signs and symptoms to watch out for
shortness of breath any chest discomfort
exercise fatigue you know
a middle-aged runner who maybe used to
be able to run a eight-minute mile
that's now only able to run 12 or 13
minute miles these are the things that
might alert our health care providers to
looking at something more specific so
not that we need to be
i think overly scared of this
complication but we need to be aware of
it okay
very very good i asked you this morning
uh a question um
i said if you had a child who
was wanting to play contact sports this
fall
uh would you let them do it yeah you did
ask me that
question and i've been asked that
question quite a bit and i have uh
two high school age boys who play sports
a daughter who was a very competitive
athlete and and my response to you is
the response i'm gonna give now and that
i think that every individual needs to
look at what's going on in their
environment and kind of what their
community looks like if the infectivity
rate of this virus is
extremely high and and we don't have the
ability to test i'd have some real
concerns about letting my son
play a contact sport that being said if
i lived in a community where the
infectivity rate is well controlled
where it's low where
i felt like our community had embraced
the guidelines to allow the athletes to
compete in a healthy manner then i would
you know feel better about letting my
son go forward so i think it
you have to take into account what's
going on in your local community what's
going on in your
you know more extended community and i
think that's why it's so incumbent on
all of us to
to you know do the best we can to
prevent
as much spread as possible okay good
doctor thank you very very much one
maybe one last last question
um in regard to let's
a situation where um
one of the athletes on a team comes down
with covenants confirmed that student
has covered what does that mean for the
other athletes on that team or what
might it mean
yes it's fact i assume it's fact driven
pretty much here but what what might
that mean or
what what should happen sure so i think
i think first and foremost we want to
share information to prevent the
you know unnecessary spread of that so
we want to make certain that
um that we make aware those aware that
there could be a positive
case and then i think that's where
contact tracing is we've
heard a lot about become so important
that we don't have an unnecessary
shutdown so to speak of a large group of
people that we have the ability
to make certain that those close
contacts are appropriately
notified and follow cdc guidance and
others on self quarantine
the inability to do that or the
inability to provide that information is
probably going to lead to health
departments
recommending that entire groups of
people entire teams or even entire
leagues potentially not participate for
a period of time and that can be really
disruptive to sport
so certainly that sort of communication
is going to be really important and
something that we need to be
very vigilant about great doctor thank
you very very much
we appreciate you being with us thank
you thank you
eric let's go to our uh quickly to our
our slides here
eric is behind the camera trying to do a
bunch of different things
at one time this is our regular slide
that comes up
um as we'll see the cases we certainly
like we don't like see any cases but
that number is better than some of the
numbers we've been seeing 861
deaths tragically 39 people
hospitalizations we see also are up
uh and icu admissions are are up
uh eric if we could go to the latest
version of our top 10 ohio counties
ranked by incidents
these are i believe new numbers let me
look at the dates here
yeah this this goes up to today uh we'll
see that
and these are again counties
where we're trying to compare based on
population so
how much has been spread what are the
number of cases in the last
14 days based on population so it's
last last 14 days per 100 000 population
mercer county is at 2 45 still number
one although
down a little bit dark county lawrence
county
meigs county preble shelby sandusky
perry champaign all glaze
so for the first time the top 10
counties are are basically rural
counties
and this is what we continue to see we
continue to see this significant spread
out into our rural areas
so it is obviously very very concerning
we do have good news the positivity
overall statewide
is is coming down and we're happy
happy about that and we're also seeing
in our urban areas
uh generally a lowering uh in the number
number of cases and so that is
that is good so
we will be issuing an order and best
guidance in regard to
sports this is really the best
guidance that can be provided by the
health experts and the medical
experts but the caveat always is that
like anything else in life it depends on
how it is executed
so we would just ask people when this
comes out in the next within the next
day
just take a look at it kind of go
through it
but let me give you the give you the
highlights
so we will be releasing this order and
really it's about how
we can provide the best advice
to how sports in ohio are conducted
this includes not only high school
athletes not only situations that are
under the ohio
high school athletic association's
umbrella
but any kind of sports and organized by
basically anybody
uh in the state so it applies to all
athletes all teams
whether under this umbrella the ohio
high school
athletic association or or not
we have certainly heard from parents
we've heard from athletes
we've talked young people coaches
doctors
and and health experts
just maybe kind of a few
thoughts about this and kind of our
thinking process
we know first of all that just as going
back to school in person
does increase the risk of spread we know
that
sports do particularly contact
sports they do as well uh further we
know
that as dr borcher said
uh several times the more spread there
is
in a community um the more spread
there's going to be in the school
and the higher risk there's going to be
to the students and certainly to the
athletes as well
on the other hand we all know the
importance of sports
we've seen that fran and i have seen
that with with our own children
we've seen it with our own grandchildren
sports matters it makes a difference
sports provides all the things that we
know discipline
brings order structure in the lives of
student athletes
and certainly brings joy to those
athletes and
certainly to their families as well
uh any decision about playing sports or
not playing sports
simply cannot be made in a vacuum uh
that
young person if they're not playing
sports will obviously be doing
something else with their time
and that has to be kept in mind as well
we also know of course that each young
person is different
each young person has different needs
each young person is a different point
in their life with different
different needs different situations
again our order provides what we hope is
the best guidance
to play sports as safely as that can be
played
in the era of kogan 19.
so our order will provide that all
sports
may go forward uh this fall with contact
and the non-contact sports
again we lay out exactly the roadmap
and how this should take place and what
has to be done to make it as safe as
as possible we also though have heard
from superintendents
persons from families for a desire
to switch some of these contact sports
football soccer field hockey uh to the
spring
lieutenant governor and i have had
conversations with the ohio
high school athletic association uh and
they have given the go ahead for schools
that
want to do that to move to the spring
as we go through this frankly we know
some schools are still deciding
some schools have already made up their
mind they've already already announced
our goal is to provide is to focus on
the
student and to focus on the school
and provide them the best opportunity
they can
so that young person can participate no
one can
guess what the future is going to be we
don't know frankly
what the situation is going to be or how
far into the season we'll be able to get
or we can get all the way into the
season we certainly hope
uh right now nor do can we predict if
things
will be better when it would become time
to play these sports
in in the spring but
this order simply allows sports to move
forward
and we have heard it expressed by some
superintendents and
others that they would like to be able
to have a season
but they don't want to have a season now
we've certainly heard from other schools
and other parents who say we want that
season now
we think this is the best
thing to happen for many many many
reasons
we have noticed that
a good number of our urban schools our
city schools um
have decided not to go back in person
and they've also decided not to have
fall sports
so if there was no opportunity in the
spring to play
and again we can't predict the future we
don't know what
that's going to look like uh but there
is hope
and they will at least have hope and we
hope actually a season
uh they've already made the decision not
to play in the fall so
we don't want to exclude those children
either
we want to give them the hope and the
opportunity to also have
a season
under our orders let me talk for a
moment about spectators
um everyone i've i've talked to
virtually everyone i've talked to has
put the focus exactly where it should be
and that focus should be
on young people letting them play
it's also important i believe that that
young person have
someone there if possible to support
them
there are people there many times as
family members
sometimes it may be someone else who's
very very close
to the family or very very close to that
particular
young person so when our order comes out
what you will see is that we will not
have spectators
other than other than family members
or people very close uh to that
particular child and we'll leave that
course up to the school
you know how to do that we also know
if you talk for example football
in other sports too but i associate this
with football more and that is a
marching band
that might be a drill team that might be
other things that happen during halftime
and so we would want to provide an
opportunity for those parents as well
to be able to come and observe
what is going on so we'll have more
details on that
when the order is actually issued but
that's the
basic uh underpinning
in regard to spectators i think what
you'll see when you look at the orders
there's no big surprises
the health guidance that is in there is
pretty much the guidance that you have
heard from us but you've also heard
on tv you've read in the newspaper
no no big big surprises
i would just express a hope i have a lot
of hopes but
one hope is that
the desire to have a season
i hope that the desire to have a season
will inspire
our young people our athletes our
student athletes
24 7 to be as careful as they can
and i hope also that our coaches and and
john houston and i will be talking with
coaches uh
later today and several different calls
we're also going to be talking to
to superintendents athletic directors
uh on conference calls but our hope is
that the coaches will
use this as an opportunity to to focus
uh
on helping these young people uh
understand what really is at stake
uh and that if they're gonna be able to
play whatever sport it is they're
playing
whether it is soccer football whatever
it is
that they're going to have to do
everything they can to keep covet out
of their their team
so i hope and i believe it will
work uh the driving force that will
inspire our young men
our young women uh to make decisions
in their lives 24 7
and i hope that will inspire them to
make the right decisions to give them
the opportunity
to have the best chance they can to play
their sport to the coaches uh
you in a normal year uh inspire
you mentor you instruct
you instill discipline self-discipline
to your student athletes
for all of that we're very very grateful
parents grandparents everybody else
connects with that child we're very
grateful for what you do you make a lot
of sacrifices
uh you work long hours and you inspire
our kids and so we thank you very very
much
for that but this year this year um
it's going to take more it's going to be
inspiring them
uh in regard to the goal of
keeping covert
[Music]
so
[Music]
hmm
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
children who have been signed up for the
imagination library so if you've not
done so go on go online and
and do that so that's good good good
news
just to conclude success this year in
sports is going to be
measured always by wins and losses and
efforts and
all the things that we you know measure
sports by
but it's also going to be measured
certainly to some extent how well
we can keep the covet away from the team
away from away from the athletes
i think by what we're doing today we're
empowering
our young people we're empowering the
parents we're empowering the schools
to take all the evidence all the
information
and make the best judgment call for that
child
for those children these are tough
tough calls play contact sports
now um
play them in the spring don't play them
um you know these these are all um
tough decisions uh there's not
necessarily a right or wrong
answer we just ask everyone to
to weigh everything make the individual
best decision for that
for that particular child for that team
for that for that school
what we want to do is give as many
options
as possible out there for everyone
as dr borchus pointed out
community itself whatever that community
is that's going to
as far as the covet spread you're going
to see that in the schools
you can take a small rural county that
county can probably
look at the numbers and get a pretty
good idea what that spread is
get a very good idea what that recent
spread is
in the community if you're in a big
urban county
you know much more diverse many more
people
you may have to look at that data more
down more granular more in regard to the
zip code and and things like that but
this information is there
uh if we can help anybody uh
superintendents or anyone
you know dig down into that information
we're more than happy
uh to try to help them
sports is about a lot of things but one
of the things it's about is hope
it doesn't matter what sport it is
hope springs eternal when you when you
start
and so that's we'll end on that that
happy
happy thought but i would just say that
hope itself is is not a plan it's not a
strategy
we all should have hope but we also
should have a plan
so we would ask you those who are making
the decision to play
we wish you every success in the world
we wish your kids every success
in keeping covet away
look at the plan we have and try the
best you can
to to execute that because we believe
that gives you the best chance
your kids the best chance of being able
to play
a season let me now turn it over to the
lieutenant governor
uh john we're a little delayed getting
to you but uh
we have had a little intermission there
so over to the lieutenant governor
great thank you governor uh i know
you've made
a lot of decisions in your governorship
but
i don't think you've made one that's
been more anticipated by teenagers than
this one
and uh i know that hope is a powerful
sustaining presence in our lives and
for a lot of student athletes you've
given them a good dose of hope today so
thank you
for your decision look i know that when
we started working on this from the very
beginning coaches and student athletes
said you know give us a chance give us a
chance to do this and
and today they have that chance they
have that opportunity
but much like the sport you play your
success is going to be
based on how well you execute the game
plan
athletes coaches and families are going
to have to demonstrate the discipline
to follow the rules so that they can
protect themselves and their teammates
and
and control if not stop the spread of
the virus
and uh you know one of the one of the
things i know we've talked about is that
the beneficial
one of the benefits potential benefits
of proceeding with sports
is that the athletes coaches and
families
have that extra incentive have that
extra incentive to make sure that off
the playing field they're
doing the right things like wearing
their masks and
staying socially distanced and stopping
the spread of the virus and
we hope that this announcement will
represent
hundreds of thousands of people who have
an extra incentive
to get this right and as the governor
mentioned the coaches
have an expanded role as educators and
leaders
in this particular year
i also want to mention that
everyone involved must be accountable
in addition to the health department the
ohio high school athletic association
will hold schools
athletes and parents accountable they
will have site inspectors
at contests to ensure that the rules are
being followed
and that the failure to comply with
these rules can result in forfeits of
athletic contests and
disqualification from competition for
the season so
uh the the accountability and the nature
of how we're taking this seriously
is super important so uh when it comes
uh
to the coronavirus we know that there is
uh
no right decision uh and that risk
tolerance and your own personal
circumstances and your limited
alternatives are
are important uh in any of that decision
making and
and as dr borchers and the governor
pointed out you know
go into this with your eyes wide open
know what you have to do
know what uh the circumstances are for
you and your family but for the athletes
out
out there here's your chance to play
sports the sports you love
and the opportunity to show us that you
possess the discipline to make it work
and we all want you to be successful and
healthy
and we're excited for the opportunity
that you have to to do this the right
way
governor thanks john uh we're ready for
questions
governor your first question today is
from ben schwartz at wcpo in cincinnati
hi ben hi governor thank you for
sticking with us through the
difficulties
um my question though i'd like to touch
on kind of how you ended
your last statement about um how tough
this decision
is um i'd like to know how tough the
entire decision process has been for you
and
how hard it was for you to come to this
conclusion regarding sports in the state
and to know if we can expect any changes
to come in the future
if the situation regarding coven 19
changes
specifically regarding uh spectators at
events
well ben yes it's obviously been a been
a difficult decision
and it's difficult decision because we
you know
this is what we value the most uh we
value all lives
uh but we take special care of our kids
and uh you know i think this could be
one of my children out there
playing so friend i have eight kids we
have 24 grandchildren uh you know they
all have played sports at one
one level or the other so we know the
importance of sports we know
how much that season can mean to that
young
person but we also know that look we're
in a critical time in ohio uh you know
our positivity rate has come down below
five
that's good but we also know that we
have some
places where uh that positivity is
triple that
uh in in ohio in some counties uh and
that's
that's of grave grave concern so
what we wanted to do today is to lay out
much
facts as we could we wanted to we've
been working on these
these orders that give guidance and we
would just ask
everyone involved to please read them
because it gives you the guidance to how
we think is the best way to to carry
to carry this out
but these decisions are not made in a
vacuum
it's not just a case of saying okay look
we're going back to school
that's a risk we know that uh we're
playing sports we know that's a risk
that both of those have certainly have
the potential to increase the
spread in the in the community so we you
know
but we also know as i said these
decisions are not made in a vacuum
and you know that child having the
discipline of that sports
having a coach who says look we got to
get this right
men and women we got to do this not just
today at practice not just in the game
coming up
but what you do the rest of the day and
that discipline
uh that desire to have a season
i think uh you know certainly has the
potential
to more than compensate for the added
danger that is there i've also had
parents
who have reached out to me a lot of
parents have reached out to me
and talked about frankly on both sides
of this and talked about mental health
issues
and you know we all know young people
who
sports is what excites them
and that gives them a purpose and it
gives them
a reason to continue to study
and continue to stay focused
so a lot a lot of good things comes out
out of sports
to answer your last question we're going
to see how it goes
we're going to see how it goes going
back to school in person is a risk
but we also know we want our kids back
in school
we want our kids to play sports but we
also know playing sports is a risk
and we're going to have to see how this
goes and so if it doesn't work
if it doesn't work schools are going to
know that pretty quick
the coaches are going to know that
pretty quick we would just ask them to
work with their local health department
very closely
and to make the make the right decisions
we obviously will be looking at this
and we'll see how this how this works
and we hope it works
next question is from steve albritton at
wlwt
in cincinnati hey governor thanks so
much for doing this a two-part question
for you
um one was a mask mandate ever
considered i know at least for football
athletes when it cools off
most if not all of them would throw
something over their face to keep that
cool air
coming into their lungs and also on the
second part um
in this in this order is there anything
with liability for schools is there a
parental release form anything like that
that will be required for athletes to
play
thank you uh yeah two good questions uh
as far as the mask we've left that open
so far
we're gonna see how it works we've left
it open to
the schools the coaches who are
monitoring that
and know what's going on um doesn't mean
that
in that area or other areas that we
can't fine-tune things
if it looks like we need to fine-tune it
we will not hesitate to fine-tune if we
if we think that will help um second as
far as liability
uh this is something that i talked
yesterday liability bill excuse me
uh to the speaker and the senate
president
and i know that they both have bills
moving forward
and so i would hope that there would be
some liability bill
that would would pass and that we could
get to my desk
next question is from jack windsor at
wmfd
in mansfield hi governor hey jack i
missed you
we missed you too sir
uh tough question governor we know that
cobit was
in ohio in january according to data and
in one county
they're claiming it was in november and
since this is highly contagious it
probably did spread massively
without our knowing and at one point in
february before any policies we saw
hospitalization
admissions uh reached i think 1200 in a
day
and the worst we've seen since then
knowing that covet is here is about 700.
we also know that many schools were
closed with a flu-like virus last winter
and many ohioans believe that this was
clovid
yet we had a winter season and we didn't
seem to see serious issues with high
school athletes nor
do we see hospitals overcrowded with
athletes their parents or grandparents
now that we have more immunity better
diagnostic measures
ways to treat covet successfully without
a vaccine and even
the heart condition that dr butchers
mentioned is very rare
according to him given all this data um
it shows like the virus is under control
when you look at the are not
the positivity rate uh case trajectory
and everything
so the tough question is why are we
restricting our kids at all
when we could give them a season free of
restrictions particularly when the cdc
already warned that suicide drug abuse
depression those are much greater issues
than coveted with our kids and that they
are not
transmitting the virus to adults when
you combine this information why can't
we give them a season without
restrictions
well i guess jack i don't agree i
honestly don't agree with everything
you've said
so i'd say so when you start with
different facts i guess you end up with
different conclusions
you know first of all we're seeing
significant spread into rural areas we
never we did not see that before in the
spring
you could live in a rural area in the
spring and not have not know anybody
that had covet
pretty hard to do uh today we've seen it
just spread and if you go up the western
side of the state you see very rural
counties
wonderful people great counties and
they've got horrible spread
uh that's that's one uh two if you look
at
you know you've referenced several times
about you know how many people have
really had it
i think one good way of looking at is
looking at the red cross numbers uh
and you know when somebody goes in to
give blood
not a perfectly sample i suppose but it
does give
some idea because these are people who
don't have any symptoms uh and
and you know they try to determine one
of things they determine is whether or
not they've had covet or not
uh that number has never been been very
very high it's always been
fairly low and frank and interestingly
it's pretty much tracking the last
number i saw is tracking the national
average so it's one or two percent uh i
can't remember exactly
where it came where it came out um and
so
look we can have a season uh we can have
seasons uh
we can have a lot of things uh but
if covet gets into a team it's not gonna
work
uh and so we're just asking everyone to
be careful
uh if you look at you know how we
conduct our lives today in ohio
you know we can do most everything uh we
just got to be careful
uh there's just an added sense of
self-discipline and trying to be careful
and since we're talking about sports and
talking about hope
uh there is hope out there because this
we're gonna get through this
we're gonna get through this it will be
over it will be in our rear view mirror
and we'll look back on it and talk about
it and
and young people will tell their kids
and their grandkids about it
but it will be over and we will be
moving forward but my goal for every
ohioan is to be there
when that happens to make it make sure
your grandmother doesn't get sick
make sure that she can make it make sure
everybody else makes it
uh and finally kids do spread it uh
you know every study has shown uh that
kids do spread it
so particularly those 10 years of age or
older
most of these athletes were talking
about
one of the concerns is they may be fine
um
but do they take it home to somebody in
their family who has a
uh added added medical problem so those
those are the concerns that we would
have thanks jack
governor next question is from danny
eldridge at hannah news service
hello governor sorry about that i was on
mute um
we talked about sports um i guess
another another thing that uh
you know may need to be addressed is uh
the performing arts uh for high school
students and
for the professionals out there who feel
like they you know
are kind of been left in the dark during
during these reopenings um do you have a
can you talk about what plans you have
for
not only uh the professional performing
arts you know and
look and we probably we apologize for
that in regard to the performing arts
uh you know we've had grandchildren uh
who have been in
in school plays and theater and it is uh
something that's just very very very
important uh and it's
uh one of the more amazing things is to
you know see your grandchild up there
with a role in a play and just
how in the world they memorize the lines
and do all the things and the songs and
everything else so
we don't want to leave that behind so
we'll have orders out this week that
will cover that
what we do know is is what the
scientists tell us
and obviously people project and so
that's going to have to be taken care of
somehow
if that may mean moving moving the
audience back further
so there's not that projection uh you
know we're gonna leave that
we're working with the scientists on
that to come up with some sort of plan
for that but we do
don't mean to leave out the performing
arts
very very very important and uh you know
not only is important to
to those who perform but uh for those of
us who can't perform
uh but sit there in the audience and uh
get great joy out of it uh
you know we're always amazed at what
these these actors
actresses and what these performers can
do so
we'll have something next couple days
next question is from laura bischoff at
the dayton daily news
uh hi governor um two quick questions
will teams be following the cdc
guidelines for quarantine
um of their close contacts when they
have a positive or will they be looking
at a shorter period
and also will there be schools where
students are online only yet
after school hours they're out on the
football field or on the cross-country
course
uh competing yeah the answer to the
second question
laura is that's entirely up to the
school and to the families
we have seen you know we've left the
decision uh
about going back to school in person
or a hybrid split or
you know totally online that's up to the
school
also up to the school is the sports
so you could have a combination of being
online and that school made the decision
but we want to play ball they make and
they can do that and so
i think you look at today's announcement
it's just
really kind of following up and
consistent with with that
um you know after consultation with the
ohio
high school athletic association we have
additional option
which is that you know for a contact
sport if the school wants to move it and
they can they can
you know put up come up with a schedule
uh we saw a number of of uh county uh
schools
uh wanting to do that in fact i talked
with john i talked with the pharma
superintendent this morning
uh you know about their ideas of putting
different things together we're fine
we're fine with that we just want to
give them
more more options uh as far as the cdc
yes they've been following the cdc
uh guidelines and uh you know this is
this is where it will be very very
important for them to work with their
with their local health departments so
um you know again in counties or
or in school districts where the spread
is
significant very very significant or
high
that's going to be more difficult it's
just you know
they swim in the ocean of whatever is
out there
and so that's going to make it more
difficult doesn't mean it's impossible
but it's going to make it
certainly certainly more difficult but
again
you know we're going to follow the best
practices
that we follow anywhere else
thank you thank you next question is
from scott house with the xenia daily
gazette
governor how are you doing good good
thanks for uh thanks for hanging in
there with us all
um with with fall sports contact sports
there's a lot of moving parts
into putting out an event how detailed
are the orders going to be
with respect to the number of people
football game
concession stands number of people
allowed in the press box how they set
things up for socials distancing
is that going to be yours
[Music]
yeah yes scott i mean it's it's going to
be a combination of both us what we put
out in the order
and the guidance we had but it's all
look it's like it's like anything else
in life it's execution you know
and the folks who are going to have to
execute it i mean one of the things that
we
provide is that everybody who's hosting
an event
uh let's say it's uh you know cedarville
high school
uh you know they're gonna have to have
what we call a compliance person they're
gonna have to designate someone on
you know on staff who is the compliance
person who makes sure that
you know everything is in fact being
followed we give them some guidance
uh in regard to the stands uh you know
it's kind of basic goes back to uh
separation of people family members will
be able to be seated
by themselves you come out of a
household you obviously can sit
we'll be able to sit together but what
we don't want
is people from other households
you know close in so we want to separate
people out
we will have a we will have a cap uh but
the focus really will be on
parents um and you know and
we'll let the schools work this out
we're not going to tell them how to do
it but
but the focus has been really clear of
what people have told
me that is hey let's have the kids play
it's most important thing
second most important thing is have
their loved ones there to cheer them on
somebody who makes a difference in that
child's life so that's that's what our
emphasis is i think when you you
look at the order uh you'll see that and
so
it's not going to be your typical friday
night football in ohio i mean
you know it it friday night football is
where the
community comes together literally uh
and you see people that you know didn't
see all week but you're gonna see them
friday night
and you know get your popcorn you watch
the football game and
it's just not gonna be like that uh and
we hope it's only you know it's one
season uh but
but the young people are going to get to
play and that we think is the most
important thing
next question is from kevin landers at
wbns in columbus
good afternoon governor kevin i wanted
to switch
topics a little bit i wanted to talk
about voting does one dropbox per 1
million people
make any sense to you and if so can you
explain why and also do you support the
president's
decision to begin making reforms to the
postal service so close to an election
well no president didn't consult me on
that
um look i i think there's a real
consensus
among republicans and democrats that
um you know there are certainly
challenges with the post office
but um you know we don't want in any way
have a situation where the post office
does not have the resources they need
to get the ballots out get the ballots
back
uh so you know one thing that franklin
rose
uh always reminds everybody and i'm
going to let john houston say something
or ask john if he wants to say something
because he was former secretary of state
but you know people can apply
early send in your letter asking for
that
application and then my understanding is
when the magical date comes they can
send that right to you
and you'll get it early get it back um
and i think that is that is important
john you want to add anything
to kevin's sure to my answer to kevin's
question
uh look the post office needs to have
adequate personnel
staffing and and machinery to do its job
the system that we are operating in in
ohio has worked very well for more than
a decade
in many cases they there were never drop
boxes
uh everybody get your absentee ballot
applications in
the ballots will be sent to you a month
in advance before the election
get them back out mail them in you can
track that ballot online
all the way back to your board of
elections to make sure that it was
received and will be counted
so we have the tracking mechanisms we
have the infrastructure in place
the post office needs to do its job ohio
system has worked
that system is not changing we need the
post office to execute and it'll work
it'll work out fine
voters should not be worried about their
ballots
being counted or being uh sent through
the mail
as long as they turn them in on time uh
if it's postmarked
in advance uh of elect of of the day
before or
of election day it will be counted so
make sure that i just i want to have a
reassuring message in here
ohio it's worked in ohio in the past
we're not doing anything differently
for the most part and so it will it will
work again
thanks john who's next
next question is from andy chow at ohio
public radio and television
hi governor i'm wondering if i could try
to squeeze two questions and one
as far as high school sports go will
athletes be required to be tested before
games
and then as far as this decision goes
how important have the past couple of
weeks of declining numbers how
did those play a role in your decision
today
uh yes to the second question
uh look uh we still are seeing mixed
numbers
uh but positivity has now reached as i
recall
4.5 that is down two full points from
where it was probably two months ago
uh now that is statewide it doesn't mean
that we don't have places
where it is high and those are the
places as i've made very clear that i
worry most about
and just a little pitch for sports and
for our
athletes the most important thing you
can do if you live in a
area that's red or if you live in an
area that is orange or really any place
in ohio if you want your kids to play
football if you want them to
participate in soccer and whatever the
the sport is
the most important thing you can do is
wear a mask be careful
because the community spread is going to
be directly reflected
uh in into into that school so yeah that
played a big
uh a big part as far as testing uh there
i know there was confusion we had a
previous
two orders ago and then the last order
was just repeated it was never our
intent that the testing requirement
would be for students now if school has
the ability to test
that would be good but we're not you
know we don't assume that
in fact we're assuming that testing is
not going to be that widespread unless
someone has a symptom but we're willing
we're certainly willing to work with the
schools on this
the other thing annie that's going on as
you well know
is this testing situation is changing
it's changing very quickly
we have started for example testing
of all our you heard earlier about our
testing that we have going on
in the veterans home but we're going
through now
and actually it's being done uh in
assisted living homes
uh in residences uh you know we're on a
two
two week cycle of testing uh and that
testing is taking
taking place so the testing is more and
more opportunities
uh we have uh some opportunities to
bring in more testing and we're going to
continue to do that so
where we are in a month from now or
where we are two months from now
i can't tell you but today it's pretty
clear
that it would be a very unusual high
school that would have the ability
to do any kind of testing uh you know
regularly
to do testing it just so that's not part
of this order
it's not part of our working assumption
it's not ba
you know it's not what we base this
decision on
thank you next question is from jeff
redick at wsyx in columbus
hello governor hi jeff
um i know you said that this applies to
high school sports and youth sports does
your order also apply to college sports
of all kinds um
if so i know there's a lot of
consternation about what's going on at
ohio state with the cancellation of big
ten season
um did you know anything about their
testing program and would you set your
foot in the waters of people who are
trying to get those sports
started again this fall uh what i've
learned about ohio state's testing
program frankly has come
after the fact as we were looking at
high school
this order is focused primarily
on high school but
you know it would certainly apply and
will apply
to college as well
you know this is a moving target as you
know some schools have
some leagues have decided not to play a
big ten of course
uh the mac uh so that knocked off uh you
know a number of
certainly division one schools uh in
ohio there's other leagues have decided
not to play so it's a
it's a it's a moving target but you know
this would apply
uh to those teams as well those schools
as well
next question is from uh jim province at
the toledo blade
hello governor this is a bit of a
follow-up to
jeff's question we've seen some of the
major
college football conferences including
the big ten postpone their football
seasons
because they don't think it's safe right
now for college athletes
we've seen some professional teams that
have been unable to keep the
virus out of the locker rooms etc why do
we think
it's going to be any different in a high
school
gymnasium or on the field
well jim that certainly gives us all
pause
you know these decisions you'd have to
talk to the different sports know
the leagues about why they made made
those decisions
i've never said this is going to be easy
we have provided opportunities
first it starts the family family can
say we're not playing
school can say we're not playing
school can then say if it wants to if we
don't want to do that i can say we're
going to play
we're going to try to play in the spring
but when you look at
i think you have to look at this from a
holistic
point of view and the
holistic point of view is what's best
for that individual
person that individual child that
individual
athlete and
all the things that go with sports
so if you only worried if you only
worried about
the hours in a day that that
student athlete would be in practice
or in a game pretty one-sided decision i
think
but we're dealing with a person and
we're dealing with what they do
the other times of the day
uh and we're gonna we're gonna see
but i am hopeful uh you know
whether the that desire that discipline
uh to succeed uh instilled by the coach
and self instilled by the athlete
uh will make them safer
or as safe as they would have been
if they were not playing the sport so
none of this we know it's all a
we hope educated guess we don't know
where the virus will be in the spring
we don't know really where the virus
will be in three weeks from now
um and you know we stand ready quite
candidly uh if this goes the wrong way
uh to shut it shut it all down
but i looked at this
as a very close call
and i listened
to what many parents have told me about
the problems connected
with their child being out of school
their child who
had major focus on sports that kept him
or her focused
kept them in school kept them focused on
getting good grades
kept them focused on a lot of things and
you pull that away and i've had
a lot of people describe for us and it's
not just the studies that have been done
about what impact that has on that
particular child
so it's not just a question of hey the
hours their play sports the hours they
you know is is that worth it the whole
the question is it's the it's a bigger
picture
and and frankly we're allowing parents
to make that decision
uh we're allowing schools to make that
decision
if it goes off the rails if it goes off
the rails
don't doubt that we'll we'll step in
john yeah
thanks governor a couple things just
really to emphasize
you know if you're talking about 16 year
olds 17 year olds high school athletes
they're they're in a position that
they're going to go out and compete
it just when you look at this and i know
from my life experiences in talking to
coaches
are they better with the incentive to
play and to keep themselves
protected 24 hours a day
under a coach's supervision in these
rules than they would be to be left to
their own devices and go out and play
pickup games and
do unorganized things as they do and i
you know i just think that they're going
to there's more of an incentive for them
to do this right
and to get the the education and
coaching that they need
to to sustain this uh under a more
structured situation and governor
one thing i don't know if we pointed out
is the effective
date of when this can occur and that
would be august the 21st
august the 21st would would be the the
effective date
for resumption of these activities
you know in a sense we're candidly we're
putting a lot on the coaches we're
putting
on the athletic directors and and
everybody in the school
but you know they're the ones who can
most directly uh impact this they're the
ones who
you know are there to inspire this
student athlete
every other day and a lot of it is
execution i mean there's you know
fran i've had uh i guess all our kids
have run cross country most of our uh
grandkids have run cross country they've
done other sports played soccer done
other things as well
uh but a lot of it's going to be in the
execution
uh you know if you've got a if you've
got a cross-country team and they're and
they're practicing i know
what kids like to do they're out running
a road or they're out running where in a
park or wherever they're running they
like to be bunched together that's what
they want to do
you can't do that now i mean you can't
be in a situation where
you know the one athlete is uh breathing
on the other one for uh you know 60
minutes or
longer so it's just things like that
that we can't write in orders we can't
micromanage
but that every coach is going to have to
figure out okay
it's not just during the event it's not
just during the meet not just during the
game
it's all the time i'm working with this
young person and they're in training
how are we going to do the training
everything has to has to be rethought
just like we
rethink everything else during this time
of coba
again next year we hope everybody's back
and we're back doing the things that
in the way we wanted to do them but this
is no ordinary time
this is a different time it will end but
during this time
all of us have to be different frankly
who has next question big zuckerman from
ohio capitol journalist next question
hello governor this is jake zuckerman
here uh
uh if the if the fda does authorize a
copic vaccine
to and brings it to the market they're
gonna be some questions to answer like
how does the vaccine get
out who gets it first and who if anyone
must get it
can you detail any planning on this
front and do you expect to
request any kind of legislation of this
alley from the ga
you know that's an excellent question i
i don't think frankly
we know one would assume uh that there
will be
protocols that will be national
protocols
uh but i'm we're talking to doctors now
uh in case that's there's not national
protocols
that are set you know how how would we
set that in
in ohio uh these are decisions that
politicians shouldn't make
bluntly these are decisions that we
should leave to
to infectious disease experts and people
who really understand
you know what is vitally important to
save the most lives
and how do we quickly or quick as we can
get control of this
so it's something that we're already
starting to talk with doctors about
if there's not national guidance we will
we will have we will be ready
do you expect to need help from the
legislature to rule anything out
well i don't know yet frankly i really
don't know yet
again again you know we have to see
where this discussion goes
and we'll try to do this
decision like we've done everything else
and that is to rely on doctors to rely
on medical community
uh and try to make the you know the most
informed informed decision but these are
not
typically uh politician decisions
elected officials we've got to bring the
people in
and who who can tell us you know the
health experts
how can we save the most lives how can
we slow the spread the quickest
governor next question is the last
question and it belongs to jackie
borchardt of the cincinnati enquirer
hey jackie hey how are you um this this
plan today leaves a lot of decisions
to local schools does the order give
them any guidance such as
specific metrics or benchmarks uh about
how to reach that decision
and what would you consider going off
the rails to look like
well that's a good question um i think
when you see the order
you'll see you'll see there's a lot of
guidance in there
it would be great to see the order but
not yeah you'll get to see that tomorrow
i think i don't think it's quite done
but uh but as far as the decision
look jackie we've
i we're not very we haven't been too
subtle about this i mean
you know if you're in a community where
you've got widespread covenant spread
you've got to think long and hard about
having contact sports in the fall
i mean we're not going to tell them not
to do it but you know that is part of
the process
whatever it is in the community it will
be in your school and whatever it is in
your school will be
you know at least going in with those
athletes
no reason to think it's going to be any
any different so that's why
we continue to talk about the importance
of schools
communities rather uh you know if they
want their kids back in school
then wear the mask cut this spread down
keep it keep the distance so you know as
the as doctors butcher said schools
and athletes and teams you know have got
to look at
what the environment is that they exist
in
i think i would also frankly look at who
are the teams i'm going to play
how's the spread in with those teams in
from that community that we're going to
be intermixing with
for several hours i would look i would
look at that
i think that is is certainly very
important uh as
as well so those are the you know
there's no secret about what the kind of
the metrics are or
or how you go about making this decision
but ultimately every school is different
every child is different
and you got to try to tailor the answer
um
for that child i would just also say and
ask
our schools our coaches uh we'll get a
chance john i'm gonna have a chance to
talk
with them and the superintendents here
shortly um
as well as athletic directors but look
be flexible be flexible
you know make this work if it doesn't
work
it doesn't work pull back uh you know if
you're not too far in the season maybe
you can flip over to the
you know you'll want to make a decision
to flip over and do it try to do it in
in the spring
you we just we've just got to be
flexible because we're dealing with so
many things that are unknown i mean
you know our our positivity rate is down
but it's not down in every county it's
up it's up in a lot of counties
overall statewide it's down but a lot of
particular rural counties
we're seeing it we're seeing it go go up
so
i see that my time is up uh thank you
all very very much we'll see you
back here i believe at two o'clock on
thursday
and hope everybody has a good day thank
you
