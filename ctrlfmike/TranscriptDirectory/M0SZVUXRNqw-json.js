    "the medical experts tell us that it's",

    "for example if you drive an hour to a",
    "state park with your family",
    "you're together you go out and you hike",
    "uh you enjoy the great outdoors",
    "that's one thing that's pretty benign",

    "no one wears a mask even though that's",

    "going to that going to that state park",
    "even though you drove an hour so it's",
    "not",
    "just about you know how far you go uh",
    "it's really about what you do what we",

    "i want to show a chart one of the things",

    "this chart shows the weekly",
    "data from march through the end of",
    "august and it features",
    "age groups among ohioans age zero to 29.",
    "so as you look at this this is not this",
    "is not everybody",
    "this is zero zero to zero to twenty nine",
    "and so you start at the bottom with zero",
    "to four uh",
    "next color up uh you're five to ten",
    "years of age then eleven to thirteen and",
    "fourteen is seventeen",
    "uh and then you get up uh into",
    "what i would call orange of sorts orange",
    "yellow i guess",
    "and that's that is 18 to 22.",
    "and so this is you know the truly",
    "remarkable numbers and again",
    "universities are back",
    "a lot of our universities are doing",
    "frankly a very good job in testing",
    "and because of that you're seeing",
    "35 percent of the cases this past",
    "week 35 percent of the cases",
    "of those tested positive were in that",
    "very fine",
    "age group of 18 to 22. so just in",
    "just an interesting chart as we move",
    "forward and to",
    "our friends in college um you know again",
    "we ask you",
    "to be careful because um",
    "while all of us when we were your age",
    "thought we were invincible",
    "you can pass this on you can get it and",

    "is the danger that's passed on to",
    "someone",
    "who is older someone who has a medical a",
    "medical problem",
    "and we have seen uh where those 18 to 22",
    "have in fact",
    "uh certainly have gotten sick um",
    "we know that uh your odds",
    "mortality is much much better odds",
    "obviously the younger the younger you",
    "are",
    "so while many of these college students",
    "certainly may not get seriously sick",
    "uh what we are concerned about is is the",
    "spread and we'll talk a little bit more",
    "about that uh with miami's president",
    "uh eric let's go to the kind of the key",
    "indicators today",
    "um",
    "1345 cases and 50 deaths",
    "uh so not certainly uh not",
    "good it's consistent uh with what we've",

    "top",
    "88 counties and as you recall we",
    "have started doing this a few weeks ago",
    "really just trying to",
    "do the snapshot of two weeks to see how",
    "many cases each county had and then we",
    "uh equalize that out by putting it per",
    "100",
    "000 population so we",
    "will see those counties let's go eric to",
    "the 10 if we could",
    "and you'll see putnam county and then",
    "montgomery county",
    "meigs county butler county jackson dark",

    "let me kind of go through through these",
    "for a moment",
    "um so let's go let's eric let's go to",
    "the map now",
    "so this is the new map uh 67 of our",

    "counties moving down from",
    "orange to yellow we'd like to see that",
    "we now have 39 yellow counties the",
    "highest number we've had since july 2nd",

    "in lorraine local health department",
    "officials tell us",
    "that more residents are following the",

    "on august 24th now to 46.3",
    "visits per day we are seeing of course",
    "some of this is being",
    "driven by what's going on at the",
    "university of dayton",

    "mitigate the spread local health",

    "do for all of us and we are sending our",
    "best wishes from oxford to our first",
    "lady fran",
    "but let me start off by saying a few",
    "things about our gratitude",
    "and what we're doing in collaborating",
    "with chancellor randy gardner",
    "of the ohio department of higher ed and",
    "with the presidents of our state",
    "institutions with the inter university",
    "council of ohio",
    "and its president bruce johnson through",
    "our collaborative efforts with our",
    "public university colleagues",
    "a return to campus plan was created with",
    "broad input",
    "across all the universities that",
    "included 24 categories with baseline",
    "health protocols",
    "these protocols included some most",
    "recent science information and practices",
    "and at miami we incorporated all these",
    "into our healthy together plan",
    "for our reopening strategy we work",
    "collaboratively",
    "and frequently with our health",
    "commissioner jenny baylor and her",
    "dedicated staff",
    "at the butler county general health",
    "district our partners at tri health",
    "and the city of oxford to implement our",
    "institutional plan",
    "and to help protect our university",
    "community and the residents of northwest",
    "butler county",
    "well we began this semester with the",
    "vast majority of our undergraduate",
    "students",
    "being taught remotely our first and",
    "second year students",
    "are not scheduled to begin moving in to",
    "the residence halls until september 14th",
    "and then in-person classes and hybrid",
    "classes will begin on september 21st",
    "that being said we currently have a",
    "significant",
    "number of students living off campus in",
    "the oxford community",
    "and even though our first and second",
    "year students have not returned to",
    "campus yet",
    "we have seen a spike in coveted cases",
    "among our students living off campus",
    "we now report 704 positive coveted cases",
    "and we are thankful there's no",
    "hospitalizations",
    "but in the short time frame this surge",
    "of cases really demonstrates",
    "the aggressive nature of this virus",
    "and in response to this spike and",
    "working together with all of our",
    "partners",
    "we have increased our testing strategies",
    "and have taken other actions",
    "testing broadly is so important here in",
    "partnership with our tri-health health",
    "provider",
    "we have the capacity to test now over",
    "3000 individuals each week",
    "through wide net and surveillance",
    "testing this is in addition to",
    "diagnostic testing of persons",
    "who are presenting symptoms these two",
    "approaches help identify",
    "asymptomatic individuals who are",
    "positive or potential clusters",
    "of positive cases the wide net strategy",
    "allows us to test individuals who have",
    "been potentially",
    "exposed to the virus but perhaps not",
    "have been",
    "identified as a closed contract through",
    "the tracing processes",
    "and on the surveillance side testing",
    "identifies a sample of individuals for",
    "testing",
    "even though they are not symptomatic or",
    "identified as having close contact",
    "with a positive individual so we are",
    "also investing in a technology that can",
    "provide test results",
    "within 15 to 20 minutes and once",
    "operational it will further enhance and",
    "advance our testing strategies here in",
    "oxford",
    "and in addition to all this testing that",
    "we're doing we're also aggressively",
    "applying other strategies to flatten the",
    "curb",
    "and reverse our trend first we are",
    "grateful to butler county health",
    "district",
    "for aggregating all of our tests from",
    "all testing sites",
    "so not just our health care partners but",
    "also to have a more complete count of",
    "positive cases",
    "across all of our students that's very",
    "important second",
    "butler county health district has has",
    "also hired",
    "many more contact tracers miami provided",
    "80 of those",
    "15 more came from the ohio department of",
    "health and more are being trained",
    "and contact tracers really enable us to",
    "more quickly quarantine and isolate",
    "students",
    "to help slow the spread of the virus and",
    "then in conjunction with advice of the",
    "butler county health commissioner",
    "we are emphasizing the importance of",
    "staying home this labor day weekend",
    "and as you have pointed out govern",
    "hunkering down this weekend",
    "will greatly minimize the potential for",
    "further spread of the virus",
    "we continue to educate our community on",
    "the importance of wearing face coverings",
    "maintaining physical distancing",
    "practicing good hand hygiene",
    "and limiting gatherings to 10 or fewer",
    "people",
    "and our city of oxford has passed",
    "aggressive ordinances around math",
    "squaring",
    "and gathering size and the city of",
    "oxford has also launched a great video",
    "including miamians on their healthy",
    "campaign",
    "engaging all these strategies",
    "consistently",
    "we can help reduce the spread of covet",
    "in our community",
    "we are working very hard to flatten the",
    "curve and turn over our current",
    "and very concerning upward trend and our",
    "greatest concern",
    "is the health of our students faculty",
    "staff and community members",
    "and we are doing everything we can to",
    "ensure that we are all healthy together",
    "i want to thank you governor for this",
    "opportunity to share this update",
    "with the great state of ohio thank you",
    "well dr crawford",
    "you know fran and i have a grandson",
    "who is first year and granddaughter",
    "who's second year",

    "so our move-in date is scheduled for",
    "september 14th",

    "metrics carefully",
    "over the labor day weekend and then",
    "we'll actually",
    "let everybody know in the miami",
    "community no later the next wednesday",
    "on how we're doing where we sit and how",
    "we move forward together",
    "mr president i notice i'm looking at a",
    "release from",
    "butler county health department one of",
    "the things i kind of underline here",
    "urging members of the community to be",
    "responsible avoid parties large",
    "gatherings",
    "noting that the state of ohio saw an",
    "increase in cases following memorial day",
    "holiday weekend",
    "and then talks about staying staying put",
    "which i guess is",
    "is your your message and i know you've",
    "been communicating a lot",
    "to directly to to your students um",
    "kind of two-part question uh one",
    "what do you attribute the spread on",
    "campus",
    "to or off campus it's in oxford at least",
    "and what's your message to miami",
    "students",
    "yes so early on when students started",
    "moving back to oxford even though we",
    "started online and remote",
    "upperclassmen moved back and those early",
    "weekends in august we saw",
    "an uptick in parties and gatherings and",
    "so i think that's the responsible",
    "that's what's responsible for the surge",
    "today and",
    "so our message to students is we put a",
    "lot of protocols in place",
    "uh to keep everybody safe and healthy",
    "and now",

    "does not mean the school did anything",
    "wrong in fact that there are cases they",
    "are reporting them they're doing what",
    "they should be doing",
    "they may have done absolutely everything",
    "possible to prevent the spread within",
    "their buildings",
    "but schools cannot control what happens",
    "out in the local community",
    "and what happens in the local community",
    "as far as the spread will be reflected",
    "in that school",
    "let me go now to the lieutenant",
    "governor john",
    "thanks governor i want to give a quick",

    "manufacturing",

    "attractiveness rating i should say",
    "we got high scores for our tax policy",

    "attempt to seek grants for to help",
    "manufacturers",
    "uh invest in modernizing their",
    "manufacturing process",
    "and also upskilling their workforce so",

    "juncture that your chief",
    "concern in your decision making is the",
    "safety of the people of ohio",
    "so given everything you know about",
    "coronavirus would you",
    "or your health department advice people",
    "take a vaccine",
    "that's not been fully tested in",
    "accordance to generally accepted",
    "protocols",
    "well this is not out yet",
    "we do not have all the information i",
    "have",
    "the same information really that most",
    "ohioans do",
    "about this so we're waiting uh",
    "and you know what frankly what we need",
    "to do what ohioans need to do is to",
    "listen to medical experts",
    "uh when this vaccine comes out you know",
    "i am sure that they will not bring this",
    "vaccine out",
    "and make it available to the public",
    "unless",
    "enough testing has been done but every",
    "ohioan will be able to",
    "watch the news and see as this",
    "progresses over the next few weeks",
    "look we're on a hurry to get a vaccine",
    "but we all",
    "also want it to be right uh",
    "and so ohioans will have the opportunity",
    "to to watch the news",
    "they'll have the opportunity to listen",
    "to what the white house says",
    "they have the opportunity to listen what",
    "medical experts say",
    "uh as this vaccine comes on the market",
    "so we in ohio",
    "are doing what we can do and what we can",
    "do is get ready",
    "for whatever that day is uh it can't",
    "come soon enough but we",
    "obviously want it done right but",
    "whenever that day comes",
    "we will be ready so we have already",
    "started working",
    "pulling people together figuring out how",
    "we would distribute it",
    "and looking at priorities of how it",
    "should be distributed",
    "so that's something that we would you",
    "know imagine that the federal government",
    "will give us guidance on but we",
    "also are looking at the same thing",
    "ourselves so we're getting ready we're",
    "doing what we can do",
    "we're ready to go next",
    "question is from jack windsor at wmfd in",
    "mansfield",
    "hey jack hi governor uh",
    "the order released on august 31st and",
    "signed by",
    "lance hines as a second amended order",
    "for non-congregate sheltering",
    "to be used throughout ohio the order",
    "states that fema sheltering will be",
    "utilized throughout the state for those",
    "who are unable to safely",
    "self-quarantine at home governor who",
    "decides",
    "whether a resident is safe for self",
    "quarantine what are the determinants",
    "does this apply to the entire ohio",
    "population",
    "and what authority do you have to remove",
    "people from their homes",
    "i think that primarily jack that's going",
    "to be determined uh",
    "by individuals who think they're not",
    "safe at home",
    "uh i'll you know i'll get more",
    "information on that and",
    "i'll report back but that would be my",
    "take on it",
    "next question is from kevin landers at",
    "wbns",
    "in columbus",
    "hey kevin",
    "i think we might be having some typical",
    "kevin so we will move to",
    "since they inquire",
    "uh good afternoon uh governor how",
    "how much should uh kind of the",
    "university student spread that we're",
    "seeing",
    "uh concern other others in the rest of",
    "the city or county",
    "uh surrounding campus should should",
    "outbreaks that you see for example",
    "affect whether",
    "cincinnati kids go to school",
    "well i think it certainly is always",
    "concerning when you see spread in any",
    "community",
    "you know there is some interplay",
    "obviously between uc students and",
    "and uh cincinnati residents there's some",
    "interplay between oxford residents and",
    "miami and",
    "university of dayton and dayton uh and",
    "or any other",
    "university so sure it is something that",
    "should be",
    "uh concerning uh you know i think",
    "you know if i was a resident my uh",
    "concern would be focused on is the",
    "university on this are they on top of it",
    "are they doing the testing are they",
    "doing the quarantine are they doing what",
    "what they need to do",
    "but sure it's it it certainly is is",
    "concerning and should be",
    "some somewhat concerning",
    "we're still having uh issues with kevin",
    "so we'll go to jim addy at whio in",
    "dayton",
    "governor i want to go back to the",
    "vaccine question do you have in your",
    "mind's eye",
    "a system for distribution of these",
    "vaccines who decides",
    "where they go when they go what is the",
    "order of",
    "prioritization of this where do you",
    "begin in",
    "determining what the setting will be",
    "will this be through the hospital",
    "systems",
    "or will it be more general in other",
    "words urgent cares",
    "fire stations local health departments",
    "setting up",
    "their own systems how might this work",
    "jim probably all of the above i mean",
    "you've outlined",
    "uh the logical places for it to go but",
    "we don't have any announcement on that",
    "yet the team is working on that trying",
    "to figure out exactly where that",
    "you know where that should be and again",
    "we're sure that we're going to get",
    "guidance from the federal government on",
    "that but we",
    "don't want to wait for that we want to",
    "move ahead and have have our plan",
    "you know in in in place as far as",
    "priorities",
    "again we're going to see what the",
    "guidance comes bound from the federal",
    "government",
    "but uh you know we're looking uh at",
    "setting the priorities we're going to",
    "rely on",
    "on doctors and health experts uh",
    "but you know two groups of people that",
    "you you would",
    "assume are going to be early on uh are",
    "those who are most at risk",
    "uh which would be older people uh people",
    "uh certainly in nursing homes uh but we",
    "also would not want to forget our first",
    "responders who are out there",
    "uh every day and people who are in the",
    "front line uh so those would be two kind",
    "of big",
    "groups uh that i think you would be",
    "looking at as",
    "likely uh to start this off with",
    "but again we don't have anything to",
    "announce yet uh we don't know when this",
    "is coming",
    "but our job is to is to get ready and to",
    "try to",
    "come up with what we think are the or",
    "the best best practices",
    "when your goal is going to be you know",
    "twofold saving lives",
    "uh and cutting off the spread and you",
    "know those are those are two",
    "two main goals i think you would have uh",
    "in any kind of determination about where",
    "a vaccine would go",
    "the next question is from andrew welsh",
    "huggins of the associated press",
    "hi governor um thanks for doing this as",
    "always",
    "um we saw today that um initial claims",
    "for",
    "unemployment um well far below the",
    "record highs back in april they've",
    "stagnated at about 19 000 a week",
    "continuing unemployment claims are",
    "slowly inching down but they're still at",
    "higher levels than the great recession",
    "so",
    "six months into the pandemic and after",
    "several federal stimulus infusions",
    "where do you stand on the need for even",
    "more",
    "federal stimulus dollars to help bolster",
    "ohio's economy and",
    "assist our unemployed workers and",
    "what conversations if any have you had",
    "with the state's congressional",
    "delegation",
    "you know in terms of passing additional",
    "federal relief",
    "yeah i mean we stay in touch with the",
    "congressional delegation we obviously",
    "have we have",
    "a washington office but i also do this",
    "by by phone talking to the two senators",
    "talking to the",
    "representatives um you know they email",
    "me with with ideas and thoughts",
    "uh as well but yes we need an additional",
    "bill",
    "uh i know that's going to get worked out",
    "i'm still optimistic that",
    "this gets worked out but yes",
    "we we certainly do look we've come back",
    "we've not come back as much obviously as",
    "we want to we want to continue to move",
    "forward",
    "again this is why it is so important to",
    "keep",
    "the virus down we're not going to we",
    "don't have a fire extinguisher to put it",
    "out put that fire out",
    "but if we can keep it tamped down that",
    "means that",
    "you know our businesses can can come",
    "come back",
    "so i don't know john if you want to",
    "anything to that you've been monitoring",
    "i know the unemployment",
    "uh number of things as we we all have",
    "but uh i don't if you want to add",
    "anything to that or not",
    "yeah thanks governor it's just a",
    "reminder that",
    "uh president trump did sign the",
    "executive order that made available",
    "three hundred dollars per employee",
    "uh that we will uh we are that we have",
    "federal approval for through fema",
    "and that that will go out to",
    "ohioans who are eligible uh in the",
    "coming weeks",
    "uh it will be retroactive to the date",
    "that they were eligible so",
    "so that will serve as both support for",
    "people who are in need and",
    "have a stimulus effect to some extent",
    "but as the governor mentioned you know",
    "they're they're bigger issues small",
    "business i mean we know",
    "our a lot of small businesses like",
    "restaurants and people like that are",
    "are struggling that that another round",
    "of ppp",
    "um funding is something that they they",
    "think that they need we know that",
    "some funding for our first responders",
    "and people like that",
    "with local budgets that are being",
    "strained all of those things are",
    "important things to consider and and we",
    "have been actively engaged and we know",
    "our congressional delegation isn't",
    "engaged at making sure that we're doing",
    "this and i might mention that",
    "that the the legislature yesterday took",
    "action on",
    "on passing uh another round of of of",
    "karzak dollars will be",
    "released to local governments so we're",
    "working on those things from our side",
    "and what we can do but we we do need",
    "the federal government to give us a",
    "thoughtful proposal that we can",
    "we can really target the things where we",
    "need it the most",
    "thank you next question is from jim",
    "province at the toledo blade",
    "hello governor thanks again for doing",
    "this um",
    "lawmakers this week sent you house bill",

    "will this bill meet that same fate you",
    "know",
    "i've not looked at the language i'm",
    "going to look at the language but i",

    "one",
    "we have never closed our churches we",
    "have no intention of",
    "closing our churches this is something",

    "um and so never had a thought about",
    "closing our churches",
    "uh the only thing we've really done and",
    "restrict in regard to",
    "churches is because we've seen outbreaks",
    "come out of churches",
    "uh is ask everyone to wear a mask when",
    "they go in",

    "keep that fire down so that business has",
    "a chance to",
    "to to grow and but we understand that",
    "there are still",
    "you know people who are who are hurting",
    "and who who are",
    "um you know not where they where they",
    "should be or where we would want them",
    "to be john you want to add anything to",
    "that",
    "you know the only thing that i would add",
    "to that governor is that",
    "uh you know through ohio means jobs and",
    "our local partners",
    "we're working to help people navigate",
    "who maybe have lost the job",
    "to to to find one of the i believe",
    "there's over 180 000 jobs now posted on",
    "ohio means jobs",
    "um most of those pay 50 000",
    "a year or more and so we're really",
    "working with our local partners",
    "to help people who've maybe been",
    "displaced in one particular industry",
    "find a job in another industry and to",
    "make sure that they have the support",
    "services",
    "and the job training to help make sure",
    "that they can get access because one of",
    "the things that's happened during the",
    "pandemic is it shifted the nature of of",
    "work",
    "in some cases where anybody for example",
    "that's in the hospitality industry",
    "that industry has been hit very hard",
    "while there are others",
    "that uh in for example in logistics",
    "in a lot of consumer services",
    "they're hiring and so we we need to help",
    "you know help folks navigate that shift",
    "and",
    "and there are a lot of resources",
    "available at ohio means jobs and",
    "we're going to be making some",
    "announcements soon that we'll we'll talk",
    "about even more enhanced efforts that",
    "we're going to make to try to help them",
    "get ahead in this economy",
    "thanks joe kevin landers submitted his",
    "question on writing due to his",
    "microphone issue",
    "kevin landers writes pcr tests are",
    "considered the gold standard",
    "but the new york times reports huge",
    "numbers of people",
    "who may be carrying insignificant",
    "amounts of the virus",
    "meaning most are considered not to be",
    "contagious but are testing positive",
    "are those people being added to the",
    "state's positive cases",
    "if so why and are you concerned that",
    "that statistic may be",
    "painting an inaccurate picture in the",
    "state of ohio",
    "well i don't know if it's painting an",
    "inaccurate picture but",
    "you know we continue uh to evolve in",
    "regard to testing",
    "uh you know we've never had enough",
    "testing we've fought for more testing",
    "we've doubled it we've tripled it",
    "but we're still not where we we need to",
    "be but",
    "what as we learn more and companies",
    "develop tests uh you know one of the",
    "things that we're",
    "we're seeing uh is exactly what kevin",
    "said",
    "and some articles have pointed out and",
    "some of the doctors that i've talked to",
    "in the last few weeks that you know a",
    "pcr test is the gold standard",
    "uh but some but it's so good",
    "that uh sometimes it is picking up you",
    "know a small amount",
    "of the virus load uh and",
    "long after that person is contagious so",
    "you're seeing coming on the market is",
    "quicker tests",
    "and you're seeing coming on tests that",
    "if you",
    "are testing more frequently",
    "you can do a better job at hitting when",
    "that person is",
    "is contagious i mean that's the ultimate",
    "goal here",
    "is to figure out when that person is",
    "contagious um",
    "and as some of these articles are",
    "pointed out and i've asked my",
    "team to to examine this and get me a",
    "report",
    "but some of the tests",
    "have the ability although sometimes",
    "they're not reported this way",
    "but they have the ability to tell the",
    "virus load",
    "and so as we refine this you know",
    "using those tests which will tell you",
    "where that virus load is",
    "and then being able to see if it is",
    "within the range of where the experts",
    "say that person is contagious",
    "is going to allow us to have",
    "fewer people who have to be quarantined",
    "and you're only going to be quarantined",
    "ultimately those people who",
    "are in fact contagious and only cover",
    "that period of time when they're",
    "contagious now that's aspirational",
    "that's where we want to be we're not",
    "there yet today",
    "but but the question is spot on",
    "and we are we are evolving the experts",
    "are evolving",
    "uh the free enterprise system is",
    "evolving and what they are",
    "producing but being able to to find out",
    "exactly that virus load",
    "and then make your determination based",
    "on that",
    "is going to give us a more accurate",
    "ability",
    "to get the results we want the results",
    "we want",
    "are separating that person",
    "during the time that they're contagious",
    "doesn't mean the pcr tests are not",
    "accurate",
    "they're highly accurate but sometimes",
    "they're not giving",
    "they're showing someone that is still",
    "have have",
    "has a virus or has cells but is not",
    "maybe still contagious so",
    "good question uh and we're moving moving",
    "in that direction",
    "next question is from jeff radick at",
    "wsyx",
    "in columbus i am",
    "wondering about the data for franklin",
    "county today",
    "on the public health advisory alert",
    "system",
    "we've remained in the orange uh even",
    "though cases per 100 000 have jumped",
    "way up above 100 we're now at 113.9",
    "cases per 100 000.",
    "previously uh it was my understanding",
    "that if we jumped above 100 we flagged",
    "on the cdc level and that flagged us",
    "automatically to red",
    "is that longer the case has the maps",
    "guideline",
    "changed jeff i may be wrong about this",
    "and if i am someone will",
    "call john right away i'm sure uh and",
    "tell him we will correct it",
    "but my recollection is the way the",
    "system was set up",
    "was that you would have to be uh at that",
    "level",
    "above 100 100 or above for two straight",
    "weeks",
    "so i again i can be corrected on that",
    "and i'm sure",
    "someone will correct me quickly if i'm",
    "wrong but that's what i recall",
    "it would stand to say then that there's",
    "a warning here we're well above 100 if",
    "we stay",
    "oh yeah yeah look i mean look there's no",
    "there's",
    "no doubt about it and um you know i",
    "think the mayor's been very clear",
    "we're not out of the woods yet we've",
    "tried to be clear the health director",
    "uh both the city and the county have",
    "made that very very clear",
    "so um you know we're",
    "we still we still got to be a alert",
    "you know it's funny if i could just",
    "digress for a moment but",
    "i did interviews yesterday with i think",
    "seven different",
    "tv stations some of the reporters are uh",
    "have asked some questions today",
    "but i think almost in every tv station",
    "uh when i did",
    "uh an interview uh they said the most",
    "frequently asked question",
    "uh from their listeners their viewers",
    "was when can we take mask off",
    "i i just you know i had to kind of smile",
    "because we all want to take our mask off",
    "uh look i mean i",
    "we get we get hot no one wants to wear",
    "these things but",
    "we know we gotta we gotta do it uh and",
    "while we've made great progress this",
    "thing is not over it's not over till",
    "it's over",
    "and it's not over and we're gonna have",
    "to continue to",
    "do things like wearing masks and keeping",
    "social distance until",
    "we get through the tunnel until we see",
    "the light of day and",
    "again the goal i'm optimistic uh you",
    "know we're gonna make it through this",
    "and uh there's a bright future out there",
    "but we got to get through it",
    "and we've got to go put up with the",
    "annoyance",
    "uh of wearing a mask and the",
    "inconvenience of staying away from",
    "distance from people and doing the",
    "different things that were",
    "that we're doing but i think what you",
    "see what's happening in franklin county",
    "and",
    "you know some of the other counties uh",
    "each one's got a story but",
    "you know we're not through this and uh",
    "we're a long ways from being through it",
    "i mean a",
    "huge number of people died today or",
    "reported we got reports of their death",
    "today",
    "and you look at our cases they're",
    "they're not coming down",
    "so we got to hang in there and ohioans",
    "are tough and we'll",
    "we'll do it",
    "next question is from ben schwartz at",
    "wcpo",
    "in cincinnati hi governor",
    "um i'd like to ask about the planned",
    "soccer game between",
    "fc cincinnati and the columbus crew this",
    "weekend",
    "um the teams are planning on allowing",
    "just 1500 fans to spectate",
    "i'm wondering if you can tell us if this",
    "is allowed under the current health",
    "order",
    "and um with just 1500 fans it should be",
    "easy to socially distance but",
    "can you say whether or not fans will be",
    "required to wear masks during this",
    "entire game at least under your health",
    "order",
    "yeah i believe our health order um you",
    "know it it does",
    "it does allow 1500 uh spectators",
    "uh and you know they're they're",
    "basically",
    "uh as far as i can tell following health",
    "orders now they've got to work with the",
    "local health department obviously but",
    "um you know that was a general order",
    "that applies to any uh outdoor uh",
    "sporting event um so",
    "um you know they should be able to do",
    "that i mean the order i don't know the",
    "capacity i guess i'd have to figure out",
    "the capacity",
    "uh it's 15 or 1500 whichever is lower",
    "and that's what the order that's what",
    "the order says",
    "um there is a possibility as we go",
    "forward as i've mentioned before",
    "that when you look at other sports uh",
    "you know if",
    "if um they come with a plan",
    "uh that plan gets approved by the local",
    "health department that plan gets proved",
    "approved by the state health department",
    "you could see conceivably could see more",
    "more fans at soccer you could see more",
    "fans at",
    "nfl football game or baseball game or",
    "something else",
    "but that's the general the general order",
    "they would be trying i assume they're",
    "trying to come under the general the",
    "general order",
    "but against fifteen percent fifteen",
    "hundred whichever is less",
    "governor uh just an update on the last",
    "question",
    "uh regarding uh the franklin county 100",
    "100 cases per 100 000 number it's just a",
    "reminder",
    "to folks who may remember we know we",
    "have seven categories and you must hit",
    "at least",
    "four triggers before you go red",
    "regardless of where you are on the per",
    "capita",
    "number on the hundred thousand so",
    "franklin county does not hit those four",
    "triggers and that's",
    "that's why they're not red all right",
    "john john has uh",
    "got the got the truth there i i",
    "misstated it so uh",
    "i mean it it is that's that's what it is",
    "so",
    "sorry for uh being wrong about that",
    "it's it's hard to keep up with it all",
    "next question is from alex ebert at",
    "bloomberg",
    "good afternoon governor uh pretty simple",
    "question but",
    "pretty hard answer i'm sure how do we",
    "stop young adults from partying",
    "um you know the the college tradition of",
    "going out",
    "meeting your friends experimenting maybe",
    "a little bit",
    "and maybe getting into some bad but fun",
    "trouble",
    "how do we stop that so that we can stem",
    "the spread here thanks",
    "well it's certainly not something the",
    "governor can do",
    "to state the obvious you know",
    "what colleges have done uh they made",
    "pretty clear",
    "to students if the spread continues the",
    "spread goes up",
    "at some point you know we're going to",
    "have to go totally remote",
    "we won't be able to be in class and you",
    "know i think that is a",
    "there's some pressure there i think",
    "there's some peer pressure",
    "with students who want to be in class",
    "who want to have a year",
    "at whatever college or university that",
    "they're going to they're paying money",
    "for it",
    "they want to be able to to have that so",
    "it really is",
    "as many presidents have told me uh it's",
    "really you know going to be up to the",
    "students and in what they do and look",
    "this is not any different than the rest",
    "of us who are not",
    "no longer in college uh you know it's",
    "all",
    "all judgment judgments that we make",
    "decisions that we make",
    "um you know do we go out and socialize",
    "if we do how do we do it",
    "you know and so uh you know no one's",
    "telling students to uh",
    "uh you know to hibernate uh for",
    "for nine months of the school year or",
    "the whole school year or whatever",
    "but uh you know we're i think we're",
    "saying look",
    "this this is a reality uh if the numbers",
    "get too high and the spread is too much",
    "you know these schools are going to have",
    "absolutely no choice but but to pull",
    "back and we're seeing this across we're",
    "seeing this across the country",
    "so um it's it's that kind of i think",
    "pressure",
    "uh that kind of a reward there is a",
    "reward there and the",
    "reward is that you get a school year uh",
    "it may not be this",
    "quite the same as it's been in the past",
    "or would have been but",
    "it's a school year and uh you know",
    "you're getting getting your education",
    "and you can still socialize you can",
    "still",
    "you know have parties but you got again",
    "people have to make choices",
    "inside or outside this time of year you",
    "need to be outside",
    "what are you going to do do it outside",
    "you know wear a mask",
    "do these things and i think you know if",
    "you go back and you talk to the college",
    "presidents and you talk to the",
    "the deans and you talk to people who",
    "follow what's going on",
    "what they're going to tell you is well",
    "there is this party over here there's",
    "this party over here",
    "and then this happened and that spread",
    "out from there and they can they can",
    "pretty much trace it",
    "and uh but that's again no different",
    "than what happens with with with adults",
    "so we're not picking on college students",
    "we all have this responsibility",
    "next question is from dustin nsinger at",
    "gongwar news service",
    "all right we'll skip dustin next",
    "question is from justin dennis",
    "at mahoningmatters.com",
    "good afternoon governor we'd like to",
    "know if",
    "federal prosecutors coordinated with",
    "your administration on",
    "operation red zone which promises",
    "federal charges for",
    "illegal firearm possession and is",
    "expected to take place this",
    "weekend in toledo canton and here in",
    "youngstown",
    "we kind of want to get a sense of your",
    "thoughts about the program and also",
    "how you feel this aligns with your",
    "proposals to strengthen penalties for",
    "illegal firearm possession",
    "yeah i'm not aware of any any contact",
    "with our department",
    "uh or any of our departments i'm i'm not",
    "not aware of that you want to tell me",
    "more about the program",
    "yeah one moment so this uh federal",
    "prosecutors uh",
    "if we're going to be working with local",
    "law enforcement to",
    "find felons or misdemeanor offenders who",
    "have been possession",
    "of firearms if they're on disability",
    "they'll face",
    "federal charges as well that's a program",
    "that's happening in",
    "toledo canton youngstown this weekend",
    "well i'm happy to see the priority i",
    "mean quite candidly i've lived through a",
    "lot of different justice departments",
    "uh and sometimes you know it's a",
    "priority sometimes it's not a priority",
    "uh",
    "and",
    "the federal prosecutors have a",
    "significant advantage today",
    "over local county prosecutors in ohio",
    "in the area of what we call weapons",
    "under disability which is",
    "one of the things you've you all have",
    "heard me say kind of week after week as",
    "we see violence in our cities",
    "uh i've said look one of the things we",
    "can do is increase the penalties for",
    "people who have a gun",
    "but are a felon and have no right to",
    "have that gun",
    "and so but our law today in ohio is not",
    "nearly as tough as the federal law is",
    "so we depend uh prosecutors if they get",
    "a case",
    "like that and they want to get a heavier",
    "penalty they walk across the street or",
    "whatever it might be",
    "and go see the u.s attorney and see if",
    "the u.s attorney will be willing to file",
    "those charges",
    "the problem is that u.s attorney can",
    "only file so many cases",
    "they can only handle so many cases",
    "through the federal court system",
    "so what we have proposed and what is in",
    "front of the state legislature",
    "is something that will change that it",
    "won't change what the feds do",
    "but it will allow our local prosecutors",
    "our 88 county prosecuting attorneys in",
    "ohio",
    "to go after these violent repeat",
    "offenders",
    "who are carrying a gun and if they get",
    "one with a gun",
    "i can literally throw the book at them",
    "and then give the judge",
    "uh more discretion on on a sentence so",
    "you know",
    "that that going after particularly the",
    "again i don't know a lot about this",
    "program but it sounds like it's is",
    "focusing on",
    "uh people who are repeat offenders and",
    "people who do not",
    "you know who should not have a gun have",
    "no legal right to have a gun at all",
    "next question again is from uh dustin",
    "and singer at",
    "gangwood news service dustin please",
    "unmute your line",
    "hi governor uh we haven't heard much",
    "lately about the uh situation in the",
    "state's prisons could you provide us",
    "with an update on that and is your",
    "administration still releasing uh",
    "more medically vulnerable prison",
    "prisoners with 90 days or less remaining",
    "on their sentences",
    "uh the answer to the last question is",
    "yes",
    "what we're doing is we put a screening",
    "process in so certain offenses",
    "we're not going to let a sex offender",
    "out one day early",
    "not one day but",
    "other offenses once they hit if they're",
    "not a violent offense not a sex offender",
    "etc uh once they get within the 90-day",
    "window when they're going to come out",
    "anyway",
    "yes if they meet the criteria we are we",
    "are releasing them",
    "uh now as i recall we're testing them",
    "for kova to make sure we're not turning",
    "someone loose who",
    "who has coveted so we are doing that",
    "that is taking down the prison",
    "population",
    "to some extent it's the lowest it's been",
    "in a few years",
    "uh but what i will do uh on tuesday i'll",
    "give you a report we either have uh",
    "the director or by skype or i'll give a",
    "summary of exactly where we are",
    "in regard to in regard to our prisons",
    "next question is from adrian robbins at",
    "wcmh in columbus",
    "governor thank you for doing this um",
    "there's obviously concerns surrounding",
    "labor day and that seems to stem from",
    "what we saw after the 4th of july",
    "but are you concerned that a spike at",
    "this time could be more severe",
    "just because of other factors that are",
    "in play like schools and colleges being",
    "open",
    "and obviously we're getting much closer",
    "to flu season",
    "yes absolutely you're absolutely spot on",
    "you said it i couldn't say it better uh",
    "we're concerned we got colleges coming",
    "back we got schools coming back we want",
    "our kids to be in school",
    "um parents are making those choices we",
    "want them to have those choices we want",
    "kids to be able to play",
    "extracurricular things athletics et",
    "cetera",
    "but we know that that increases the risk",
    "and so it's very important",
    "that the rest of us who are out there",
    "who are making choices every day make",
    "the right ones and if we",
    "you know life is full of trade-offs if",
    "we want our kids to go to school in",
    "person",
    "then we have to wear masks we have to",
    "keep a social distance we have to slow",
    "the spread down so yeah",
    "i mean if if this labor day",
    "is like the fourth of july uh or worse",
    "from the point of view of people getting",
    "together and spreading",
    "you couple that with colleges you couple",
    "that with k-12",
    "yeah i worry about it i worry a lot",
    "about it and eventually it's gonna get",
    "cold",
    "um and you know the experts tell us that",
    "the odds are when it gets cold",
    "people go inside we know being outside",
