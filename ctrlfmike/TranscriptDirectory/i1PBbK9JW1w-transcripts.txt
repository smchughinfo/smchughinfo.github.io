well good afternoon
today i'm wearing a belmont college tie
belmont
college is located in belmont county st
claresville
they also have campus locations in
harrison county
as well as in monroe county the college
offers more than 28 degrees
24 certificate programs and disciplines
such as
allied health building preservation
restoration
business engineering technology
information technology
industrial trades and public safety
so eric let's go to the slides and we'll
look at our numbers
our case numbers are lower today
sometimes we'll see that on mondays and
tuesdays
we've seen this pattern actually pretty
regularly
care utilization may go down over the
weekend and sometimes it's reflected in
the numbers
uh we had relatively few deaths reported
today
although unfortunately we're nearing a
grim statistic
we're getting close to 4 000 deaths from
this
horrible horrible disease hospital and
icu emissions are holding steady
and really are kind of near their recent
recent range
eric let's look at the uh
cases uh these are the cases uh from
in 1 to 88.
uh we started doing this a few weeks ago
and this is to really reflect
how many cases in the last two weeks
each county has had
but then it is figured by a hundred
thousand
uh calibrated by a hundred thousand
population
so if you look what we'll see we'll go
to the top 10 eric and we'll look at the
top 10 here
you see the continuing spread into
rural ohio now our top 10 counties
all have populations at or below 60
000. so dark county has moved up
along with mercer is number two jackson
county
then henry preble fayette auglaise galia
ottawa and lawrence so from north
to south the only area that really is
not
very much represented would be you know
eastern ohio
gallia county can be called eastern ohio
but the far eastern ohio is not
represented there but again
this trend continues to go into the into
the rural counties
i want to take another look uh this week
at some tragic headlines just from this
past weekend we did this
last week and this is just a sad sad
story uh weekend gun violence
from friday through monday at least at
least as far as we can tell 25 people
were shot
in ohio 13 of them were killed here are
just two of the cases
and some of the more they're all tragic
but
these just are sickening
uh from w c mh in columbus
police say pregnant teens unborn baby
killed after shooting
in the linden area
a pregnant 15-year-old girl was shot in
the abdomen
she survived but her baby tragically
according to reports a little baby boy
did not and died just a few weeks before
he would have been born
from cleveland.com
14 year old dies 14 year old boy dies
after shooting in lorraine park
police say the boy was found near a
basketball court with multiple gunshot
wounds
saturday night he died sunday the man
accused of killing the teen had been
convicted of a
violent felony in the past meaning that
obviously he was legally prohibited from
having a gun yet he had the gun
nonetheless
according to the allegations he had that
gun anyway
and used it against this child
our legislation pending today in the
general assembly
will go a long way to deal with this
problem
and the problem is repeat violent
offenders
who have a gun our legislation
would give our judges would give our
prosecutors
our police a lot more ability to deal
with these individuals and get them out
of our communities
cincinnati police shared some of their
data with us regarding gun crimes
committed by those legally prohibited
from having a weapon over the past three
months in just three of their districts
nearly two dozen people who are
forbidden from carrying a gun because of
their prior
felony conviction were arrested for
shooting or shooting at
someone and it's not just cincinnati
this is happening
all over the state here is another case
in the headline
this week from the akron beacon journal
akron man
wanted in four shootings in three states
arrested in south dakota
this man was a target of a nationwide
manhunt after
alleged shootings in ohio west virginia
and indiana two people died the suspect
due to his criminal history is legally
prohibited from possessing a gun
as i've been saying for months ohio's
law and illegal gun
possession aren't tough enough right now
when someone who is prohibited from
having a gun is found with a gun
is often not considered a serious felony
offense
so they frequently receive probation
instead of jail time
and they go right back to the streets
under our bill it would become a
second-degree felony
which is a more serious offense with a
presumption of a prison
sentence the bottom line is this
those who illegally possess guns are
oftentimes the ones
who use them again ohio's failure to
properly address
felons who carry guns and use them to
commit crimes
allows these individuals to wreak havoc
throughout our communities
and stay in those communities if we
truly
truly want to address the issue of gun
violence in this state
we must deal with a small number of
criminals who are willing to illegally
use a gun to inflict harm
on others our legislation
would give judges better ability to
sentence these
offenders to prison and get them off the
streets
this is a bill and this particular
provision in the bill is something
that chiefs of police have been talking
about for a long long time
and notice i said it's a relatively
small number of people
i think if you talk to your chief if you
live in a city
if you talk to your chief or talk to a
police officer they will tell you
that the majority of the violent crime
is committed by a relatively small
number of the criminal element
and in a large majority of these cases
these are people who have already
committed felons
they've been told they're not allowed to
have a gun they can't have a gun
and yet they go ahead and commit the
offense so having the ability
to find that person in possession of a
gun
before they commit an offense and get
them off the streets and give the judge
the discretion to sentence them for a
significant period of time will save a
lot of lives
i want to take a few moments to talk
about the sports
order that we issued last week and
particularly the variance because we put
this
in here for a very specific uh reason
and i know some school districts i've
talked to some of the superintendents on
the phone they've had some questions
about this so let me kind of go go
through this
and just remember our our goal is to
have the athletes playing the young
people
playing the sport and have the ability
of their parents
family members to attend and actually
watch them
so the goal is no spectators other than
family members either family members of
the
the ball team or if it's a football team
and there's a there's a
marching band at halftime we want the
parents to be able to come and see their
children play in the band as as
as well so that's really the the goal uh
we limited the maximum number of
spectators gathered to the lesser of
1500
individuals or 15 percent of fixed
permanent
seated capacity for outdoor sports
events so that's for outdoor sports
events for indoor
it's the lesser of 300 individuals or 15
percent
of the fixed seated permanent capacity
for indoor sports
venues the primary purpose of permitting
spectators
at school sports event is to allow
officials and family and
household members and loved ones of the
players of the coaches
team staff members other event
participants including marching band
honor
honor guard for both home and away
teams to attend and share in the
experience
ideally the spectator limit would enable
at least two and maybe four
family members to attend the sporting
event provided that the venue is large
enough to allow at least a six
foot of social distancing between
individuals who are seated
we know that the fixed seating capacity
of some
sports venues particularly our smaller
schools
that might not allow this to happen and
that's why we have
a variance procedure
so the one of the reasons why the sports
order contains a variance
uh provision allowing schools is to
allow schools to submit a plan
to their local health department so you
need to go
first to your local health department
and then also to the state of ohio but
the health department the local health
department will take the first action
and then we will follow up in regard to
that
so the order requires that the variance
plan include they can have a little map
in there if you want to
but a justification as to why the
circumstance of the venue
justified different capacity requirement
and
second how the submitted plan will
adequately achieve similar results as
the requirements and guidance in the
order
in particular it is essential that the
variance plan demonstrate
that its proposed increased spectator
limit
will still enable at least six feet of
social distancing between
family groups it is the responsibility
of the school the venue
to home team to monitor and enforce the
social distancing requirement
as well as the prohibition on
congregating among spectators
and the other provisions that are
outlined in the sports order
evaluating a sports venue's variance
plan may require conversations with
school
officials venue officials and perhaps a
site visit
which is why the ohio department of
health will rely upon the local health
department to first conduct
their assessment of the variance plan
here's kind of my summary when schools
ask for a variance they should ask
themselves
these questions is the variance
necessary
to allow home and away
family members to be able to attend
two can the number of requested
spectators that you're asking
uh to go to can they be socially
distanced is it physically possible
three can the home school adequately
prevent the requested
number of spectators from actually
congregating i talked to a school
superintendent this week
uh who who told me yeah we could hold
this number
but and we could keep them distanced but
we can't we really can't control the
crowd
and so you know you have to kind of work
through that
i would further add though the variance
was not designed
for a big stadium just to be able to
fill fans in there much as we would love
to have all fans back
we've got to keep our eye on the ball we
got to start off slow
and so the goal is to have spectators
but the only spectators really be
family members of those who are
participating in the event
uh or in the case of band members uh
those who are playing it maybe playing
at halftime or have some other
uh role in in that the game itself or
the halftime events if it's football or
whatever whatever the sport might be
that you might have another group it
could include
family members or cheerleaders for for
example
let's talk for a moment about the census
again we want to remind you about the
census very important
it takes about 10 minutes to fill this
out
and really our representation in
congress will be determined
by the number of ohioans who are counted
a different assistance that comes in
federal funds
many many things are determined by what
the account is
uh our goals have an accurate account
which we need
which means we need you we need you to
fill out your your census form and so
we'll ask you to do that
we have kind of a treat today uh the
people who are really on the front line
in regard the coronavirus are
are health commissioners uh they're the
ones who are out there
i talk to them and listen to them mostly
uh every monday morning
early morning call and i learned some
very much from them
this is really a partnership that we
have with them 113 separate health
departments around the state of ohio
first i'd like to introduce you to
charles patterson
of the clark county combined health
district
charlie has been clark county health
commissioner for the past 20 years
he has more than 31 years of public
health experience
at the state and the local level
so charlie thank you very very much for
for joining us
thank you governor dewine let me just
maybe
look a little bit at at clark county and
maybe if you could just kind of tell us
uh how this has evolved maybe going back
to at least when we
we started the the color color code and
kind of tell us what the evolution has
been and maybe
where you are today well we we started
uh with the orange color code after
about two weeks we moved up
we had a few weeks of red
back to orange and then last week due to
our current circumstances
we're back at the red hazard level we
started
basically with businesses and employers
especially those essential employees
that had to go to work every day
as the schools were closed and many
other businesses were
these folks weren't allowed to stay home
and so
they they passed that along and several
large outbreaks including a dole
we had some outbreaks uh in
manufacturing and warehousing in madison
county that affected our community as
well
at this point uh we're seeing it in the
general population
and unfortunately that now is starting
to affect our nursing homes
and the the one way we're knowing that
it's affecting the nursing homes is
because
the national guard testing that's going
on uh it's a phenomenal program
we're seeing the employees tested every
two weeks uh
unfortunately with that testing we are
starting to find the indicators of
employees and and now residents at our
long-term care facilities being affected
so in your case you were actually seeing
kind of community spread then move into
the nursing home
is that kind of the absolutely
we had the the we were seeing 55 cases a
week or so
uh and now that's moved into the nursing
home long-term care
that's bumped us up to more like 75 to
80 cases a week now
with those residents and employees being
affected
and um talk talk to us a little bit
uh commissioner about the start of
school
uh clark county you have kind of
some schools are remote i think and some
are in person maybe some are hybrid
how do you how do you handle that or
what do you what do you see
going forward because i know that you
know the partnership between you
and the superintendents you and the
schools is a is a very very important
partnership as schools start back
up well we have we do have a great
partnership with our superintendents
but as you know local control is very
important in ohio
and local school boards have have chosen
the the entire gamut here in clark
county we have
a couple of districts that are fully
remote
we have a couple of districts that are
doing the hybrid
and a couple that are going back to
school full-time
each of those districts has a plan in
place to try to keep those students and
teachers in school as long as possible
and we'll be very closely monitoring
that here in clark county
to make sure we can keep those schools
open one of the things that we have to
be very careful though is
personal responsibility of all of our
citizens because just as we've seen it
affect our
long-term cares we know that if people
are not following your guidance
with the social distancing and the
masking we very quickly could see
this transmission in the schools and
then we'll have to work closely with the
superintendents that are
in person to see if we can continue that
how we doing in clark county in regard
to
social distancing and wearing mask out
in public i
you have any anecdotal uh
what you have seen maybe what your
health department's seen well we've
certainly seen
a lot more masks on individuals
since your mandatory mask order but i
would tell you that the number of
complaints we're getting
has also written risen because of that
people want to go to a store they want
to go to a a place of business
and feel safe and they only feel safe if
everybody's wearing masks so we still
have enough people
not following the guidance that that's
throwing our numbers off and that's why
we continue to battle this in the in
in our community uh maybe a last
question if we could go back to the
schools
for for a moment um
just as the nursing homes many times
will reflect
um you know the community spread
certainly schools are going to
and and do those they're open now uh
reflect the community
spread um what's
what's the procedure what what's the
procedure school follows
if let's say that you know they have
some
indication they have a student who has
some of the symptoms well the first
thing that will happen is the contact
tracers at the health department will
work with the school districts we have
designated people at each of the school
districts that will be sharing
information with
the school nurses are very vital to this
effort moving forward
and we'll look at seating charts we'll
see
exactly who has spent that less than 15
minutes
or more than 15 minutes less than six
feet away and those individuals
who surround a positive case will be
quarantined
the positive cases will be isolated and
we won't look at entire class if we can
we'll leave as many kids in place as we
can
but those individuals who are affected
we are going to have to make sure we
stop the spread by that quarantine order
well commissioner thank you very much
not just for being here today but thank
you for what uh you do to keep clark
county the citizens of clark county safe
and uh we we want to thank not only you
but your whole team you've got a great
team there and uh
we we just appreciate we know you guys
are working really really hard and this
is uh there's no let up in this so
so thank you for what you do thanks for
acknowledging the team
governor they they're doing yeoman's job
out there they are indeed thank you
thanks a lot commissioner let's go up
north
to medina i'd like to turn to krista
wazowski health commissioner at the
medina county health
department she's been a health
commissioner for 15 years
passed eight of those in medina county
before that she was not too far away in
marrell county
she has 28 years of public health
service
medina was read for three weeks
july 23rd and the 30th and august
6th uh commissioner you want to kind of
first of all thanks for for joining with
us and can you kind of maybe
give us as charlie did can you kind of
give us the uh
rundown of what uh where you are in
medina county now and kind of where
you've been how you got there
sir thank you governor uh so medina
county
you know since mid early june actually
we've
only had 17 covic cases coming out of
congregate settings
we too have had the ohio national guard
in here doing
testing a lot of testing happening
within congregate settings
but the cases that we're seeing in
medina county are really coming from
community spread
so to give you an idea back in back in
may we were seeing
14 cases a week on average and then in
july we were seeing 74 cases a week on
average
and now in august we're seeing 85 cases
a week on average
so while medina county has never been
designated as a high incidence county
even
even the weeks when we were red we do
have some communities
in our county that are having more
significant spread
so some of the challenges that we're
having
are people giving complete contact lists
to us
i think sometimes when people have a
mild illness they don't really want to
inconvenience their friends
but really contact notification and that
tracing process
and working with working with public
health is really the only way
that we're going to get in front of this
virus
you know we want people really to
remember that the virus
it may be mild for you but it might not
be mild for that next person
really to commissioner patterson's point
you know those cases that ended up in
the community and then finding its way
into his nursing home
they've actually had some rather tragic
outcomes from that in his county
you talked about different parts of the
county
where do you see it most uh the northern
the northern part of medina county are
our border that's closest
you know we're a suburb of both akron
and of cleveland so
it's our northern end of our county
where we're seeing more of our cases and
communities spread
and talk to me a little bit if you can
about the opening of schools and
kind of what your relationship has been
with the the different school districts
worked very closely with all of our
superintendents i had a call with them
just prior to this call so
as in clark and many of our other
counties people have different plans
the beauty of local control is that
those local plans are in place a lot of
safety protocols
but really our ability to keep our
schools open and to keep
our students playing sports and doing
extracurriculars
really rely on us being able to contain
this virus
and talk to me a little bit about
um
how you how you're seeing this occur you
talked about community spread
um maybe anecdotally what
if you trace these back and i understand
we can't always trace them back
sometimes
it's out in the community and you just
can't really figure out but are you
seeing
when you do trace it back what what are
you seeing
yeah sure we're seeing what we're seeing
is a lot of
unintentional exposures you know some of
our young adults in particular
are having mild symptoms it seems like a
cold to them
and so they think it's okay to maybe go
to sporting events or to work
or to other social gatherings and then
once their tests are coming back
sometimes they're surprised that they
have covid and that they've infected
other people
and so what we're really we really need
across the state we need
with our schools opening really for
parents
to be willing to kind of step in and
keep kids home and keep their friends
away
while we try to why we try to contain
the virus so
i i know everybody is anxious to get
back and we are all anxious to get back
and to see one another and
it's exciting to have school back in
session but those safety protocols that
we put into place
at sporting events and in school those
need to carry over
into the other interactions that our
kids are having outside of the school
if we want to keep our schools healthy
maybe walk
through a kind of a hypothetical case
let's let's say it's a it's a young
person
and they have symptoms or let's just
maybe it's an older person they have
symptoms
what what do you what should they be
doing they they go in
and let's say they're let's say they
take a test let's get them that far they
take a test
and they're waiting so what what's the
protocol what are they supposed to be
doing then
yeah so what what we really need to see
happen is
if there's that level of suspicion
either on the part of the person to seek
out testing or to have a doctor
prescribe that and to have that occur
is really for for that person to assume
that their test is positive
and to really isolate themselves away
from other people
and if possible ideally away from other
people even within their household
um to contain that and to not have other
people also become
positive um you know a lot of times
people
um want to want to believe that they're
not sick and it's not
covid and um and that's really where
we're seeing other people becoming ill
because because folks are kind of living
their normal life
and doing what they what they would
normally do while they're waiting for
that result to come back
so we really need people um if you
are waiting for your test results to
come back truly
staying at home and staying away from
other people is um
is you being a really good a good friend
a good neighbor
and and really a good co-worker and your
time counts
uh right during that period of time
right it does
if you're symptomatic the time that
you're spending at home in isolation
that counts towards your total isolation
period that public health will ask you
to stay away from people so
um you're just sort of getting a jump
start on that and you're also
keeping that list of contacts very small
if you're if you're staying home and
away from other people
so we're part of the way in this we're
not quite sure how far
um but you've been battling this for
some time you and
your team
[Music]
tell me the future in medina what do you
what do you worry about
uh what are you optimistic about just
kind of
you don't have a crystal ball i don't
have a crystal ball but kind of what
how do you see things in medina yeah
yeah so
i'm very optimistic we have the mascot
medina campaign
we're seeing we're seeing more mass
being worn to the point that
commissioner patterson made people are
expecting to see
masks when they go into places as a
safety measure
so i'm very optimistic about that um
some of the things that concern me are
um
are that spread that we're gonna that
we're seeing
within within our younger within our
younger
citizens we really we really need to get
ahead of this
and we need to get ahead of this before
flu season starts that's for sure
in in getting ahead of it means what to
you
to me it means um keeping it
keeping one person who's ill keeping
that
number that they that they also get ill
very very small
so back in the beginning our list we
only had
maybe a one contact and very few
very few a little bit of disease spread
but as we
come up now we're having 10 15
many contacts and so that just
exponentially potentially spreads that
disease so
when i say get in front of it i mean all
of us being very responsible
it's really to one another and if we're
feeling ill staying away
and containing that illness well
commissioner thank you very much and
also thanks to all your team
uh medina health department uh thank you
we we appreciate what they do uh we know
they're working
long hours and tough and uh you know
the end is not in sight it will get here
though we know that
and uh but we thank thank you and thank
them
appreciate it very much thank you
i'm going to turn it over to john husted
it happens to be the lieutenant
governor's birthday today so happy
birthday
lieutenant governor and i'll let you
take it from here
well thank you governor i appreciate
that i have
i have a uh something that was sent to
me
and you got some of these too it's from
the centerville noon optimist i think
we've
both over the course of years spoken to
them and uh they're they're
handing out masks to people uh to spread
a little optimism in the world and so
we thank the centerville optimus club
for that
and and all the great service
organizations that are out there
helping young people doing things uh to
weave their community together and
and and serve others so we thank them
uh i'm i got a little economic news few
uh
workforce related items i want to touch
on today
um look over we're on the road to
recovery
uh economically speaking we've got to
keep the momentum going
you don't want it to stall out we've
seen the unemployment rate drop from 17
percent
uh to 8.9 percent uh presently
a lot of people are going back to work
and they're also
finding as they look for work that the
nature of work sometimes has changed
there are different opportunities out
there that require
different kinds of skills one great
resource this is a we use this as kind
of a
gauge on how things are going is ohio
means jobs
there are currently 169 151
total jobs on there nearly 80 000 of
those
have a salary of over 50 000 a year
plus uh there are eighteen hundred
internships available
and all of that is at ohiomeansjobs.com
uh and that brings me to
uh another opportunity that exists out
there and that is
through our development services agency
they have a scholarship
program called the diversity and
inclusion internship program and the
goal
of the diversity and inclusion
internship program is to recruit
uh eight you know non-typical students
that maybe don't pursue
tech as a skill to help them
get access to an internship and
opportunity anyone is eligible
for this but there are 200 scholarships
available
our challenge right now is only 26
companies
have offered themselves up to provide
these internships so this is a message
to two audiences we need employers
uh to offer up those internships uh the
application period is open right now
for companies and that's through
september the eighth
uh and there's every reason for a
company to wanna do this because
through the scholarship program we'll
pay two-thirds of the cost of the
interns
wages to help develop those skills in
that tech area
and for students the application period
opens up today and is available through
september 22 so we know in a coveted
world that
that a lot of people are rethinking work
they're rethinking education
maybe they want some real life
experience and they can use
the distance learning opportunities that
are available through some of these
internship programs and others
it's a great win for people tech talent
development for businesses
individuals learn some real work
experiences and
and it's really you know a great uh
economic deal for the businesses to help
get a lot of that internship paid for so
we encourage
folks to to go to the
development.ohio.gov website we'll also
push this out on social media
to get businesses and and and students
involved
a little update also on antibody testing
serological testing
uh we're conducting department of health
is conducting the survey
it's getting very close to the end
remember we
we do these surveys to say to basically
come to the conclusion of how many
people out there in the population
have antibodies that they may have
developed as a result of having
covid19 we get a little snapshot of this
from the american red cross on a weekly
basis and
and uh that data for the latest data
from the american road red cross in ohio
shows that we have a
an uptick of on that number
about 2.2 percent of the population that
gets tested with the american red cross
has the
uh antibodies and and uh and so we can
presume
that that somehow some to some extent
reflects the population you've had
the virus and uh and then governor
really appreciate the
i know a lot of a lot of families
appreciate the update you gave about
sports because
when you read these orders we know
they're written in in
legal language many times and we get the
questions but
look we're we're going to accommodate
families we want the families to be out
there
uh watching their student athletes
participate and
and there's a way to make sure that
every school can do that for both home
and away fans and
and we we we know our department of
health is
is looking at those variances with when
conjunction with the local department
health and
we're gonna get mom and dad out there to
see their sons and daughters participate
thanks governor we're ready for
questions
governor your first question is from uh
ben schwartz at wcpo in cincinnati
good afternoon governor dewine um i'd
like to ask
about 11 a letter that representative
thomas west's office
says was sent to you earlier i'm urging
you to consider deploying the national
guard
to work as poll workers if needed i'm
wondering if you've been able to give
that request any thought yet and if you
consider deploying the guard
well i'm going to rely on frank larose
and see what frank thinks i know frank
has plans
uh and i know locally uh they're working
to recruit people
uh to be the poll workers so um
you know what we do have and i think
it's a very it's a very
good question and i think it's a good
point um
you know we have some older poll workers
uh who
in the world of kovad may not feel safe
uh sitting there at 13 hours where the
polls are open and they got to get there
earlier than that
so it's a long day but they're exposed
to a lot of different people so i think
that's going to be our challenge this
year
and so you know i'm going to rely on
what uh the secretary of state
he's all over this uh but if we see a
problem uh
we're open to any kind of you know
suggestions but
um you know we want people uh you know
we want to continue to be able to
recruit people to be
poll workers it's a process that needs
to to take place
and so we'll we'll kind of watch this
and see how it's how it's going
and we thank the poll workers by the way
who spend long days and do this
thank them very much yeah governor can i
add something to that
um look everybody who's watching today
you can be a poll worker
everybody who's out there across the
state of ohio
on 11.7 million people almost i guess
we can get them out there and be bold
workers uh we're really encouraging high
school students because we're their
provisions that allow high school
students
to get out there and work at the polls
and they may not be physically in school
that day or even online because a lot of
schools close down
on election day because their facilities
are being used
convert those high school seniors to
poll workers they're young they're
strong
and they also can make a little money at
the same time so we hope
to enroll a new generation of workers
out there as well
thanks ben next question is from jack
windsor at wmfd in mansfield
hi governor uh
five texas republicans as you may know
uh sued texas republican governor abbott
over a 295 million dollar contact
tracing deal
signed during the early months of the
coronavirus pandemic
legislators there say the governor
skirted separation of powers agreeing to
a contract
without following state statutes as you
know i've been
waiting for months now for information
on our contract with the company
assisting us with contact tracing uh
partners in health
i have to assume that is a multi-million
dollar contract and our audience is
interested in understanding
the length and value of that deal so
governor how much
have we paid partners in health how much
are we obligated to pay them
and how long is the contract i don't
know the answer jack but we certainly
can get that answer
i don't see any reason that we cannot
get that answer next
on thursday exactly where we are i would
point out that
while partners are health uh you know
you've you've kind of highlighted them
with some questions and
and i i talked about them several times
because they they have done this
uh worldwide this type of activity but
you know the tracing
uh you know relies really on our local
health departments
they're the ones who are doing most of
the hiring we have come in and hired
tracers so that we can if a county is
overrun uh something happens
so that we can put tracers in there so
we we hire they hire
partners of health have played some role
as far as advising
because we respect the work that they do
in that in that particular area but
we'll get you that information
next question is from jesse ballmert at
the cincinnati enquirer
hi governor my question is as as
students are returning to schools
how are schools going to report covet
cases
to the public well
jesse that's a very good question i'm
laughing a little bit
because uh we we've been discussing this
and i've
tasked my team with coming up with a a
basically a
consistent state plan in other words
the way these are reported to the public
should be
whether it's in belmont county or huron
county
or hamilton county it should be the same
way
so we will have a procedure
to outline for you on thursday
so your question anticipated something
that we're working on because frankly i
felt it needs to be consistent
we need to protect because the law says
we
should and because the right thing
individual and
into individuals health information
but uh you know knowing that something
is going on
uh is is important and so i it's also
important not only that it be reported
to you know it needs to be reported the
health department
obviously but it needs to be also in
real time reported to parents
so that parents have an idea of what's
going on and that needs to be
also reported to the news media so we'll
have we'll have the specifics
of that for you on thursday
next question is from laura bischoff at
the dayton daily news
i think laura may have dropped off so
our next question is from
uh john reed at gongwer news service
good afternoon governor um with uh
college students returning to campus
there have been some major outbreaks at
other colleges in other states in
alabama and north carolina
have you seen any evidence of similar
situations may be happening here
and if so how do you prevent that how do
you deal with that when it comes up
well i was on a call this morning that i
put together
to talk with our university presidents
of our state
four-year institutions we went through
that we talked
a lot about that i mean we have seen you
have seen just in the news media
uh you know you saw miami announcement
this morning or last night
uh saw some news youngstown state um
i talked to both both presidents about
about that uh
they both have it you know under under
control but
look i think the lessons that we see in
colleges
quite candidly are similar to the
lessons that we are seeing
uh among the population that's not going
to college
usually older and that is that
the spread is occurring because people
are letting their guard down
the spread is occurring because people
are getting together
and because they're with friends they're
in a social situation
sometimes they're drinking they let
their guard down they don't wear a mask
they don't keep a social distance
if you look at the outbreaks on college
campuses a lot of them have come
directly from that type of a party or
that
type of an event
i've told the college presidents i told
them yesterday morning i said look i i
think that
you certainly are in a good position and
you will
protect these your students you have a
plan you'll protect your students when
they're in class
uh you'll protect them in the library uh
you'll protect them
uh probably pretty well in in the dorms
uh but what i worry about is what they
do the other
times and just human nature being human
nature and what it is
uh so one of the university presidents i
i talked to this this week one of our
private schools
i think summarized it pretty well he
said really it's going to be up to the
students
if the students want to stay on campus
if they want to
continue to be able all of them to be in
class
or or to be on campus with some either a
mixed
hybrid process or or entirely back in
class
they're going to have to control it and
they're
they're going to have to have the
internal the discipline
and they're going to have to frankly
have a little peer pressure on other
students
who maybe are doing things that are not
very productive to
to stay and staying in class so am i
worried yes i'm worried
i think we have every right to be
worried as we
k through 12 goes back many places in
person
many places where we have uh significant
community spread
uh at the same time our campuses are
filling back up with students and
you know to state the obvious even when
campuses are remote for a while
we're still seeing students go back
physically to the campus
particularly those who are living off
campus
they're just moving back and you you can
be
remote you can be online but they're
still back in in
congregating and in whatever community
that is
so these are all challenges that we face
but i think the good news is
i'm confident that every state
university i'm confident
you know the private schools all have a
plan they're all on it
they're doing the best that they can but
it's ultimately going to come down to
frankly what the students do
and you know what kind of year that
they're going to be able to have
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
hi governor um we've heard from some
long-term care facilities nursing homes
assisted living centers
that are struggling financially and just
having trouble resource wise
with addressing the pandemic i'm curious
is there anything more that the state
can do to step in and help with that and
if so what might that be
well i mean we've been we've been paying
uh as you know for a great deal of the
testing
we understand that they're under certain
stress
you know we've been helpful in regard to
those who
you know have medicaid patients so these
are things we we
will constantly monitor uh and
constantly you know continue to talk
with them um you know it's it's
important that
every whether it's an assisted living uh
whether it is a nursing home
uh you know obviously that they have the
the ability to keep going and they have
the ability to employ people
and they follow the best sanitation
practices
and that the testing be occurring so
we're helping them with the testing
we're trying to help them in regard to
the
sanitation but we're certainly open to
look at other things that we
might might be able to do
next question is from kevin landers at
wbns in columbus well governor thanks
for taking mike
my question uh two-parter for you first
of all are you taking calls for your
impeachment seriously and secondly
it's been several weeks since the order
was in place to
curtail alcohol sales at bars do you
think
that is going to last through the end of
the year is there any data
that you've seen that shows that's
working thank you
sure well let me talk about
the first question you ask my focus
as governor is going to continue to be
and my priority
priorities are to keep people safe and
to get our economy
moving faster getting people more people
to work
growing our economy and saving lives so
that's where my focus
is um if there are others
in the legislature uh who want to spend
their time
on uh the the you know drawing up
resolutions and filing articles uh
you know look it's it's it's a free
country that's how they want to spend
their time
you know i would just say to them have
at it
but my focus uh is to do what i'm sworn
to do and that is to protect the people
of the state of ohio
to get this economy moving faster to
save lives
that's what i'm going to do uh second
question
in regard to the bars um you know kevin
it's it's a work in progress i mean
we're going to continue to evaluate this
you know unfortunately you know
fortunately most bars are doing a good
job
as you can tell by the citations that
are issued we have some that are not
following the law
so this is something that we're going to
continue to look at no decision has been
made
next question is from andrew welsh
huggins at the associated press
hi governor
kevin's question so the the impeachment
proposal announced monday was obviously
a tiny effort just for lawmakers
but um you know several other of your
fellow republicans have
expressed concerns about your approach
to the coronavirus and
what they've called a heavy-handed
response and they've sponsored a number
of bills to restrict your and the health
director's powers
so i guess my question is what concerns
do you have
not about the impeachment but about your
legislative support regarding the
pandemic as
you know time goes on and the health
orders stay in place
well we don't want any health order to
stay on a day
an hour or a second longer than it needs
to be on
um we're going to get through this and
my goal is to
for as many ohioans as possible all of
us if possible
to get through this because we'll get
through this
there will be a vaccine there will be
things that
are there to get us moving uh so we're
gonna get through it
but we gotta we gotta get through it um
look i i am there's nobody more open
than i am
uh every legislator has my cell phone
uh as we found out when one of the
legislators posted that on the internet
uh so everybody's got got my phone
number now
but look i have great deal of respect
for the for the four leaders
i communicate with them they communicate
with me
it's a two-way street as far as
information but ultimately
this is a 102 year
pandemic and this is not an ordinary
time and so we're going to have to do
what we need to do to protect ohioans
i think the good news is that
basically everything is open the
restrictions you mentioned there's one
mention the last question you know 10
p.m
cut off of liquor you know we've got a
requirement that people out in public
wear a mask
but really what we're looking at is
sacrifices um that
compared to the gravity of what we're
dealing with are relative relatively
small sacrifices
you know the biggest sacrifices i think
most people are making is
self-imposed sacrifices not seeing their
grandkids or keeping a distance when
they do see their grandkids and look
these are just tough things
but they're not imposed by by me they're
they're basically
you know self-defined and you know we
tell people
keep a social distance uh we do all
those things because that's the best
health instruction that there can be uh
but we're gonna get through this
and uh you know we're gonna get through
it and ohio is going to
move forward and ohio families are going
to move forward
so i'm going to look i i do not shy away
from making decisions um
somebody has to make those decisions
when you're dealing with a 100-year
pandemic and i i make the decisions
some people agree some people disagree
but the thing i can assure you is that
each decision is made
with the best advice i can get from the
health community
uh and it's made with uh my dedication
and my commitment to the to the people
of the state of ohio and
keep them keep them safe and to keep our
economy moving
governor uh i wanted to add some
uh information to the answer on the
nursing home
question so far there have been
205 million dollars that are
appropriated to
long-term care facilities 180 million
to help them through coronavirus relief
funds another 25 million for
infection control uh and then
additionally there are
approximately 400 million dollars in
provider relief across all
spectrum in addition uh to to the
to behavioral health rural hospitals and
et cetera so
uh that that money uh has gone out much
of it's gone out to
long-term care facilities some of it's
still in process waiting on the
documentation
but uh to the to the earlier question
where uh we understand this challenge
that they've
that they all face and when we're trying
to get the relief dollars out to them as
fast as we can
thank you
next question is from adrian robbins at
wcmh in columbus
hi governor thank you for doing this
again um is there any update that you
could give when
ohioans could see the additional 300 for
unemployment and
ultimately when it does come do you
think that's going to be enough money
for these people
who continue to struggle during the
pandemic
well look i know people are are
suffering
we made the application the application
is in
um and you know i talked to the
labor secretary actually yesterday about
about that
my team tells me that assuming things
are approved
in a timely manner we make the switch
over
mechanical switch over and things that
need to be done that we're talking about
the first checks going out in
mid-september
to late september and those would be
retroactive so
you know the first check would be up
until that
that point in time i've made it clear in
my team we need to get this out just as
absolutely quickly as we can
people are hurting people need it
next question is from scott hallis of
the xenia daily gazette
hey hey governor thank you for scott
again um
i've gotten a couple emails and a couple
calls from some restaurant
and um bar owners here in greene county
um who have paid extra with their liquor
license to
be able to be open until 2 30. from what
they tell me it's you know several
thousand dollars extra with their liquor
license
you know they understand having to be
closed at first
now they're reopened and they can't you
know sell alcohol past 10. they were
wondering
you know because they're all struggling
financially would they be able to get a
break
you know they use the term refund on
their liquor license what they paid from
you know the normal one 1 a.m to the 2
30. would they be able to get a break
next year i'm sure there's other
you know owners around the state that
may have that same question
yeah we can certainly look at that i
think that's a valid point
um you know we gave them uh some break
uh when we everybody every every bar
um when they started back up after
they've been closed in regard to the
first i think it's
500 of the liquor but i know this is a
different issue
and so we'll look at that good question
we'll look at it next question is from
jeff radick at wsyx in columbus
afternoon governor you were talking
earlier about this variance plan for
schools and of course we've all been in
these
shoe box gymnasiums especially for youth
sports
uh and you said that a variants must
still
ensure six feet of social distancing how
can you ensure that all family members
will be able to
see these events
i think it can be done outside i think
inside
you know i i grew up in a in a high
school had a very very small gym
i've seen a lot of small gyms uh so you
know yes those are
those are difficult uh what we're simply
asking schools to do is to prioritize
families um and they're gonna have to do
you know they're gonna have to do the
best
the best that they can um we're trying
to get a balance here
um you know we want our young people to
play
sports for all the reasons that we know
sports are important
we want families to be able to be there
to support them
but we also want to minimize the spread
when you're talking about inside it just
becomes a much more difficult situation
we have learned over this coronavirus
five months or whatever
period of time that um you know inside
is just so much more dangerous than
than outside so the numbers are smaller
uh in inside
um but the social distancing is
is still very very very important so
it's a balance
uh you know each school is going to have
to kind of take the
priorities which have been set uh and i
think it's priorities frankly that we we
heard
from families kids want to play
we want to see them if we can and and so
we're trying to take those priorities as
established by ohio families
and work them through the biggest school
with the biggest gym to the smallest one
in the smallest
the smallest gym it's not always easy
but i'm i'm sure that schools will do
the best that they can
next question is from alex ebert at
bloomberg
good afternoon governor we're doing
coverage of governors that are
issuing executive orders or
contemplating doing so
they would mandate flu vaccines for
long-term care workers
they're about 65 compliant when it comes
to flu vaccine which is worse than every
other health care group
ohio has 55 percent of its coven 19
deaths are in long-term care facilities
and
there are groups around the country that
are worried about a confluence
of lawn care long-term care deaths due
to covid and flu this fall
would you consider issuing an executive
order mandating health care workers in
ohio
receive the flu vaccine and or covid19
vaccine when it comes out
thank you sir yeah that's a good
question uh
we're very concerned about the flu uh
we're already starting to plan
uh in regard to the flu frankly what i'm
hoping
uh is that in the world of the coveted
virus that we'll see
the use of the flu vaccine go up
and so that's that is what my hope is my
hope is that's what ohio ones will do
i think ohioans will recognize that you
now we will have two risk
uh one is the flu and one is the kovit
and
uh you know if there's a vaccine for one
there's not for the other let's get the
vaccine for the one that there is
so we're not we don't have any orders in
mind at this point
we're going to do everything we can to
encourage people to do that
and you know encouraging them to do that
you're going to see us
you know with probably with a media
campaign of some sort
to do that because it's so very very
important but that's
that's how we're going to approach it
next question is from andy chow at ohio
public radio and television
hi governor i was wondering if we could
talk about
new cases and where they're coming from
i know that you've talked
many times about how there's a lot of
spread through informal gatherings
i'm wondering if you can talk about how
much of the new cases are coming from
the workplace is that more or less than
from
informal gatherings is there any
indication from these new cases that
show you that the workplace
standards and protocols are working
you know andy it's hard to get exact
data on
answer your last question are these
standards working
you know anecdotally we think they are
um you know what we're seeing
and what health departments are seeing
generally
is that businesses are doing everything
they can to comply
um we know that some businesses are more
inherently dangerous for some reasons
meat packing places where it's cold
or winter actually is is kind of brought
inside
um for some reason you know those are
seeing a higher
uh rate uh but i don't really have any
data and and part of a part of the
problem uh
um you know we're not yet to the point
where we can we can take the tracing
and turn that into statistics we can
take the tracing and turn it into
anecdotal evidence but turning it into
the
to the statistics is something we can't
yet
do we do know
that we have seen outbreaks
the health commissioner in clark county
a few minutes ago talked about
dole outbreak at dual manufacturing
company
food processing company so we certainly
have seen them
some of those but as far as
statistically comparing
one to the other i we can't do that
next question is from shane stegmiller
at hannah new service
okay hi governor uh thanks for doing
this as always i wanted to ask you about
the capacity on arts and sports
entertainment
uh facilities uh performing arts
and sports places are 15
um some of the others don't seem to have
any capacity or like the casinos they're
at like 50 percent
are you planning on reducing any others
to 15
are you how do you come to the you know
which are
said at this fifteen percent which
yeah look i think that you know you make
an interesting point
um uh you know we're constantly
evaluating and trying to re-evaluate
and and one thing i want to assure the
people of ohio
is that you know we're trying to do this
from a
scientific point of view a medical point
of view
and talking to the best experts about
how we slow how we slow the spread
so when we talk about these venues for
example
uh the theaters um look
we know that the numbers that we have
set um
you know for a commercial production
uh is probably not going to work for
them
uh they pretty much have said that but
we also know
that it could work maybe for
a high school theater company
uh or the you know the the senior play
uh or
theater uh you know we've seen so many
kids get so much out of theater
you know under these guidelines they can
probably figure out some way of doing
that
um understanding that there are risks uh
you're inside
and and you're projecting uh as a good
theater major would do uh so you know
you have to kind of compensate
so uh one one step at a time and uh
we're just gonna but we'll continue to
evaluate
all the other things that that we are
out there doing
and the other limits that we that we
have set
thank you governor
next question is from marty schleyden at
the ohio capitol journal
afternoon governor marty um
this is the general observation it seems
as if during these uh
conferences we spent a lot more time
talking about youth sports
uh entertainment sort of middle class
concerns than we do
um what's going on in poor and minority
communities which are most vulnerable to
the virus
and i'm being told by some people who i
don't think are being alarmist that
things could get bad enough that it
could contribute to civil
unrest among these people as they don't
have jobs and become economically
desperate
do you think your administration is
focused enough on that
and more broadly do you think society as
a whole is
well i think we understand we understand
it i mean you've got
marty you've got two different things
and i think you're talking about two
different things they're certainly
related
uh one we continue to see um
a difference in the covid um
its impact on african americans its
impact on hispanic
uh in fact we had a chart that i had in
my briefing this morning that i thought
about bringing in we just didn't bring
it in but we could bring it in
which shows that the disparity that we
see among adults
has certainly been carried forward in
regard to to
young people so we're seeing
african-american children
who have a higher have these higher
rates higher numbers
and again that should not surprise us
you know so in regard to that
you know we put a lot of effort uh in
the national guard
going into areas that are underserved
we can i continue to focus on our team
and when we look at
the guard now has been pulled is pulled
out of the nursing homes and we've got
testing going on now that the nursing
homes themselves will be doing
uh we were two weeks now we're trying
you know two weeks
and now you know as we look to the
future we're trying to get that down to
one week
but the guard now has more ability to go
into other communities
and so again if anyone is watching any
of our legislators
who have ideas about areas that we need
to go
congregate living settings maybe
apartment buildings
other places to do testing uh we are
very much
uh uh willing to to do that
and so again trying to get underserved
areas
uh in in regard to that uh is
is very very important um you know
look we have uh we we talked about this
the other day we we have discrepancies
not just in health
uh we have other discrepancies uh the
plan that we outlined
you know we have other discrepancies not
just in health we have it in health
we have housing we have an education
between african-americans hispanic
and the white citizens of this state
so you know we laid out a plan um
but we're always open to to more ideas
and more
more things to look at so i don't know
john whether you have anything you want
to add
to that you were going over some data
with me today in regard to
unemployment and other things but sure
um
look we're this is why we're
applying for approval from the federal
government for
the 300 additional payment for people
who are unemployed
uh this is why you know we have some
exciting things that we're working on
we will announce soon with jobs ohio and
our
and our folks from the department of job
and family services who are working on
with local communities to uh target
populations who are traditionally
underserved
uh and where there are high unemployment
rates you see
what we were talking about today is
bringing
the private sector and public resources
together to educate
non-traditional students in tech so
you know we have tech cred which we talk
about all the time which is upskilling
different
different populations we're trying to
serve everybody
you know this has been our
administration's goal all along
when we started it was a four percent
unemployment rate
uh and businesses couldn't find enough
people and we were doing everything
under the sun to bring everybody into
the game
to get everybody off the bench we could
and put and put them
into a training program or job
opportunities
and we're very focused on that and we
don't want to leave anybody behind
whether you're at the
low end of the economic scale and in
terms of skills
uh we want to upskill you we want to get
you into a good job we want to
start people moving up that economic
ladder and
and we're we're focused not just on the
middle class and
not just uh on the poor we're focused on
everybody because that's what it takes
to have a vibrant economy we need
everybody in the game
employers need talent we need to keep up
skilling people
that's why we wanted schools to get back
into session so that we
we wouldn't lose academic progress from
our young people
and so we're i think we're
very focused on this topic every single
day
next question is from laura hancock at
cleveland.com
hi governor maryland virginia louisiana
michigan massachusetts
and ohio have come together to buy a big
batch of coronavirus
tests rapid tests and um rapid
anti-antigen tests and we were wondering
if you were if you can give us like an
update about where the state is i'm
procuring that
and also if you're at all concerned just
because a rapid test had come in false
positive for you
i mean there's there's a place for the
antigen tests
but you've got to be strategic about how
you
deploy that test and so we'll be talking
more about that we're still working on
it working with the other states
so don't really have anything more to
report today but there's a role for
antigen tests
it just has to be understood what what
they are
what their strengths are just as you uh
you know
the pcr tests have have certain
strengths and you have to need to
understand that
so we'll have more in the future but
we're not there yet
next question is from ori gibbons at
spectrum news
uh good afternoon governor dewine um i'm
wondering if you could just react to the
news from over the past week or so with
colleges reopening particularly
from the perspective of positive cases
and also from some of the concerns
around distancing on
you know campus or off-campus places
especially
yeah i mean i think what you worry about
um i've talked to
all of our college presidents um and
what they worry about
is what happens not in the classroom i
mean they gotta
you gotta do that right but i'm
convinced you know they know how to do
that
um it's okay in the library they know
how to do that
they got a plan for the dorms uh but
it's
it's all the time that the you know the
young person is on campus
uh or in the in that community maybe not
directly on campus but in that community
and what they do the rest of time but
that's no different frankly
than what we see with with the rest of
us um
you know we all uh kind of let our guard
down sometimes
and uh uh you know the strongest message
i believe
uh that we can give to young people and
it's not
not for me but from from college
presidents but it really is from their
their
fellow students is hey if we want to
stay on campus if we want to have a
regular year
as close to a regular year as we can uh
we gotta be careful
uh this is you know we can enjoy this
we have fun uh we can study we can learn
uh but it's not gonna be quite the same
and you're gonna have to keep the
distance uh these informal activities
are going to have to you have to be very
careful with them
uh and you just can't let your guard
down and that's really the that's really
the
the message that i hear um you know from
from college presidents
and uh you know as i talk as i talk to
people who are on campus that's that's
kind of the message
students got to do it
governor next question is the last
question and it belongs to jim hoddy at
whio in dayton
governor thank you the question i want
to go back to the articles of
impeachment
in terms of defending your approach here
what would you tell the people who are
behind this attempt
not just those four lawmakers but the
people have been following them
uh in terms of defending your approach
they say it is just not conservative
enough you're still hurting businesses
the mass mandate is an infringement upon
their freedoms what would you tell them
directly
well i'm a conservative i think
conservatives historically are to
preserve life
um to su to preserve liberty
and the things that we've done
and the things that we've talked about
doing
keeping the distance wearing a mask
and the other things that we've done
it's about preserving life
look we're going to get through this
we're going to get through this
you know we don't need to lose any more
than we need to lose
people who could get through this and
who could come out the other side and
have a great life ahead
no matter what age they are we don't
want to lose them
so i i think that
what we have done uh in consultation
with health
experts is in the tradition
of conservatism uh it is the
great tradition of freedom in this
country and that is we have always as a
people
always i think it's one thing that makes
us different than other countries
or at least something we're very proud
of is we're willing to make sacrifices
now for long-term gain
and the sacrifices we're talking about
now yes they are sacrifices
but the long-term gain is not just
we save lives long-term gain is we don't
destroy our economy
because the biggest threat we have today
to our economy
to our way of life to job creation
biggest threat we have is this virus
come roaring back through ohio
it's smoldering it's there it's flaring
up in some counties
we have put that fire out but that's
all about preserving
protecting liberty freedom
and basically our way of life and i
think my actions
this administration's actions that have
been so informed by the best
evidence that we could get all the way
through uh we may not have been right on
everything
but they've been taken in the point of
view
of of that in preserving our liberty
uh and so that's that's my answer to to
the people who
are critical and look uh there many
people watching today
who think you know i've not done a good
job they have every right to think that
uh we have a strong strong first
amendment
members of the state legislature who
want to spend their time
uh on instead of
dealing with the violence that we have
out there where we have
some bills that we know will make a
difference that will save lives
uh instead of some of the police reforms
that we've talked about and by the way
these police reforms are being put
together
by representatives of police uh along
with others
these are the things we ought to be
spending our time worrying about
uh but well as i say have at it if
members of the general assembly want to
spend their time on
on this they they certainly have every
right
to do that and that's their that's their
call but i'm gonna i'm gonna
focus on ohioans our lives i'm gonna
focus on our freedoms
we want to focus on keeping this state
moving forward
i guess that's the last question thanks
jim we'll see you all on
thursday thank you very much
[Music]
you
