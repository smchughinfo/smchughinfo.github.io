    "oh",
    "so",
    "afternoon everyone",
    "michael we'll start with our data slide",
    "these are the key indicators uh today",
    "and uh sadly we have a",
    "shockingly high number of cases 4",
    "961. this is an all-time",
    "high and put this in perspective about",
    "a month ago about four weeks ago",
    "that number was about a thousand so now",
    "it is five",
    "fold up and seemingly continues to go up",
    "all the time so if you look at the",
    "deaths uh sadly 33 deaths",
    "uh that's a higher rate than we've seen",
    "uh 20 20 was the 21 day average",
    "new hospitalizations and we'll talk",
    "about this in a moment 214 again higher",
    "than the 21 day average",
    "and i see you at missions 23 which is",
    "about what we have been",
    "averaging let's go to the slide in",
    "regard to",
    "cases this is cases",
    "per 100 000 in the last two weeks",
    "we've used this slide now for several",
    "months and",
    "what has changed we've seen",
    "the blue now creep across now into every",
    "county so the cdc has high",
    "incidents and what we are showing there",
    "is now that every county in the state of",
    "ohio is a high",
    "incidence county so",
    "it is everywhere we can't hide from it",
    "we can't run from it we got to face it",
    "and we have to deal with it so no matter",
    "where you",
    "live in the state of ohio you now have",
    "high incidents",
    "sadly you now have high incidence of",
    "covet in your county",
    "michael let's look at the next slide",
    "this is",
    "the top 20 counties",
    "ranked by highest",
    "occurrence the high incidence counties",
    "if you are in one of these counties",
    "your numbers are phenomenally high",
    "you know very dangerous spread certainly",
    "in in these counties",
    "starting with putnam mercer all glazed",
    "homes",
    "paulding noble defiance and on on down",
    "through those counties",
    "uh michael let's go to the next slide",
    "let's talk for a moment about hospitals",
    "and what's happening because like we get",
    "questions about that",
    "we continue to see increases in the",
    "number of cova",
    "19 patients hospitalized in the icu",
    "unit and on the ventilators",
    "today we have a record number of",
    "patients hospitalized",
    "2075 patients today",
    "is a 55 increase in hospitalized",
    "patients compared to two weeks ago",
    "again 2075 current patients today and",
    "that is a",
    "55 increase in hospitalized patients",
    "compared",
    "to two weeks ago we have a record number",
    "uh in the icu that's 541",
    "our previous high was 5 33",
    "in april so you can see it from this",
    "chart",
    "this chart goes back",
    "not too long ago a few days ago",
    "and you can see what it just continues",
    "uh sadly to to to go up",
    "um let me now go to um",
    "the daily new hospitalizations the seven",
    "day",
    "average um",
    "look at this slide and this gives it",
    "from a historical point of view this",
    "goes back to march",
    "so you'll see over here",
    "when we started out with",
    "hospitalizations you saw a very very",
    "very fast increase going up",
    "you're seeing not quite as fast here",
    "but it is going up at a very very very",
    "high rate",
    "and this is much faster than you know",
    "we've seen it since the beginning",
    "this is the incomplete data over here",
    "and again it's not this is not filled in",
    "yet",
    "but if it continues like it's been going",
    "here it will fill in",
    "and continue at that high unfortunately",
    "at that high rate",
    "um",
    "michael let's go to the cases uh",
    "versus the testing you know one question",
    "we frequently get is are cases",
    "increasing simply because we have",
    "increased our testing",
    "and we have increased our testing it's",
    "true that we've been successful",
    "increasing our testing capacity during",
    "the past several months",
    "better testing helps us to detect and",
    "measure the spread of the virus in ohio",
    "without testing we would certainly be",
    "flying",
    "blind and we have always wanted more",
    "testing and so we've got it up",
    "significantly",
    "however cases have also increased",
    "significantly in the past several weeks",
    "in fact",
    "our case data has increased a much",
    "higher rate",
    "than our our testing has so take a look",
    "at this",
    "chart as you can see from this chart",
    "since september 24th total number of",
    "tests",
    "has increased about 44",
    "so this is the number against september",
    "24th to the present",
    "or actually until until november third",
    "uh",
    "so total testing has increased 44 we're",
    "happy with that",
    "we want to continue to see that go up",
    "but if you look",
    "at the increased percentage of cases",
    "during that same period of time it's",
    "gone up 280 percent",
    "so obviously the increase",
    "in the cases is not caused just by",
    "the increase in testing",
    "let's go to our new data for the day",
    "our second part of the new data the",
    "first is when we",
    "rank the counties 1 through 88 this is",
    "our map system",
    "and this is the change that you're",
    "seeing",
    "here and you can see unfortunately red",
    "is spreading",
    "throughout the state the virus continues",
    "to spread throughout all regions of the",
    "state",
    "today we have 56 red counties the",
    "highest number of counties that are read",
    "since we started the alert system",
    "this is an increase of 13 from last",
    "week's",
    "43. we have no counties that are purple",
    "no counties that are on the watch list",
    "in addition to our continued",
    "record-breaking case numbers we are also",
    "seeing more visits than ever",
    "to doctors offices those are early",
    "indicators in emergency room",
    "room visits people going to the",
    "emergency rooms",
    "resulting ultimately in covenant 19",
    "cases there are also record number of",
    "ohioans of covert as we said in our",
    "hospitals",
    "and in icu the impact of cover 19 is",
    "being felt by more and more families",
    "we're seeing this in our weekly advisory",
    "system as well our 13 new",
    "red counties or ashland county champaign",
    "clinton pushockton fairfield henry",
    "holmes jefferson medina",
    "morrow pickaway preble and sandusky in",
    "each of these red cape",
    "red counties we are seeing high case",
    "numbers that are continuing to increase",
    "many of these new red counties are",
    "seeing sustained increases in visits to",
    "the doctor",
    "or emergency room for coven and some",
    "counties are seeing",
    "sustained increases in their residents",
    "being hospitalized for covet",
    "i want to take a moment bring your",
    "attention to the two",
    "yellow counties in southeastern ohio",
    "which you'll see down here",
    "and i was on a call this past week",
    "indicated that um from one of the",
    "yellow counties that people thought that",
    "because the county was red",
    "uh or excuse me was was yellow",
    "that there was not a problem it doesn't",
    "meet the indicators",
    "but as i said every county now in ohio",
    "even these the two yellow counties",
    "they are high incident level",
    "rating by the cdc",
    "last week noble and monroe counties were",
    "yellow this week monroe and morgan are",
    "yellow",
    "what we're seeing in these sparsely",
    "populated counties is an",
    "increased significant increase in cases",
    "but because",
    "there are so few residents the data that",
    "you would see reflected on our",
    "color map jumps around and we don't see",
    "a continuous or sustained increase in",
    "cases which is what's necessary for us",
    "to",
    "to advance the county into the next",
    "level the orange",
    "level so the data jumps around we don't",
    "see a continuous or sustained increase",
    "in cases or healthcare utilization",
    "in recent weeks that would flag the",
    "indicators in the health",
    "alert system however if you look at the",
    "past month or two it's clear if you look",
    "at these counties",
    "that trends in these counties are",
    "similar unfortunately to the rest of the",
    "state",
    "situation is getting worse and they",
    "cannot let their guard down",
    "if you live in a re any yellow county",
    "you can't let your guard down there",
    "either",
    "a closer look at this week's map the red",
    "counties have filled in",
    "much of northeast and southwestern ohio",
    "and include urban counties rural",
    "counties",
    "and everything in between of the 13 new",
    "red counties today",
    "seven have never previously been read",
    "let me read what those are these have",
    "not been read before",
    "champaign clinton coshockton holmes",
    "jefferson",
    "morrow sandusky this high number of",
    "never before read counties as something",
    "we've not seen since the early days of",
    "the advisory system",
    "this is yet another sign that the",
    "disease is affecting",
    "ever more parts of the state of ohio",
    "parts of the state that previously had",
    "been relatively untouched",
    "by the virus let's look at the next",
    "slide",
    "michael",
    "here's a look at the percentage of",
    "ohioans living in red",
    "counties and you can see how this has",
    "changed over",
    "over time and you can see today is",
    "at unfortunately an all time high",

    "a reason for hope at the end of this and",
    "and this team certainly adds",
    "adds to our ability to bring that home",
    "uh two",
    "two quick things that i wanna make aware",
    "on the economic side",
    "uh business relief grants uh on monday",
    "people will begin",
    "or were able to apply for those",
    "businesses were",

    "them from all 88 counties",
    "there's going to be 125 million dollars",

    "their uh um applications submitted to",
    "the development services agency",
    "and they will begin this week to make to",
    "make businesses aware",
    "if they qualify for those grants so",
    "so if you applied know that development",
    "services",
    "agency will begin notifying you of that",
    "of those grant awards this week another",
    "thing",
    "we've mentioned it governors mentioned",
    "it we're doing calls",
    "with county leadership mayors county",
    "commissioners",
    "business leaders from around the state",
    "one of the things that came up",
    "that we want to take the opportunity",
    "today to clarify is that",
    "in some cases people are finding out",
    "that they've been quarantined",
    "and they may either not have health",
    "coverage from their employer or they may",
    "have already exhausted",
    "their their health leave",
    "that is being made available to them",
    "and they find out their quarantine one",
    "things that is important to know",
    "you are eligible for unemployment",
    "compensation",
    "for that time period you're out if your",
    "employer has ordered you",
    "out or if the local health department",
    "has ordered you out",
    "so we want people to know that as",
    "they're doing the right thing",
    "as they're quarantined they are eligible",
    "for unemployment compensation",
    "if you fit one of those categories",
    "you can find out more information at",
    "unemployment.ohio.gov",
    "we don't want people working when they",
    "shouldn't be there",
    "if you've so if you find yourself in",
    "that situation",
    "know that there are unemployment",
    "compensation benefits that you're",
    "eligible for unemployment compensation",
    "benefits",
    "and we want to make sure that you have",
    "access to those so governor a couple",
    "quick updates there",
    "and we can turn it back to you for",
    "questions great let's go to questions",
    "governor first question today is from",
    "john london at wlwt",
    "in cincinnati john hi governor the",
    "the number of cases are now almost five",
    "times uh what they were not long ago",
    "thirteen thousand in the last three days",
    "and you told on",
    "our molly larry yesterday you're not",
    "going to cry wolf and say there's an",
    "emergency",
    "uh when there's not but that the trend",
    "lines are not good you got 2075 in the",
    "hospital now",
    "can you quantify for us when you hit",
    "emergency",
    "and given the rule spread if you must",
    "eventually",
    "issue an order would it be statewide or",
    "would it be piecemealed",
    "by region well",
    "john i don't really know we've tried to",
    "do everything",
    "uniform and we have done that",
    "pretty much the spread now as you saw",
    "from the data is",
    "throughout the state so there's there's",
    "no place where this virus",
    "isn't at a high level that's a shocking",
    "thought",
    "but there's no place where this virus is",
    "not at a high level",
    "so in all likelihood when we start",
    "seeing",
    "our hospitals fill up it's not just",
    "going to be one place or two places it's",
    "going to be happening",
    "all over the state of ohio now it may be",
    "you know off",
    "by some days it may hit here one day and",
    "then five days later hit somewhere else",
    "so in all likelihood",
    "you know the orders that we will have to",
    "implement",
    "when it really gets dire will be uniform",
    "throughout the state of ohio",
    "next question is from jen smola at the",
    "columbus dispatch",
    "hi governor um we're seeing in line with",
    "other state trends that cases among",
    "long-term care facility residents and",
    "staff are increasing as well",
    "staff it looks like record number of",
    "cases this week",
    "and among residents they're approaching",
    "records as well",
    "can you share it all what state",
    "officials are looking at in those",
    "facilities and with our most vulnerable",
    "and what measures if any are being",
    "considered to help address",
    "um the the surge in those areas sure",
    "absolutely first your observation is",
    "absolutely correct",
    "uh this should not be a surprise when",
    "we see spread in community that spread",
    "ends up in nursing homes",
    "uh the more spread there is the more",
    "likely it is so it goes back to what",
    "i've said",
    "to to anybody out there who's watching",
    "this who doesn't think",
    "them getting coveted matters",
    "it's just about me it's not about you",
    "because when you get it you can spread",
    "it and many times you get it and you",
    "don't even know it you spread it",
    "and the more it spreads in the community",
    "the more likely",
    "it is that it gets into a nursing home",
    "so the way we protect our grandparents",
    "our great-grandparents",
    "whose our loved ones who are in nursing",
    "homes is to",
    "slow the spread down so",
    "jen you're absolutely right about what's",
    "going on",
    "cases are increasing spread is going up",
    "cases are",
    "going in much faster rate into our",
    "nursing homes",
    "so what are we doing uh we are surging",
    "in",
    "a lot more testing we are using both the",
    "antigen tests that we got from the white",
    "house we are also using",
    "traditional pcr tests were altering",
    "alternating them we are also",
    "looking at or doing a surge and so we're",
    "picking up the cdc the",
    "or the guidelines from the white house",
    "in regard to testing",
    "which are very extensive guidelines",
    "we're following those",
    "on on a personnel basis i've told our",
    "team",
    "that and this is the most important",
    "thing we can do is protect lives",
    "and so we must protect our most",
    "vulnerable and some of our most",
    "vulnerable are those who are living",
    "in in nursing homes i i also",
    "and ursel mcelroy uh has given been",
    "given an enhanced role",
    "uh in in regard to this and and she",
    "knows",
    "she and i've talked about this almost",
    "every day about how very important this",
    "is and she feel feels passionately about",
    "it as well so we're going to continue to",
    "work with our",
    "nursing home homes uh in in regard to",
    "that and we'll have more more",
    "information coming but when we talk",
    "about",
    "our most vulnerable when we get the",
    "vaccine",
    "doesn't help us now but when we get the",
    "vaccine it's going to go into the",
    "nursing homes for",
    "those staff members we will start with",
    "the staff members because that's where",
    "we can put basically a a wall",
    "around our most vulnerable people so we",
    "start with the staff members",
    "then we go in and you know do those once",
    "we get more",
    "then we go in and do the people who are",
    "in the nursing homes themselves who are",
    "the residents of the nursing home",
    "but you know we have vulnerable people",
    "out there",
    "and it's not just those in nursing homes",
    "and i want everyone to remember",
    "this you know when you have if you",
    "pick this virus up and if you're living",
    "in a multi-generational family",
    "if you've got grandmother living with",
    "you then you've got to be exceedingly",
    "careful",
    "about that we have a number of children",
    "in ohio",
    "students who are living with their",
    "grandparents",
    "some 50 60 70 years old and so again",
    "we worry about that so it's that",
    "vulnerable population that",
    "you know we're going to continue to to",
    "focus on as we",
    "you know work to drive down spread in in",
    "the community",
    "thank you next question is from susan",
    "kratzer at hannah news service",

    "behavior",
    "at what point do you plan to step in",
    "well let's talk about that for a moment",
    "we've learned a lot during this pandemic",
    "one thing that we've learned is that",
    "mass really work",
    "one of the ways we know that is because",
    "we're watching what's happening in our",
    "schools",
    "it's not that we don't have virus in our",
    "schools we do",
    "but by and large it is not being spread",
    "in the classroom",
    "and the reason it's not being spread in",
    "the classroom is because students are",
    "wearing a mask",
    "generally uh in regard to",
    "business most businesses are doing a",
    "good job",
    "and requiring all employees to wear",
    "masks",
    "that's good um and that's very very",
    "important so it does",
    "still come down to so much of this",
    "is personal responsibility and so much",
    "of this",
    "is areas where the government cannot",
    "really",
    "impact what people do",
    "i read you some of the examples people",
    "decide to have a party",
    "and they're in a in your own little",
    "group and that's fine then you've got",
    "another party that comes over",
    "people who are not in that group and",
    "then they're mixing and so",
    "you know you see that that",
    "a lot of these areas are not things that",
    "we have the ability to control",
    "but so so much of this comes down",
    "the most power is not in my hands the",
    "most power is in the hands of",
    "every citizen in the state of ohio and",
    "that's why as this spreads",
    "and if you start seeing friends who get",
    "sick and you start seeing",
    "friends who were in the hospital i",
    "talked to a friend of mine had no idea",
    "uh across the state and had no idea that",
    "he had the virus and",
    "talked to him last night he's not in the",
    "hospital but not feeling too good",
    "so each one of us fran and i have had at",
    "least two",
    "uh close friends who have died uh",
    "of the covert so as it starts to impact",
    "more and more people particularly our",
    "rural areas that have been spared",
    "i do believe that people will understand",
    "the urgency of this and that we'll start",
    "seeing more wearing a mask",
    "and more distancing and more",
    "smart decisions being made but there are",
    "some things",
    "that you know we're looking at doing not",
    "going to talk about them today",
    "but we'll have those in the not too",
    "distant future we're going to do what we",
    "can do",
    "wherever we can have make an impact",
    "because the number one threat",
    "not only to lives in the state of ohio",
    "but the number one",
    "threat to people working being able to",
    "support their family",
    "economy moving forward is this virus",
    "this virus is starting to flare up",
    "and is flaring up we've got to push it",
    "down",
    "if we don't push it down people will",
    "lose confidence",
    "in their ability to go out they'll lose",
    "confidence and",
    "ability to go to stores to get groceries",
    "to go to restaurants and when that",
    "happens",
    "it doesn't matter what i order people",
    "stop going",
    "and so if we want to continue uh",
    "to try to live through this pandemic and",
    "live with this virus for the next few",
    "months we have got to",
    "be wearing masks and being more careful",
    "but i will have",
    "other things coming shortly",
    "next question is from dan derose at",
    "w-o-i-o in cleveland",
    "good afternoon governor how are you",
    "today i'm good",
    "governor i remember quite a few months",
    "back uh when businesses",
    "opened back up on clubs and bars and",
    "restaurants and",
    "every once in a while you would give us",
    "one of the anecdotes uh about maybe an",
    "eagle's lodge or an",
    "elks lodge that had an outbreak uh",
    "recently the only uh scenarios you give",
    "us are",
    "weddings funerals today's halloween",
    "party uh",
    "analogy are you protecting businesses",
    "and therefore protecting the economy by",
    "not giving us",
    "if there's been a outbreak at a bar or",
    "restaurant",
    "or is it not happening it seems",
    "illogical to think that we haven't had",
    "an outbreak",
    "or a spread in any bar or restaurant",
    "well",
    "first of all thank you for the question",
    "the answer is no i'm not",
    "um i think people should know by now i",
    "call it like i see it and",
    "whether people like it or not but",
    "i'm reporting what our health directors",
    "are telling us",
    "now you mentioned fraternal lodges",
    "we've seen some horrible cases come out",
    "of",
    "of fraternal lodges we've had a",
    "situation where the local health",
    "department",
    "asked some lodges to literally shut down",
    "so no and i i thought we had talked",
    "about that but",
    "maybe i didn't but so we've definitely",
    "seen some cases like that",
    "we are citing and we publish it every",
    "week",
    "when our agents are out and go into a",
    "bar and people are intermixing",
    "too closely and the distancing is not",
    "being observed we",
    "sight those bars and so you can look at",
    "those bars that have been sighted",
    "uh and give you a pretty good indication",
    "of a place where in all likelihood",
    "um you're seeing spread now um",
    "we we do have bar cases and we do have",
    "restaurant cases",
    "but what's happening is as we",
    "move forward and as you see this",
    "the map that we had up here a few",
    "minutes ago just turn red all over and",
    "we're seeing",
    "all high incidence counties not another",
    "one not high incidence",
    "we're seeing many times where the local",
    "contact tracers",
    "people who are on the phone when",
    "somebody gets sick",
    "and the person really doesn't know where",
    "they got it and that's",
    "that's a function of very widespread",
    "coveted in the local community and so",
    "probably more and more cases where they",
    "can't can't",
    "you know they're at eight places and so",
    "the so the contact tracer will list",
    "eight different places down there but",
    "the person doesn't know really where",
    "they get it",
    "now when you see where you can tell",
    "where it is is the big spreaders",
    "where you see the big spreads then you",
    "can kind of reverse engineer",
    "and do the detective work and go back",
    "and see that and so the big spreaders",
    "sort of by their nature i guess have",
    "been big events like weddings and in",
    "funerals",
    "um where we've seen the big spread but",
    "uh i will go back",
    "and uh you know my team's watching this",
    "so we'll go back and we'll",
    "we'll look and see how you know what",
    "we're seeing but",
    "but many times that person might be at a",
    "bar one night",
    "they might be playing cards with their",
    "friends the next night",
    "they may be at work during the day and",
    "so you got",
    "seven or eight different choices and you",
    "don't know",
    "you know that contact tracer at the",
    "local level just can't figure out and",
    "nor can that person figure out where",
    "they really got it",
    "and you hear more and more of them my",
    "friend who i was talking to the other",
    "day said i have no idea where i got it",
    "we've been very careful but i don't have",
    "a clue really where i got it",
    "for sure i got guesses but i'm not sure",
    "john",
    "yeah governor i i would say that for",
    "example we know that",
    "the health the health department in",
    "muskingum county had issues with",
    "uh fraternal fraternal organizations",
    "where they saw the spread",
    "they went to the fraternal organizations",
    "they asked them to close down",
    "uh temporarily and they did so a lot of",
    "times we get a",
    "get very good cooperation when those",
    "kinds of things happen",
    "and i think the the reason that we point",
    "this out is because",
    "in businesses there is a mask",
    "requirement in most settings that we're",
    "talking about schools where the mast",
    "requirement",
    "is in place and we see people following",
    "it we tend not to see",
    "the problems that we see in the informal",
    "settings when people let their guard",
    "down and they don't wear the masks they",
    "don't practice the social",
    "distancing and it's not that it doesn't",
    "have happen in business but the spread",
    "and the and the problem where we have",
    "look we don't have a way to touch people",
    "in their personal lives at their homes",
    "in their in their family or friend",
    "settings other than",
    "for them to take ownership of it and",
    "that's why we emphasize that because",
    "they that's not something where we can",
    "impose a mask mandate on them they have",
    "to",
    "they have to take this own it exercise",
    "that personal responsibility and",
    "accountability",
    "to help us get this back under control",
    "next question is from laura caso at wkyc",
    "in cleveland hi governor thanks so much",
    "i'm just expanding on another question",
    "you know i understand that you're saying",
    "that",
    "masks work uh the power isn't your in",
    "your hands but",
    "you know we all know there are cities",
    "across the country pulling back",
    "considering closing businesses",
    "imposing curfews just any changes to",
    "make uh",
    "you know the spike stop why not now in",
    "ohio",
    "you know why not mention or at least",
    "give us some uh",
    "information about what we could see you",
    "know next week or in the next few days",
    "with almost 5 000 cases a day",
    "anything you can tell us about what's",
    "next",
    "no i mean we're we're looking at this",
    "and",
    "the parts that things that we can",
    "control",
    "you know we have done we have put a mass",
    "order on in schools",
    "therefore we're not seeing it much",
    "spread in schools",
    "we put a mass order on in business",
    "those businesses that comply most do",
    "we're not seeing much spread",
    "time after time you know when you delve",
    "into it",
    "you see that the spread is occurring",
    "outside of the business and outside of",
    "the school",
    "so in the areas that we have been able",
    "to put a mass order on and",
    "actually enforce it we have been able to",
    "see great results",
    "where we put a mass order on and we have",
    "difficulty enforcing it",
    "uh we are not seeing the re the same",
    "results",
    "and so we're we're examining that and",
    "trying to see",
    "okay what else can we do to enforce mass",
    "quarters",
    "what else can we do to impact people in",
    "their private lives",
    "but again when you get into people's",
    "private lives you have decisions that",
    "are made by people",
    "using their judgment using their free",
    "will",
    "and you know my obligation principal",
    "obligation is to make sure",
    "everybody in ohio to the best of my",
    "ability we do it through",
    "advertising we do it through this press",
    "conference we do it any way i can",
    "uh everybody in ohio understands the",
    "gravity of what we are seeing",
    "you know so we flew around the state it",
    "was in every",
    "virtually every media market to talk",
    "directly to the people",
    "so giving them that information uh the",
    "information that we're putting out today",
    "anybody who looks at it should be scared",
    "to death about it",
    "this should scare you that you have this",
    "much spread",
    "in your hometown because",
    "there's nobody's hometown that doesn't",
    "have this spread",
    "so again part of my job is to let people",
    "know",
    "exactly where where we are",
    "let's hopefully we hope that citizens",
    "will take that",
    "information and understand the gravity",
    "of what they are seeing",
    "this has never gone up you know this",
    "fast",
    "it has just skyrocketed from a thousand",
    "cases to close to you know five thousand",
    "cases",
    "so it's uh but but again it comes back",
    "to people's individual decisions",
    "that we can't a lot of this we can't",
    "micromanage and we can't control",
    "but the public can people can",
    "next question is from jeff redick at",
    "wsyx in columbus",
    "governor uh two quick things first off i",
    "think about four questions ago",
    "you were talking about possibility of",
    "issuing orders you said but i will have",
    "other things coming shortly",
    "could you expand on that no second",
    "okay no but you can ask the other",
    "questions",
    "uh second um the new uh",
    "administrative lead of uh ohio",
    "department of health just for from a",
    "forward-facing aspect",
    "what are ohioans going to see you know",
    "is bruce vanderhoff going to address",
    "people like amy acton did who's got your",
    "ear of",
    "of kind of the two chiefs there is",
    "stephanie mcleod more of a budget side",
    "person how does that all work",
    "no they both have my ear they're both",
    "intimately involved in what we do",
    "stephanie has been intimately involved",
    "for some time in what we're doing in",
    "this pandemic effort",
    "she's been involved at least for two",
    "months um on",
    "in our meetings conference calls she's",
    "been carrying",
    "two jobs and now she's just going to",
    "focus on the one job and i'm very happy",
    "to have",
    "her she's a phenomenal administrator",
    "so much of what this pandemic response",
    "is is logistics",
    "carrying it out that's why we've got you",
    "know one of the reasons we've got",
    "general harris",
    "so much involved in the national guard",
    "um",
    "you know a lot a lot of balls in the air",
    "a lot of moving parts and particularly",
    "and that will increase when we go to the",
    "to the uh just",
    "distribution uh of the vaccine",
    "uh as far as dr vanderhoff um",
    "look he's someone i trust someone who's",
    "been our advisor before",
    "it's going to be great to have him",
    "always on the calls",
    "it's going to be great to have him at",
    "every meeting he's going to be",
    "chief chief medical advisor for me as we",
    "move forward",
    "next question is from jackie borchardt",
    "at the cincinnati enquirer",
    "good afternoon governor um",
    "your predecessor chose a non-position to",
    "lead the health department",
    "you had said it was important to you to",
    "have a doctor in that role",
    "and now it seems like we're going back",
    "to the",
    "kind of hybrid model do you regret your",
    "first approach and if not why why change",
    "it up now",
    "well we're at a different stage this is",
    "the most dangerous",
    "stage we are we've been at uh during",
    "this pandemic",
    "and you know i need a person who can",
    "focus on",
    "administration making things run",
    "uh getting vaccine out",
    "but doing all the other things that need",
    "to be done",
    "making sure that we've got the personnel",
    "at the local level",
    "making sure we got the personnel at the",
    "state level so in stephanie mcleod",
    "i have someone who i have a great deal",
    "of confidence in i've known her for many",
    "years",
    "she's a superb administrator uh she will",
    "do what needs to be done every single",
    "day and",
    "working for me is not easy as anybody",
    "can tell you",
    "uh we're very focused on getting results",
    "uh she'll get the results um",
    "you know dr vanderhoff again",
    "you know he's going to be my chief",
    "advisor on medical issues",
    "uh he's going to be with me every step",
    "of the way so i think it's a great team",
    "and we were purposeful today to tell you",
    "about some of the other",
    "senior team members uh because",
    "they are very important and they play an",
    "integral part in what we do",
    "every single day and what we're going to",
    "do going forward",
    "so i think it's a good team i think it's",
    "the right combination",
    "we've been careful",
    "in regard to who we selected for this",
    "job",
    "these two jobs and we're very happy with",
    "with where we are um i'm trying to think",
    "john husted of a good sports analogy but",
    "uh",
    "uh you know it's uh i'm",
    "i'm kind of a baseball guy and so it's",
    "you know",
    "mid mid season and you bring in uh you",
    "get another pitcher you had another",
    "pitcher and you",
    "had another catcher or you had another",
    "outfielder you know position player or",
    "something and you know",
    "we're pouring really good people into",
    "this team",
    "so people who have been there so far",
    "have done a phenomenal job",
    "but it's time to step it up even more",
    "and that's what we're doing",
    "a quick follow-up um do either of them",
    "have infectious disease",
    "experience we'll have to ask him",
    "what his infectious disease experience",
    "doctor you it's still on there i sure am",
    "well at ohio health as you can imagine",
    "uh all the",
    "infectious disease work reports up to me",
    "and i work very very closely with our id",
    "specialists",
    "i am very very confident not only",
    "in my ability to connect with the",
    "infectious disease experts around the",
    "state of ohio but also",
    "around the nation and my my own",
    "medical background means that i feel",
    "very comfortable",
    "in interpreting not only their guidance",
    "but also the medical literature",
    "thank you thank you very much next",
    "question is from ben schwartz at wcpo",
    "in cincinnati hey ben hi governor",
    "um can you speak about how ohio did on",
    "tuesday",
    "in terms of keeping voters safe from",
    "covet 19.",
    "do you believe the state kept election",
    "day in-person voters",
    "as safe as possible thank you well thank",
    "you thank you for giving me that",
    "opportunity",
    "something i was going to say and and and",
    "neglected to say",
    "and that is i think ohio's election",
    "was run exceedingly well",
    "frank larose as secretary of state is in",
    "a long",
    "tradition of republican and democrat",
    "secretaries of state",
    "who have done exceedingly well and run",
    "the state elections",
    "very very well but we also",
    "must mention that this is done on a",
    "bipartisan",
    "way and it's done at the county level",
    "with the county boards",
    "of elections democrats and republicans",
    "and then it's done down at the precinct",
    "level so to every person who worked the",
    "polls",
    "to make sure that votes were counted",
    "correctly that were everything happened",
    "the people knew where to go",
    "uh so that they were safe uh they were",
    "recorded quite correctly",
    "uh and that they were protected thank",
    "you",
    "as governor of ohio i am very grateful",
    "for what each and every one of you did",
    "it was a long day i'm sure but i think",
    "you did a phenomenal job i think ohio",
    "did a phenomenal job",
    "under very difficult circumstances",
    "because during the pandemic",
    "next question is from laura hancock at",
    "cleveland.com",
    "good afternoon governor i was just",
    "wondering um",
    "with the um president trump he's",
    "claiming that he won pennsylvania",
    "and he has won the overall election",
    "before all the votes have been counted",
    "what is your take on this",
    "well i think it's important",
    "uh and these are you know",
    "kind of tension-filled days i think for",
    "people not only because the pandemic but",
    "because we",
    "whenever you have uncertainty there's",
    "some extra tension",
    "and the uncertainty forces in regard to",
    "the presidential campaign or",
    "the election but i think it's important",
    "for us as ohioans and americans to",
    "remember",
    "that we've done this before we've done",
    "this for over 200 years",
    "we've done it better than about anybody",
    "or maybe anybody",
    "throughout the history of mankind",
    "we do it exceedingly well we have",
    "if there's transition of power we do",
    "that well",
    "and we have a long tradition",
    "of counting all the votes we have a long",
    "tradition",
    "of respect for the law so",
    "the votes are continuing to be counted i",
    "i'm happy that",
    "you know we're not seeing ohio",
    "spotlighted is still counting you know a",
    "whole bunch of votes",
    "but those votes are getting counted in",
    "these other states",
    "people are doing the best job that they",
    "can as as they count these votes",
    "at the same time we should not be upset",
    "that a candidate decides to file a",
    "lawsuit every presidential campaign that",
    "i've been associated with",
    "uh in ohio has had lawyers",
    "on the ready to file a lawsuit and the",
    "other side has",
    "as well so the fact that a lawsuit is",
    "filed",
    "we just need to you know say that",
    "hey let's let's trust the system let's",
    "trust the courts",
    "let's trust the the process that we've",
    "had over 200 years of building up and",
    "following",
    "so i have great confidence this is all",
    "going to work",
    "we're going to have a winner we're going",
    "to have someone who's going to become",
    "the next president",
    "of the base and i just think it is",
    "important for us to",
    "respect both sides uh and",
    "and to understand that after this is",
    "over with the counting's done",
    "after somebody is uh you know is the",
    "president then",
    "we will we will move on and",
    "uh for ohioans my particular plea is",
    "you know once this is over with and",
    "we're focused on that let's get back to",
    "focusing on",
    "you know what we have to and and getting",
    "down to get this virus down and being",
    "able to",
    "uh you know live with this virus until",
    "we get",
    "till we get the vaccine but live with it",
    "in a safe way",
    "next question is from kevin landers at",
    "wbns",
    "good afternoon governor both you and uh",
    "lance",
    "himes today both talked about a vaccine",
    "is coming can you give us any any",
    "indication",
    "if you've been told uh whether that",
    "vaccine will come before the end of this",
    "year",
    "and secondly a month ago ohio's are not",
    "number was less than",
    "one today it's 1.21 rhode island has the",
    "exact same r naught number as we do and",
    "the governor there has",
    "reduced a limit on social gatherings to",
    "10 people instructed hospitals and",
    "nursing homes to scale back visitations",
    "bands spectators with sporting events",
    "for two weeks",
    "and shut down indoor athletic facilities",
    "for one week are any of those",
    "options that rhode island has done on",
    "your table or off the table can you give",
    "us",
    "any indication yeah look we are we",
    "already have",
    "a limit at 10 people we already have a",
    "state",
    "a statewide mass quarter um",
    "so we have those two things that have",
    "that have been in place",
    "and and remain in in place um",
    "you know look we're constantly reviewing",
    "what we need to do",
    "nothing is off the table let me make it",
    "very clear nothing is off the table",
    "you know i am as concerned as anybody is",
    "in the state about what we're seeing",
    "and but we want to be you know surgical",
    "in what we're doing",
    "so that we know what we're doing does",
    "have does have an impact we also know",
    "that when you start moving to shutdowns",
    "that there are other ramifications and",
    "there are other",
    "downsides and what i found as governor",
    "throughout this pandemic",
    "is that there are very rarely",
    "do you have a choice that's good bad",
    "that's pretty easy you don't have that",
    "what you have is bad and worse",
    "and then you got to figure out which is",
    "which so",
    "you know anytime you start shutting",
    "things down",
    "not i'm not saying i won't do that but",
    "you know there are consequences their",
    "mental health consequences their",
    "economic consequences",
    "schools for example you know look",
    "at the beginning of this we did not",
    "understand the that mask",
    "would be so powerful and we didn't even",
    "fully understand it when school started",
    "back i mean we had pretty good idea",
    "but now we've got really pretty what",
    "would appear to be pretty strong",
    "evidence that there's not much",
    "spread directly in school and so",
    "normally you'd say well shut down",
    "schools",
    "well but we're not seeing that much",
    "spread in schools we're seeing",
    "in formal",
    "which are much more difficult to",
    "regulate uh but again",
    "more is coming and uh we'll have more",
    "conversations about this",
    "but the most important thing the people",
    "who have the most control",
    "who have the ability to to shut this",
    "thing down or the people of the state of",
    "ohio",
    "and you know i just hope as they see",
    "these numbers spike",
    "that there's going to be a more",
    "realization of what needs to be done and",
    "i believe from talking to some of the",
    "health",
    "commissioners that we're starting to see",
    "that particularly in our rural counties",
    "that have been untouched before now but",
    "they're really being hit now",
    "this is a follow-up next question from",
    "andrew welsh huggins at the associated",
    "press",
    "hi governor andrew i wanted to ask about",
    "the um",
    "the election results in ohio uh sort of",
    "as they relate to the coronavirus",
    "especially given",
    "today's record-breaking negative",
    "statistics",
    "so given president trump's solid victory",
    "in ohio and",
    "given how much objectively speaking the",
    "two of you have taken",
    "different approaches to battling the",
    "pandemic when it comes to things like",
    "mask wearing and social distancing",
    "to what degree could the results be",
    "interpreted",
    "again given all these record high",
    "numbers as a repudiation by ohioans of",
    "you",
    "and the approach you've taken and the",
    "requests you've made",
    "as governor well that would be kind of",
    "interesting since i not only endorsed",
    "the president but i was",
    "co-chair uh so you know it would be kind",
    "of",
    "strange for someone to walk in and say",
    "i'm going to repudiate mike dewine by",
    "voting for",
    "donald trump i'm sure some people maybe",
    "had that in their mind but",
    "uh it just doesn't to me sound like it",
    "makes a whole lot of sense",
    "um look i i've been asked before i was",
    "asked earlier today in a public forum uh",
    "why you know why did trump do so well in",
    "ohio",
    "and this is just one person's take on it",
    "i think that people you know",
    "voted for donald trump um",
    "they may not like these tweets or other",
    "things but",
    "in the end they felt he had their back",
    "they felt that he",
    "would do battle for them that he was a",
    "fighter my experience in a few decades",
    "in ohio politics",
    "has been that ohio is like a fighter",
    "and it doesn't matter whether it's a",
    "democrat or republican",
    "many times i use the example this",
    "morning of howard metzenbaum howard",
    "messenbaum and",
    "donald trump probably pretty far apart",
    "on a lot of issues",
    "a democrat versus a republican but",
    "metzenbaum was successful in ohio",
    "senator messenbom was",
    "successful in ohio because people looked",
    "at him as a fighter",
    "first and foremost and they felt that he",
    "had their back",
    "and that he was fighting against forces",
    "that no one else was fighting",
    "and i think there's sort of that feeling",
    "in regard to donald trump",
    "that's how i would you know if i had to",
    "describe why i think he won by eight",
    "percentage points in ohio and basically",
    "duplicated what he did four years ago",
    "that's that's what i would say",
    "governor next question is the last",
    "question for today and it belongs to",
    "andy chow",
    "of ohio public radio and television hi",
    "governor",
    "andy uh when it comes to these",
    "informal gatherings uh you've been",
    "asking for",
    "people to stop doing this for a while",
    "now and it just doesn't really seem",
    "to be taking have you considered",
    "maybe a new approach or a new strategy",
    "to handling these gatherings maybe just",
    "increasing public awareness of hey if",
    "you're going to do this",
    "this is how you can do it safely maybe",
    "just",
    "a pivot in some way to get people to",
    "if they're not going to abstain from",
    "gathering then",
    "some sort of way to get them to do it in",
    "a safe way",
    "yes that's that's very good uh i think",
    "it's spot on",
    "uh you know we're gonna come out with",
    "some lists of things",
    "here's how you do certain things and we",
    "don't want to be presumptuous getting",
    "people's lives",
    "but i think people need to know you know",
    "how they can do it a lot safer",
    "and it does come back to something i",
    "have said before",
    "and that is that",
    "we can do most of the things we've",
    "always done",
    "we just have to do them differently and",
    "i've used the example of fran i going",
    "over and seeing our gran",
    "our grandkids we just do it differently",
    "we still see them",
    "and i think that you know it's not",
    "either",
    "or it's not shut the thing off",
    "completely",
    "it's figuring out how to do it and by",
    "and large",
    "the wearing of a mask more dramatically",
    "changes your odds",
    "and it dramatically improves your odds",
    "and when you",
    "and the other person are wearing those",
    "that mask",
    "you really upped your odds or you've",
    "you've made it a lot",
    "more likely that you know even if that",
    "person might be having a virus or you",
    "might have the virus that there will not",
    "will not be the spread but i think",
    "you're right",
    "uh you know we're working on some kind",
    "of lists of how uh how you do this",
    "you know my maybe how you do",
    "thanksgiving how you do this and again",
    "we're not trying to tell people how to",
    "live but",
    "but again i think people need to know",
    "that you know",
    "if you're going to do this and do this",
    "okay your call",
    "but wearing a mask",
    "doing this doing that etc i mean we know",
    "for example",
    "being outside uh you know fran and i",
    "when we've been with family we tried to",
    "do it outside uh",
    "as much as we can outside now it's going",
    "to get colder and",
    "that will end at some point but doing",
    "things outside we know is so much safer",
    "so",
    "we need to take the knowledge that we've",
    "acquired",
    "collectively all of us during the last",
    "few months and then",
    "use that as we make decisions as we as",
    "we move forward",
    "so andy thank you very much",
    "and uh i guess dan says that's the last",
    "question",
    "i look forward to seeing you all next",
    "time we're our next scheduled",
    "uh time is tuesday uh it's possible we",
    "might do something before then",
    "but if not we will see you all on",
    "tuesday thank you",
    "you"
