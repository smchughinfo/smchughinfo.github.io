one other note on q as we noted
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
this has been a interesting
day for the dewine family i left
right here in cedarville i left home at
about six o'clock this morning and drove
to cleveland
and the idea was i was going to get
tested which i did
everyone who sees the president is
tested so
i was i was tested i went from there to
the the airport
and when i got to the airport found out
shortly thereafter that i had tested
positive
so that was a big a big surprise uh
obviously could not see the president
and i could not greet the president it
had been my intention to be there to to
greet him when he
flew into into cleveland uh
called fran and uh headed
headed back and uh stopped in in
columbus uh
and fran and i and some of the people
who
worked very very closely uh with me
were tested it was not a rapid test so
we don't do not have the test back
yet but you know i feel fine
have a headache but uh you know i
i i get a lot of headaches throughout my
life so
a headache is not anything that unusual
so
besides that i i feel well so um
a big surprise to me and certainly a big
surprise to our family
when i found out i called fran and i
called each of our
seven children because i figured the
news would be out pretty quickly so i
want them to hear that
directly from me and i was able to reach
all of them
and so here we are friend i just got
back
here uh in cedarville i guess about a
half an hour ago
so more than happy to take any any
questions
just a reminder for reporters you will
remain on mute uh
until your question is called uh if you
wish to ask a question
please mention so in the zoom chat
governor our first question will be from
kevin landers at wbns 10 tv in columbus
hello governor can you hear me kevin
i can i can hear you well kevin thank
you very
very good i hope you're doing well thank
you so much for taking the time
um governor do you have any idea where
you may have
contacted this virus and considering
your age
what have doctors told you about your
recovery from it thank you
well they haven't told me anything but
i've read enough about it
uh you know just have some idea what
what we're dealing with
uh so we've not had any discussion with
any doctor about
about that um uh
you know so where where did i get it
i have no idea um you know
you're watching me on the front porch uh
at our home home that we've lived in
since 1974.
um and uh you know we i
basically since uh the virus came
on since we started dealing with the
coronavirus in march
fran and i have lived out of here we
were living out here every week
during the weekend but we left the
governor's residence we came here
we have a farm that goes down that way
so
you know we're very very careful with
with who we see uh we have two daughters
that live down the road
we have four grandchildren uh but you
know even with them
uh you know we were a mask uh we walk
down there
uh we keep our distance uh both our both
our daughters
are are pregnant uh expecting babies and
we're very excited about that
uh but we you know we keep our distance
there uh as far as our office
um you know there's really four people
down that way
i see these four people only uh on
tuesdays and thursdays
or eric who's behind the camera who you
hear me always talking about he's also
behind the camera today he was also
tested today
you know i'll see him if we do a remote
tv shot we did
cuomo last night cnn we did it from
right in here in the house and uh you
know he was there so
with those four people uh
that's really about about it um
and uh you know we i bear
uh
well we've got a little uh pause here i
guess
whoever has the next question the next
question
is from jason uh lg uh at usa today uh
jason please want me to ask your
question
hi governor thanks for taking the time
to speak with us
uh have you been getting tested
regularly before now
as a matter of uh your government's
protocol
what does testing look like for you
other than when you publicly
demonstrated a test in june
and in preparation for the president's
visit today
that's the only other test i've had so
as of right now i've had three tests two
today and
and that one that we did did publicly
that was it
i mean i had no symptoms uh you know i
had no indication that
no reason to think i had the coca-19 so
i've not done any other testing
our next question is uh from uh farnesha
miri at the associated press
hi governor thanks for taking the time
today
um what message do you hope that
that this sends to ohions i mean you're
someone who has
um very uh very
publicly worn a mask and advocated for
masks
and social and like you said you have
not left your residence you've avoided a
lot of public
gatherings even when the vice president
was in town
um last month so what does it
does this kind of say to ohioans or to
the american public that someone who
took all the precautions
still got well it's
it's you know nothing really new
i mean it's what we've said and what the
experts have said
uh and that is that it's uh you know
very contagious
uh it is here it lives among us um
you know we know you're always simply
dealing with trying to improve your odds
and
when you wear a mask you're improving
yards odds dramatically
but that does not mean you you won't get
it uh you restrict the number of people
you see
that improves your odds dramatically but
it simply does not mean that
you know there's no guarantees there's
no guarantees in life
uh so you know i don't think people
should read a whole lot
uh a lot into this uh it is uh
other than what we already know which is
this is a very dangerous
uh you know and it's very contagious
governor your next question is from
origins of spectrum news
here we go good afternoon governor first
of all i want to wish you well i hope
you
uh recover quickly i want to ask
about the test what type of test was it
that you took that gave you the results
so quickly and i'm curious how available
those tests are
uh you know this was a test uh
that was arranged by the white house and
frankly that's all i know
i really did not ask i didn't think much
about it uh the protocol
of course is i you know i had at one
point i had
uh an appointment to see the president
uh in washington
uh they explained that i would get a
test right then they'd get the results
back and then i would be able to go see
the president we
that did not take place the meeting did
not take place i think we had some
conflict
uh but so i don't know i mean it's
obviously it's a rapid test i mean
they got the results back right away uh
but beyond that
i can't tell you i'm sure the white
house can you know can tell you exactly
what the test was i don't know
our next question is from laura caso of
wwkyc in cleveland
hi governor i'm glad to see you are
doing well i do have a question uh
social media kind of going crazy right
now a lot of people saying
uh this is an example of why i don't
need to wear a mask
i thought masks worked what would you
say to those people who are now
doubting um that whether or not they
should wear a mask since clearly
you have been wearing one
well i've already got a few texts um you
know not so nice text
uh from people uh about about that it's
sort of
you know we told you this was all fake
and uh you know we told you that we're
in mass didn't matter
but look we know it we know it does uh
if people you know take
that lesson from the fact that i
apparently haven't uh that would be the
wrong lesson
it would be very very sad and that would
that will will upset me quite a bit
uh because that's not the lesson that
should come from this
uh you know the lesson should come from
this is that we're all human
uh this virus is everywhere uh this
virus is very tough
um and yes you can contract it even when
you're being very very careful and even
when you're wearing a mask
but uh your odds are just dramatically
better
and uh my odds obviously you know
weren't good that day that i contracted
and and you know there's some things
that are out of our control
but um you know i've had some
people in the past of you know mention
of god and that
we god and i i kind of go back to
what my wife fran always has said uh as
long as i've known her
uh and that is you know god helps those
who help themselves and so
you know you try and you you do those
things and usually
uh you know we know it improves your
odds it improves your opera
your chances of not getting it or
decreases the chances that you get it
but there's nothing certain in life and
you know
that's it's uh it's it's not
uh there's just no guarantees in life
our next question is from matt wright of
wjw in cleveland
hi governor can you please tell us
exactly where and when you were tested
here in the cleveland area today
and then also on the second test you had
have you received those results
and if so what's the result no this was
not the
second test was not a rapid test so
we've not received those uh
results yet uh would not expect to for a
while
uh you know they said we might get those
later tonight
but i don't i don't know you know we
didn't expect to have them back this
soon
at all as far as location the test i was
not driving the highway patrol was
driving and quite candidly i didn't even
look to see where we were
i was uh answering emails and on the
phone
and paid no attention i got out i got
the test i got back in the car and
started working again so i'm sure that
uh you know we can supply that
information uh for you it was a place
where testing was occurring
um and you know it was public testing
that day
our next question is from andrew tobias
at cleveland.com
hi governor uh my question are uh
why lieutenant governor john husted
continued with the event today if you're
concerned that he was exposed and then
also generally i was hoping that you
could address
how you envision this may affect the
functionings of state government
well john was tested too and john john
uh you know
it was not it was a negative test for
him so there would be no reason for him
not to
not to move forward i guess i'd you know
um
look i mean i'm going to continue uh you
know
i'll be quarantined for at least 14 days
see how this goes uh but uh anybody
knows me
knows that i'm going to continue to
do what i do so um
you know i'm spend most days right here
anyway
and uh you know i'm on the phone a lot
uh
i'm on uh conference call a lot
and um so you know
so far my work is not going to be
impacted we'll we'll
obviously we'll see you know i don't
take anything for granted and uh
this virus is is a nasty thing uh we we
know that
it impacts some people one way and some
people another way some people are much
worse
you know we fully fully realize that
so we'll see but you know
john uh houston the lieutenant governor
has been
intimately involved in everything we do
he and i are on the phone every day
i i don't know how many times but you
know some days six seven eight times
so that process everything's just going
to continue until
you know unless for some reason it
cannot
our next question is from marty
schleyden at the ohio capitol journal
good afternoon governor good afternoon
hope your
case is one of the asymptomatic ones
thank you
um so a lot of the nasty
social media traffic uh seems to be
predicated on the assumption that
one wears a mask to keep from getting
the virus
it's my understanding that cloth masks
are more intended to keep from
giving others the virus would you talk
about what you understand from your
health experts about that
well the experts have told me that you
wear a mask primarily to protect others
there is some evidence and look they
continue to learn about the spread
but there's some evidence that it has
some benefit to you as well
you know basically everybody i've been
around has had a mask on
uh and i've had a mask on and that's
kind of been our protocol
so um you know going back to
five questions ago i don't know where i
got it
uh you know we've kind of replayed
through uh you know where that could
have occurred and we just don't frankly
we just
can't figure it out now you know
everybody around me was
who as i said the kind of the people
that are in my bubble were tested today
uh it's not a very big group uh it's the
highway patrol
uh those people who are assigned
directly to me uh
and who would be in the same car with me
uh you know there is a
uh because of the virus we installed
there's a shield
now between the the front and back
that's
not what we had before but uh what we
have now
so you know with the highway patrol uh
also
um you know with as i said the people
sort of in the bubble the four or five
people that are in the bubble
uh that i interact with in in the office
obviously i'm with fran uh fran's
brother is here
uh some i don't interact with with her
brother john but
uh so you know trying to rack our brain
try to figure it out we haven't really
figured it out
you know i think when we get the test
back and we get results from other
people that may give us some indication
governor your next question is from john
london at wlwt in cincinnati
hi john
john can you unbeat your line please
he had to leave for a live shot okay uh
curtis you can you may ask his question
uh sure um
he was going to ask um what more the
state can do
so the average ohioan can get a result
like he did
today um and how confident is he about
reliability of rapid tests uh given
percentage of false negative results
well i i think you know i don't have any
more information than anybody else does
about
the reliability i mean that's been
published it's been debated that's been
talked about
we know there are generally false pos
you know false
false negatives usually as i'm was what
i'm told
uh but i don't i don't pretend to be the
expert look
we've done everything that we can and
we're not stopping
to make sure there's more testing
available
you know six weeks ago five weeks ago we
were about 8
000 tests a day we're now averaging
about 22 000 tests a day
but we have things in the works uh
with contracts we announced the other
the other day a joint effort
with maryland uh michigan and other
states uh
to to purchase more
so we're going to continue to do
everything we can to ramp up testing in
in the state of ohio you know one of the
things that
we're going to do in fact i was on the
phone
i was going to talk to the president
about today is pooling
white house has been urging pooling for
some time
uh in conversations and so we're working
to be able to
you know do that pooling so that you can
speed the testing up not the results
that you get back but you can do more
tests uh and so you put you know four or
five tests or maybe ten tests
uh in and you run them if they're all
negative if it comes back negative it's
negative everybody clears out
uh so you know we're working on that and
and
to do to do more of that so
you know the other two tests i've taken
has been the standard test uh
the one that the white house provided
today uh was the only rapid test that
that i've taken
governor your next question is from jack
windsor at wmfd in mansfield
hey jack how you doing hi governor i'm
well uh
my daughter and i are praying for your
good health sir thank you so much
yes sir uh this will dovetail the last
question a bit
uh since this was a rapid test if this
does come back as a false positive
uh does this give you pause to continue
with the ramping
of the rapid testing program you spoke
about on tuesday particularly as it
relates to
you know if there's a fault or a false
positive in a school or on a sports team
it could really
shut things down or um do you just feel
like
we have to go forward because of the raw
number of tests you feel like we need to
do
well jack we're going forward with all
kinds of different
tests and and you know going forward
pushing the rapid test but we're also
doing
you know the other the other more
conventional tests
uh look i i think that you know
is a is a constant re-evaluation
um of everything uh
we constantly evaluate where we are
with the virus what we know about the
virus we know more and i don't mean me
i'm not a scientist but i mean
collectively we know more about uh
the virus today than we did in march uh
same way with testing and you know the
testing is evolving
so um i'm not gonna prejudge we'll see
what
what uh happens i'm i'm sort of hoping
that uh
you know it was a false test but i don't
i certainly don't assume that and i i
i assume that it was a correct test but
we'll
you know we'll we'll see and when when i
get my results back and friend gets her
results back we'll
we'll certainly share those with
everybody thank you sir
governor your next question is from
jackie borchardt the cincinnati enquirer
hi jackie hi uh glad to hear that you're
doing well
um i also have a follow-up on the rapid
test as your case is
unique compared to most ohioans and that
you were able to get a result in the
same day
and quarantine without coming into
contact with additional people
the white house has been using these
kinds of tests since april
should the federal government have done
more or could you have done more at the
state level to make that testing more
widely available here i don't speak for
the white house i'll speak for me
uh look we will look back on this
uh i'm sure and there'll be things that
we look back and say gee wish we'd done
that i wish we'd done this
all i can tell you is that we have
pushed as hard as i know how to get more
testing
and it has been a problem but uh you
know
again we're at 22 000 tests on an
average today
uh it's a lot better than we were we got
double it and then we got double it
again
uh so you know that's been my message as
i've talked to um
you know senator portman senator brown
whether i talk to the white house vice
president
you know any help you can give us in the
funding of testing
because you know the private sector is
moving uh things are happening
and uh there's going to be more and more
tests available
and if if we have the money to pay for
it um
and we've set aside a lot of money a lot
of the karazhak dollars we we've set
aside for
for testing not just for this month but
in the in the coming months
but that's what we have to do we have to
do more and more testing and you're
right
the faster you get the test back the
more you the quicker you can make a
decision
or or you know to you know that you the
person needs to isolate
uh and then you can move you you move
forward so yeah we need them quicker
uh and we need more of them but um you
know we
we put a full court press on uh for a
long time
on this and some of this is taking
longer
but as i said driving to cleveland this
morning i spent
i don't know a couple hours on the phone
talking about testing
and you know what else we can do where
we can go and what the progress
is there's a lot of balls in the air a
lot of things that you know some things
at least we have not
talked to you about uh because we want
to wait until we've got them
until we know that they you know are
ready to deploy and ready to move
forward and that they're actually
we can do that um so you know a lot's
coming and we're going to keep pushing
governor uh next question is from
danielle i'm algeria at
fox 45 in dayton governor dewine we've
seen over 74
000 ohioans recover from the virus are
you remaining positive and do you feel
like your face
will help you better keep ohioans safe
i lost the audio sorry
hi governor dewine can you hear me i can
hear you now if you can start again
yes thank you so much thank you so much
um we know that 74 over 74 000 ohioans
have recovered from the virus
are you hopeful and do you feel this
will give you a better understanding of
how to keep ohio and safe
well my experience in life is that uh
you learn from every experience
and uh so uh you know i'm sure this will
be an experience
um not not one i was looking forward to
not one i wanted but
uh you you always learn and i certainly
will look at it
uh from not just from the eyes of a
patient but
look at it from the eyes of the governor
uh and
a better understanding of what other
people go through governor your next
question is from molly co-week at whio
in dayton
hi governor um how do you plan to
effectively lead
while you're in quarantine
well i'm been leading ohio from
the place you're looking at this house
uh since march
i go to columbus uh any day for the
press conference so for
you know for weeks that was every day uh
now we're
using usually doing two a week so i go
to columbus for the press conferences
i go to public safety uh go there for
that
um but most of the work i've done is
right here
uh i mean you know i walk on our farm
many times people don't
don't know i'm walking on the farm but
i'm out walking on the farm and uh
you know talking on the phone you know i
talked yesterday to a number of school
superintendents
um we did it right here did a couple
hour walk
on our farm so um you know
this is this is the modern world and we
can certainly certainly do that it's not
not what we want we'd like to pull
everybody together in a in a room
physically but that's just not possible
today
so you know we do this and so
as long as i'm feeling okay uh we're
obviously we'll be okay in doing this
i've got a great team around me i've got
a great lieutenant governor
um you know i've got a team that is uh
for many of them been with me uh some
for decades uh so it's a team i have a
great deal of trust in
a team that i know the people of the
state of ohio can have trust in
thank you governor we have time for one
last question
uh next up is laura bischoff at the
dayton daily news
hi laura hey governor thanks for doing
this and um
thanks for doing these socially
distanced pressers over the past several
weeks
yeah i guess you you're happy about that
now right
exactly um can you tell us uh if you
have any underlying conditions
other than being over age 50 that could
uh put you at risk for complications
yeah i've had asthma
probably since i was a teenager
it's under control but i take
i take an inhaler regularly in the
morning at night
but it's you know it's it's under
control but it's it is there
sure uh really no other uh
outstanding uh
nothing really i feel good um
you know i think anybody's watch me
whether they agree with me or not or
or not at least say i have plenty of
energy so
i mean i literally start the day about
six o'clock in the morning
i'm working and you know we kick off
about eight o'clock at night usually
seven or eight so that's it
well eric is giving me the sign uh i
guess that is it thank you all
for joining us this is kind of unusual
as i said we're
on our front front porch here and uh
i know some people at least in the in
across ohio have
been here before because we do our
annual ice cream social here so
some sometimes in the summer we didn't
have it this year but the summer
sometimes we have up to 2 000 people
here so
many of you have had a chance at least
to visit this uh our home before
uh so look we'll be we'll be back my
intention is to do uh be part of the
press conference somehow tomorrow
and look forward to talking to you all
then thank you very much
