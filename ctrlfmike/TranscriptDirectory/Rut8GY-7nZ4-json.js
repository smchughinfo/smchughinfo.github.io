    "christian university",
    "in circleville they're founded in 1948",
    "as circleville bible college for the",
    "purpose of educating",
    "clergy for the churches of christ in",
    "christian union",
    "campus continues to grow and the",
    "university continues to grow",
    "while remaining true to its founders",
    "vision ohio christian university has",
    "expanded its outreach by becoming",
    "credited by the higher learning",
    "commission by being affiliated with the",
    "association for biblical higher",
    "education",
    "and the council for christian colleges",
    "and universities",
    "eric let's go to the slides",
    "so you'll see we're running about",
    "average here",
    "as far as cases we normally see a",
    "downturn you see during the weekend and",
    "the day",
    "after the weekend so this is not too far",
    "off kind of where it's been for 21 days",
    "the deaths are are higher",
    "and as i said last time just make sure",
    "everybody understands how this is",
    "done and how it's been done uh",
    "throughout this",
    "um sadly there were an additional 87",
    "deaths reported",
    "during the last 24 hours this is the",
    "highest number of deaths",
    "reported in a day since early may",
    "as the third highest number since the",
    "beginning of the pandemic but",
    "to be clear not all these deaths",
    "occurred in the past day",
    "this is the number reported since the",
    "data was",
    "updated yesterday so it basically was",
    "reported in a 24 hour period",
    "key word is reported corners have",
    "up to six months usually does not take",
    "that long but they have up to six months",
    "to certify a death certificate",
    "so there can be a delay between the date",
    "a death occurs and the date the death is",
    "reported and many times that there",
    "is um let's look at this chart",
    "eric next one uh deaths reported",
    "in last 24 hours by date of",
    "death uh so you'll see back here",
    "there's one case that occurred may 6",
    "that was reported today",
    "one in here somewhere in the latter part",
    "looks like the latter part of june",
    "uh july 25th but once you then get to",
    "august 4th",
    "basically all the deaths that are being",
    "reported today occurred",
    "during this basically a little over a",
    "month period of time",
    "anyway we just we just i get questions",
    "about this and get emails and people",
    "uh you know wonder kind of how this is",
    "done",
    "so we want to make sure that we explain",
    "that correctly",
    "so 83 percent of the deaths reported in",
    "the past 24",
    "hours happened in basically the last",
    "month",
    "let's go to the update in regard to our",
    "88 counties again this",
    "is looking back for a",
    "two-week period of time per 100",
    "000 population and looking at the",
    "counties 1 through 88",
    "as far as who had the most cases",
    "based on population during that period",
    "of time",
    "so eric let's now go to the and this is",
    "available up on our web page",
    "let's go to the top ten",
    "i'll just read them down uh putnam",
    "mercer butler shelby henry",
    "athens franklin montgomery dark and",
    "miami",
    "and again what you'll see here is most",
    "of these are now",
    "some of our more smaller smaller",
    "counties",
    "with several exceptions in here but most",
    "of them are smaller",
    "i wanted to talk about this last week",
    "but we ran out of time",
    "and it is something that is is important",
    "uh ohio veterans hall of fame",
    "it's a real honor to recognize the",
    "achievements of so many remarkable",
    "people",
    "in our great state and certainly among",
    "them ohio veterans",
    "in 1992 my friend george vonovich when",
    "he was governor created the ohio",
    "veterans hall of fame",
    "he recognized that veterans not only",
    "serve",
    "during their time in service but so many",
    "of them when they come back home",
    "continue to serve and just do amazing",
    "amazing things and so what this",
    "is is a recognition of those things that",
    "they've done since they",
    "come home a total of 895",
    "uh of ohio's veterans have been inducted",
    "now into the hall of fame",
    "today i'm pleased to announce that a new",
    "class of veterans",
    "will be joining this distinguished group",
    "of heroes and you'll see their names",
    "here",
    "on on this slide uh the class of 2020",
    "listed on the screen includes 20 men and",
    "women",
    "representing four branches of the armed",
    "service and representing 16 of our ohio",
    "counties",
    "outside of their military service each",
    "has continued to serve our country as",
    "well as this great state",
    "of ohio the veterans have served as",
    "business owners",
    "community volunteers scientists",
    "advocates",
    "engineers and many many more",
    "although the pandemic will prevent us",
    "from gathering in person to celebrate",
    "this year",
    "uh we're very grateful for each one",
    "of our veterans and each one of the",
    "veterans who we're honoring today",
    "and our ohio department veterans",
    "services will be presenting",
    "each one of the recipients uh with your",
    "medals",
    "we'll also post a virtual ceremony",
    "online on november 5th",
    "at ohiovets.gov",
    "so again congratulations to our ohio",
    "veterans hall of fame",
    "class of 2020. thank you so very very",
    "much",
    "for your service speaking of veterans",
    "i want to wish uh ohioan asa newman",
    "who is a tuskegee airman in world war",
    "ii a very happy 102nd",
    "birthday coming up mr newman grew up in",
    "cleveland",
    "now lives in ravenna so happy birthday",
    "and thank you so very very much for your",
    "service",
    "so we talked last time about having uh",
    "director mcelroy",
    "uh here uh to talk really about",
    "what's going on as far as testing uh you",
    "know",
    "in our nursing homes and some of our",
    "other uh facilities",
    "uh i think the director is on and uh",
    "director can you",
    "can you hear me i can hear you governor",
    "director director is the director of",
    "aging uh thank you very much for",
    "joining us she's joined us i know before",
    "but",
    "um director talk to us a little bit",
    "about and we'll start maybe with our",
    "nursing homes",
    "and about the testing that is is going",
    "on now",
    "in our nursing homes this has been",
    "something that we started",
    "with the ohio national guard very early",
    "on",
    "uh it has evolved what the testing in",
    "the nursing homes",
    "remains very very important so let's",
    "start if we could with with our nursing",
    "homes if you could tell us what's going",
    "on in our nursing homes",
    "absolutely so thank you sir and as you",
    "know every action that we're taking",
    "is so important in preventing the spread",
    "and reducing the number of deaths",
    "we know that for preventing the spread",
    "across the country in the world",
    "testing is one of the most critical",
    "tools in our arsenal",
    "and so when ohio's long-term care",
    "facilities perform covet 19",
    "testing on their staffs they're",
    "screening in a preventive way",
    "to catch early those who are positive so",
    "that the spread is stopped",
    "we know that the risk is real and the",
    "result for older loved ones can be",
    "devastating",
    "and so we continue to build our",
    "capabilities to have rapid and",
    "widespread testing available",
    "so in summary in our nursing homes we",
    "test for three reasons",
    "one if someone is symptomatic if a",
    "person exhibits signs or symptoms of",
    "covet 19 they must be tested",
    "and in the case of a staff person they",
    "are expected to be restricted from the",
    "facility pending results of those tests",
    "two if someone tests positive in a",
    "nursing home",
    "all resident and staff are tested",
    "this is because it's important to have",
    "rapid identification and isolation of",
    "new cases",
    "to stop further viral transmission",
    "then three we have what's known as",
    "routine staff testing based on the",
    "extent of the virus in the community",
    "and so i think it's also important to",
    "note that",
    "the facilities are subject to specific",
    "reporting requirements and they must",
    "demonstrate compliance with",
    "these testing requirements if there is",
    "non-compliance enforcement remedies can",
    "be imposed",
    "and in many of these cases we are",
    "offering some assistance some state",
    "supported assistance",
    "for example the guard still assists by",
    "picking up specimens and delivering them",
    "to the lab",
    "so that so our the involvement today",
    "with the guard",
    "started off the guard was doing the",
    "swabbing if i",
    "remember correctly but what the guard is",
    "doing now",
    "uh in in a number of cases is picking up",
    "basically from the nursing home and",
    "taking to to the lab",
    "correct correct one of our strategies",
    "was to build",
    "self-sufficiency so that the strategy",
    "could",
    "be sustainable and so in many cases the",
    "facilities have the capability to do",
    "their own specimen collection",
    "and we assist with helping with in some",
    "cases the packaging and definitely the",
    "transport",
    "to the lab and the testing itself is",
    "supplied how",
    "the test the the the kits or",
    "whatever is used yes so again with the",
    "state support we provide the kids",
    "and and that's those are the kits that",
    "we assist with when we go to pick up",
    "and deliver to the labs okay so the labs",
    "that",
    "these labs for the nursing homes then",
    "would be",
    "in the state of ohio basically is that",
    "right right",
    "we primarily um we do use other labs but",
    "we can have lab capacity",
    "uh we're going to use that capacity so",
    "okay",
    "let's let's go to assisted living and",
    "kind of tell us with the",
    "assisted living and then maybe to give",
    "an idea for",
    "everyone who's watching let me go back",
    "to the nursing homes",
    "uh we have approximately how many",
    "residents in nursing homes",
    "in in ohio uh so when you begin to talk",
    "about nursing homes between staff and",
    "nursing",
    "between staff and residents you're",
    "looking at about upward of 160",
    "000 people that have to be tested um so",
    "it's a pretty good split between staff",
    "and residents but you've got a",
    "lot of people that have to be tested",
    "okay let's move to",
    "to the assisted living and",
    "those numbers would be what about the",
    "same as",
    "as in nursing homes or um somewhat",
    "different um assisted living facilities",
    "we have about 770 of those",
    "throughout the state you're looking at",
    "about 80 000 or so people that have to",
    "be tested",
    "so it's a little different assisted",
    "living facilities have a different",
    "structure oftentimes they're configured",
    "different than a nursing facility but",
    "still have people who have high care",
    "needs within them",
    "and in the in the assisted living what",
    "what is how's the testing",
    "done now and how often is it done what's",
    "the protocol",
    "today so right now they are on",
    "every other week testing cadence",
    "i think it's important to note that",
    "here in late august we we certainly",
    "were providing state support assistance",
    "we were notified by the assisted living",
    "facilities a small number of some",
    "testing data inconsistencies and",
    "and so we did quickly pause so we can",
    "address the source of that problem",
    "we now know that we have identified the",
    "source",
    "and we are excited to resume our state",
    "supported testing",
    "so that will be starting this week i",
    "think correct we're ready to go this",
    "week",
    "absolutely and again",
    "in regard to just make sure",
    "i'm correct uh assisted living that",
    "testing",
    "that national protocol is for staff",
    "every",
    "every two weeks all right this is what",
    "we've at",
    "here within our state we have customer",
    "assistant living facilities to test",
    "every other week minimally",
    "so to the extent that the facility",
    "perhaps",
    "has the capability to test more we",
    "certainly want to encourage that but at",
    "a minimum every other week",
    "is the expectation okay",
    "um let's go to adult day care i know",
    "we've had questions about that",
    "adult daycare i believe is going to",
    "start back up they can start back up on",
    "the 21st",
    "yeah you want to give us a little",
    "overview of what's going on as far as",
    "what will be going on as far as testing",
    "there absolutely so we're excited adult",
    "day centers are permitted to reopen on",
    "the 21st",
    "on their very valued sector of our",
    "long-term care",
    "continuum they often provide a lesser",
    "restrictive alternative",
    "to some of their facility care",
    "but throughout the pandemic their",
    "congregate services did remain closed",
    "for a great period of time their testing",
    "will include testing for",
    "staff and participants minimally every",
    "other week",
    "and this is really important due to the",
    "the the fluid nature of adult day",
    "the participants come and go each day",
    "the staff have to come and go each day",
    "so",
    "we'll stick really closely with",
    "ourselves",
    "partnering with our adult day partners",
    "so that we can provide the support they",
    "need in this testing environment",
    "okay and what about our senior centers",
    "they're",
    "allowed to open again on the 21st and",
    "how",
    "how are you going to how are we handling",
    "that absolutely and it's a wonderful day",
    "for a lot of communities as a place for",
    "recreation preventative care the",
    "benefits of bounds with our senior",
    "centers and",
    "again as you mentioned they too have",
    "been closed for congregate services",
    "since march",
    "and so we're ready to get them going",
    "testing for them will be for all staff",
    "again every other week participants will",
    "be",
    "on what we call a strategic testing sort",
    "of model and that is if an individual",
    "presents with symptoms",
    "at that point we would ask that they are",
    "required that they then",
    "insist upon testing but otherwise",
    "it is a cadence primarily for their",
    "staff",
    "and and with these adult daycare senior",
    "centers",
    "obviously if someone has a temperature",
    "or someone has symptoms then that person",
    "will be",
    "you know the normal protocols we would",
    "expect would be followed",
    "absolutely i think it's worth noting",
    "thank you for pointing that out governor",
    "um this was adult day",
    "senior centers nursing facilities",
    "and assisted living facilities all of",
    "these are very important groups",
    "in addition to the testing they also",
    "appreciate the need for infection",
    "prevention and control",
    "so that is the cleaning that is the",
    "screening that is the maintaining logs",
    "there is a significant amount of work",
    "that goes into preparing",
    "these particular sites for people to",
    "come in safely",
    "so all of those things must happen not",
    "only",
    "when they are able to reopen and start",
    "but throughout",
    "great director let me just close",
    "by asking you about visitation in",
    "nursing homes i get texts a lot i get",
    "calls about visitation uh we opened up",
    "uh",
    "nursing homes to visitation uh a few",
    "months ago what",
    "july 20th they were able to begin",
    "outdoor visitation",
    "uh it was early june june 8th for the",
    "assisted living facilities that is",
    "correct the outdoor visitation is",
    "is in play we certainly know that the",
    "weather",
    "uh is not on our side but we recognize",
    "how important it is to have",
    "ongoing connections and",
    "having those relationships remain so it",
    "is not our plan to do anything to",
    "disrupt those connections in fact we're",
    "working really hard",
    "to be able to bolster those connections",
    "here really soon and so",
    "i look forward uh to coming to you and",
    "you being able to announce here very",
    "soon uh what we have in store",
    "for indoor visitation and if i might add",
    "one last thing sir",
    "in addition to that because we have",
    "heard so much from families",
    "we've also worked in ways to enhance our",
    "transparency around visitation",
    "and so we are working really hard to",
    "here soon stand up",
    "a dashboard if you will something public",
    "facing where",
    "our families our loved ones can see",
    "what visitation looks like in their",
    "respective communities what type of",
    "visitation",
    "when you can visit and and if it has",
    "fluctuated based upon",
    "the case spread in that community or",
    "that facility",
    "so i know uh you you and i get calls",
    "and you get a lot more than i do but",
    "about people who say look i can't visit",
    "my loved one in a nursing home",
    "what's usually going on there it could",
    "be a variety of things",
    "sometimes visitation has to pause",
    "because",
    "maybe there has been a spread",
    "of cobot 19 within that particular",
    "facility",
    "it could be a situation where there is",
    "significant community spread where the",
    "facility sits",
    "they're just a host of reasons and then",
    "one thing i would encourage",
    "people if you have a question if you",
    "have concerns if you have not been able",
    "to have those meaningful connections",
    "we always want you to reach out to our",
    "office at the ohio department of aging",
    "in particular our state long-term care",
    "ombudsman",
    "so that we can look into the matter",
    "we serve as an advocate and we certainly",
    "want to do anything we can",
    "to safely restore those connections good",
    "director thank you very much we",
    "appreciate it thanks for all",
    "the good work that you do thank you sir",
    "appreciate it",
    "eric um i forgot to couple the slides uh",
    "if we could go to",
    "three three slides we'll start see which",
    "one comes up first",
    "uh i asked our team uh a week or so ago",
    "to kind of do",
    "an analysis of where we are",
    "and with every state surrounding us so",
    "i just might be of interest this first",
    "slide is cases per hundred thousand",
    "based on population by the state so um",
    "as you can see pennsylvania's at 5.8",
    "we're at 8.3 and then we",
    "move up from there so ohio is",

    "today is kind of a landmark for us",
    "within the next half hour",
    "we will have completed four weeks of",
    "school in person",
    "so we're really excited about the fact",
    "that uh our students were able to get",
    "back into the buildings",
    "reconnect with their teachers reconnect",
    "with their peers",
    "and it's been a very positive experience",
    "for us so tell us a little bit about",
    "what you've done and",
    "what you're noticing how's it just kind",
    "of how's it going",
    "well i would just start with the fact",
    "that um you know we",
    "we bought into information from the",
    "american academy of pediatrics that",
    "the best place for students to be if",
    "possible was in school in person",
    "and uh each community had to make their",
    "own decision",
    "uh based on what was best for their",
    "community but when we polled our parents",
    "back in june",
    "90 of those parents said we want our",
    "kids back in school and so",
    "we were able to bring them back into the",
    "district",
    "we started on august the 19th uh we like",
    "to say that we're able to see them smile",
    "even with their mask on we see the smile",
    "in their eyes",
    "and we've been really excited about",
    "having them on campus",
    "not just the fact that academically we",
    "believe it's a",
    "it's a plus but also social emotional",
    "health and nutrition they're just a lot",
    "of different ways that",
    "we believe it's a positive that they're",
    "in the buildings",
    "i would just share a couple of quick",
    "stories with you maybe today governor",
    "that",
    "um one of the things that we did before",
    "the school year started was that",
    "we reached out to a local non-profit",
    "organization who rented",
    "picnic tables to festivals like",
    "oktoberfest and obviously",
    "they didn't have the ability to do that",
    "this year because the festivals had been",
    "canceled",
    "so we rented about 60 picnic tables and",
    "brought them in",
    "and we've had the ability to split our",
    "lunches and so every other day",
    "our students eat outside at the picnic",
    "table and",
    "that's been a really big plus for us",
    "it not only has freed up room in a",
    "cafeteria for those students still",
    "eating in the cafeteria to",
    "social distance and be able to get apart",
    "from each other but",
    "every other day the students come we've",
    "got a beautiful fall here in the miami",
    "valley and so",
    "every other day the students come",
    "knowing that they're going to get to eat",
    "outside at the picnic tables",
    "obviously that's a time when they've got",
    "to take their mask off in order to eat",
    "and uh i've learned through actually",
    "through your press conferences governor",
    "that",
    "we're 19 times less likely to catch cove",
    "but when we're outside",
    "and so we feel like that's been a real",
    "positive our kids are enjoying the fresh",
    "air",
    "they're enjoying the opportunity to get",
    "outside and that's one thing that we",
    "could do",
    "as a school district to help prevent",
    "covid but still have students on campus",
    "every day",
    "well that's very innovative and i",
    "imagine the students like that",
    "that's kind of fun to get out get",
    "outside particularly if it's a day",
    "a day in the fall like this a little a",
    "little cooler today but",

    "students from a community are able to",
    "come to school every day and make eye",
    "contact and",
    "and reach out to teachers and teachers",
    "can can develop that rapport bus drivers",
    "we talk about the fact that they're the",
    "first to see our students every day when",
    "they pick them up",
    "on the way to school cafeteria workers",
    "paraprofessionals",
    "uh across the board i just think again",
    "we're one month then now we're excited",
    "about that",
    "we see a lot of positive attitudes",
    "we developed a little refrigerator",
    "magnet that we passed out to every",
    "student to begin a year with the",
    "covid19 checklist of what you need to",
    "make sure you bring to school each day",
    "and at the bottom of that was a positive",

    "superintendents if you can do something",
    "outside you can be outside",
    "uh generally it's gonna be safer than",
    "than being inside",
    "so we think we're ready for for",
    "questions",
    "governor first question today is from",
    "laura hancock cleveland.com",
    "hello governor um hi",
    "um on sunday our reporters saw a lot of",
    "football fans",
    "at bars in the cleveland area not",
    "observing",
    "social distancing and other rules to",
    "prevent the spread of covid",
    "we haven't seen a lot of citations as a",
    "result of that",
    "on this thursday night the browns play",
    "their first game at home",
    "how concerned are you about this will",
    "there be any renewed effort for agents",
    "to monitor bars on thursday night",
    "well it's football season and there",
    "certainly is ample opportunity for",
    "people to get together and watch",
    "football",
    "brown's bengals game is always always a",
    "fun game two great quarterbacks this",
    "year and",
    "great other players so you know it's",
    "going to be a fun uh",
    "fun opportunity for everybody but we",
    "just look we just tell people to be",
    "careful",
    "um you know i know that football brings",
    "a lot of people out who want to kind of",
    "congregate together and we understand",
    "that but um you know the biggest spread",
    "we see",
    "uh is when people are congregating",
    "together uh",
    "and you know as far as our borrowers are",
    "concerns the vast majority of our",
    "borrowers",
    "people own them people run them are",
    "doing a good job same with restaurants",
    "um you know we do have agents out from",
    "liquor control",
    "um you know we saw the first first bar",
    "uh that was lost their license i think",
    "it was yesterday",
    "it's not what we want to see but again",
    "the agents will do",
    "will do their job when they when they go",
    "out and",
    "you know many times people in the bar",
    "make it very difficult",
    "for people who are running the bar and",
    "uh so",
    "you know bar owners ultimately are",
    "responsible but we would just",
    "ask everyone help them out help your",
    "your favorite bar",
    "out don't create a problem don't have",
    "such congregation that",
    "uh you know there's there's a great",
    "possibility or spread so yeah we look we",
    "we we're concerned anytime that you have",
    "people who are",
    "coming together in in close proximity",
    "together and a lot of people",
    "but the you know the rules of the bar",
    "rules of restaurants are people have to",
    "be six feet",
    "they cannot congregate together they",
    "need to be seated",
    "these are all the basic things that have",
    "been in the rules for for some time i",
    "think if people do that they can have a",
    "good time",
    "they can root for the bengals for the",
    "browns and you know have a",
    "have a good evening we also of course as",
    "you know",
    "that game is the first game uh there",
    "will be six thousand uh",
    "fans uh admitted they'll be in quadrants",
    "uh in different",
    "areas uh and again you know",
    "based on their plan uh you know and",
    "based upon our confidence in them we're",
    "sure that the browns will do a very good",
    "job",
    "we're sure that the bengals when they",
    "host a home game their second game will",
    "do a good job as well next question is",
    "from kevin landers at wbns",
    "in columbus hello governor hi kevin",
    "uh governor dr duvey seems surprised to",
    "learn about the treatment dr",
    "acton received and mentioned that as",
    "reasons not to accept the position",
    "did you withhold that information from",
    "her did you believe her as that's the",
    "reason",
    "that she decided not to accept the",
    "position and also just to kind of switch",
    "tears a little bit",
    "uh halloween uh is coming up uh you're",
    "going to leave that to communities to",
    "decide or is that going to be",
    "something will step in and decide",
    "whether or not that's safe enough to",
    "happen",
    "look local health departments as well as",
    "the state health department will have",
    "certainly have recommendations in regard",
    "to halloween",
    "i don't have those today you know look",
    "as far as dr",
    "duvey is concerned i take people at face",
    "value",
    "i've had people before tell me for",
    "personal reasons they couldn't do",
    "something",
    "they couldn't take a job and or they",
    "need to leave a job",
    "when someone tells you it's personal",
    "reasons you know",
    "i move on because you have to respect",
    "what that person is saying",
    "um we had conversations i had",
    "conversations lieutenant governor had",
    "conversations and i know",
    "um you know key members of my team uh",
    "had",
    "conversations with with her uh and i do",
    "know that",
    "some of the conversation came up in",
    "regard to uh the demonstration for",
    "example",
    "uh that took place at dr atkins home",
    "so um look i mean sometimes",
    "things don't you don't fully grasp",
    "things",
    "this happens to me until you kind of get",
    "into something",
    "and then you see it more um",
    "but i'm only only speculating um you",
    "know we were",
    "we were open uh with her",
    "um but you know she called that night um",
    "you all remember a press conference at 2",
    "30 or something i announced it and",
    "you know 7 30 or so i was getting a call",
    "from",
    "from my team and said that you know she",
    "had she had called",
    "and for personal reasons felt that she",
    "needed to withdraw so i respect",
    "that",
    "next question is from jeff redick at",
    "wsyx in columbus",
    "thank you the follow-up on that governor",
    "do you worry that",
    "not only because she withdrew but",
    "because dr duvey specifically called out",
    "the treatment of a prior health director",
    "in ohio that that would in any way",
    "deter future candidates from this job",
    "well",
    "i think if the question is can we find a",
    "a person to serve who's a very good",
    "person to serve as health director",
    "uh the answer certainly is is yes we",
    "also",
    "as you know have a vacancy and medical",
    "director and so we're looking to fill",
    "that position as well the previous",
    "medical director",
    "after being with the department many",
    "years retired so these are two key",
    "positions",
    "certainly that we're trying to fill",
    "we'll be able to fill them",
    "next question is from andy chow at ohio",
    "public radio and television",
    "andy hi governor is is dr dube the first",
    "to turn down the position or have you",
    "offered this to other people who have",
    "also turned it down",
    "have you heard these concerns about",
    "potential public harassment from other",
    "candidates i would have to check",
    "with laurel with ann but",
    "i don't recall having",
    "anyone else express to me uh that they",
    "had a concern",
    "about not serving because of that reason",
    "we have certainly when you reach out to",
    "a number of people um you know once in a",
    "while someone's going to say no i'm not",
    "interested in the job",
    "but i'm not aware of anybody",
    "saying that the reason they would not be",
    "interested in the job would be",
    "because of what happened in regard to dr",
    "acton",
    "so i'm not i'm not aware of that at all",
    "i don't think that's happened",
    "next question is from jack windsor at",
    "wmfd in mansfield",
    "hey jack hi governor uh yesterday a",
    "federal judge in pennsylvania",
    "issued a declaratory judgment that",
    "struck down governor wolf's",
    "business closures gathering limits and",
    "his stay-at-home orders in that state",
    "and the judge said quote even in an",
    "emergency the authority of the",
    "government",
    "is not unfettered the liberties",
    "protected by the constitution",
    "are not fair weather freedoms in place",
    "when times are good but able to be cast",
    "aside",
    "in times of trouble now the judge's",
    "decision was based upon federal",
    "constitutional",
    "consideration so although at this point",
    "the decision is",
    "persuasive it's not binding on ohio",
    "it may end up having implications here",
    "perhaps so governor a simple but",
    "important question today",
    "you've said in the past wearing masks",
    "abiding by",
    "business restrictions and honoring",
    "limits on social gatherings",
    "is the way for ohioans to buy or earn",
    "their freedom",
    "do you believe that in the united states",
    "freedom is something that citizens must",
    "earn",
    "or do you agree with the federal judge",
    "the constitutional freedoms are granted",
    "unconditionally to everyone at all times",
    "not just when it's conducted",
    "well we have a wonderful constitution we",
    "are blessed with the constitution that",
    "we have we're",
    "blessed with the liberty that we have um",
    "you know i i would i would go back to",
    "what some of our founders said",
    "uh you know these these these basic",
    "rights do not come from government these",
    "basic rights come from god",
    "so i don't think you and i jack will",
    "quarrel on that",
    "uh what happened in pennsylvania i don't",
    "know i don't think about the case i",
    "don't know what their statute says",
    "uh so i don't want you know i'm not",
    "going to comment on on that",
    "but you know liberties that we have the",
    "the rights that we have",
    "uh protected by our constitution um",
    "i do not think it's unfettered i don't",
    "don't think there's unlimited",
    "i'm the or that my power or any elected",
    "official's power",
    "is is uh unlimited at all",
    "so there's probably more you and i agree",
    "on them",
    "than you might think next question",
    "is from jackie borchardt at cincinnati",
    "inquirer",
    "thank you governor um two two questions",
    "here one will you be in zanesville with",
    "the vice president tomorrow",
    "and second what happened to the state's",
    "efforts to bring antigen tests",
    "uh and use them broadly here",
    "yeah we're look we had conversations uh",
    "yesterday four or five o'clock",
    "uh with some of our lab people our lab",
    "experts our testing experts uh",
    "about antigen uh we think antigen is",
    "a part of an overall strategy",
    "uh and we will get be we will have that",
    "be coming in",
    "part of this is is how far along the",
    "private sector",
    "uh is in regard to development but we",
    "i got a pretty good briefing on it or an",
    "update on it and uh",
    "you know we're we're all in in the sense",
    "that that",
    "pcr tests are important the antigen",
    "tests are important they play a",
    "different role",
    "and they're both very very very",
    "important",
    "i'm not planning on being in in",
    "zanesville tomorrow i'm always happy to",
    "see the vice president come to ohio",
    "and uh you know we welcome welcome him",
    "to come",
    "next question is from max philby at the",
    "columbus dispatch",
    "hey governor um we're approaching this",
    "week",
    "the deadline that your administration",
    "had set for schools to report um",
    "coveted case data uh should we expect to",

    "and so you're going to you're going to",
    "see those",
    "look the schools are doing i think a",
    "very good job",
    "at least from what i can see um in",
    "reporting that i think the local news",
    "media is reporting uh we happen to live",
    "in the dayton media market but i",
    "i look at media from around the state",
    "and uh",
    "i think the media is reporting uh what a",
    "lot of schools are in fact doing schools",
    "are being being very open about many of",
    "them have dashboards up",
    "so we're going to do what we said we're",
    "going to do and we're going to try to do",
    "it in",
    "the time we said we would do it",
    "next question is from jim adi at w-h-i-o",
    "in dayton governor governor if we can",
    "let's go back to the protests and the",
    "harassment that",
    "dr acton faced and dr duvey chose not to",
    "face",
    "to what degree is this making your job",
    "harder to",
    "find that next person and would you",
    "warn the candidates those potential new",
    "hires",
    "this is the kind of protests and",
    "harassment that",
    "potentially you would face when you come",
    "here to take this job",
    "well i don't think ohio is unique um you",
    "know",
    "jim we've seen protests against",
    "governors we've seen protests against",
    "health directors throughout this country",
    "uh we know that these are issues that",
    "are",
    "can be divisive uh i've tried to do",
    "everything i can so that we're",
    "not divided uh as a state because i",
    "think",
    "that we need to be together uh and and",
    "fight this battle uh together but look",
    "we live in a country when people can",
    "express their opinions they can do that",
    "we are firm believers in the first",
    "amendment they can go",
    "demonstrate they can protest so i don't",
    "think we're in a different position than",
    "any other state that would be hiring a",
    "health director",
    "you know what you're looking looking for",
    "is you know",
    "somebody who has um you know the",
    "qualifications to",
    "to do to do the job",
    "you know when you look at a health",
    "department there's a lot of things",
    "that you need you need you need the",
    "management side of it which is very very",
    "important",
    "which is has a lot of similarities to",
    "management of any organization",
    "and it's a very important organization",
    "uh it's part of it's the recruitment of",
    "of good personnel that's a component",
    "part",
    "um you also have to have people in here",
    "um",
    "you know who can give give the governor",
    "and give the rest of our team um medical",
    "medical advice uh certainly dr",
    "dr acton uh you know did that",
    "but uh you know we're looking for a",
    "medical director as well",
    "and we're looking for a health director",
    "and those two",
    "those two positions kind of cover all",
    "the things that i just",
    "just kind of laid out so we'll we'll",
    "find the right people and let me just",
    "say i don't want to",
    "get too concerned we have some very very",
    "good people",
    "at the health department right now some",
    "of them been there a long time",
    "we have during this pandemic",
    "surged in people from other",
    "departments and we will continue to do",
    "that",
    "people who are good managers uh people",
    "who",
    "can be of assistance and we've really",
    "reached out",
    "uh outside uh state government and",
    "uh uh you know with our colleges and our",
    "universities",

    "yeah they're there",
    "so you know we've pulled a lot of people",
    "together",
    "and i think that's what the public would",
    "expect we are in a battle we're in a war",
    "uh and it's not over i know we're",
    "getting tired",
    "but uh you know we have to continue to",

    "state",
    "some in government some out of",
    "government and they're making a huge",
    "huge difference",
    "so uh it's it's a very strong team we've",
    "got a couple positions to fill",
    "but as the team is on the field today",
    "it's a very",
    "good team as i said but it's aided by a",

    "who live here or people who are thinking",
    "about moving here or even bringing a",
    "business here that",
    "we have multiple people who cite abuse",
    "from the public as a reason they don't",
    "want to work in public office",
    "do you think this reflects poorly on",
    "ohio",
    "no look i mean look we're a state uh",
    "of individuals um individuals who",
    "were midwesterners where ohioans were",

    "and we're resilient and with that those",

    "it includes my team uh but they're all",
    "giving of themselves to something bigger",
    "than their old lives or their own selves",
    "so i am i'm excited about what we're",
    "doing",
    "um it's not me it's all the people we've",
    "got and it's all ohioans who are in this",
    "battle",
    "and so we're in the middle of this",
    "battle it is not over with i don't know",
    "what percentage of it is gone",
    "uh but you know we have we're fighting",
    "with the tools that we have",
    "uh until we get a vaccine uh and we",
    "really get",
    "into that with a large number of people",
    "uh taking it",
    "we're going to continue this battle with",
    "the tools that we have and we're going",
    "to fight with the tools we have what are",
    "they",
    "the ability to wear a mask the ability",
    "to social distance",
    "uh the ability to to to follow good",
    "good hygiene making decisions like being",
    "outside",
    "if it's a choice of inside or outside",
    "doing something going going outside",
    "so these are all things that ohioans",
    "have done well",
    "i put the numbers up on there uh",
    "compared us to other states and they're",
    "all doing working hard",
    "um and we're not trying to compare but",
    "we're doing okay",
    "uh we're we're doing okay but we have to",
    "keep going",
    "uh we've got we've got a ways to go we",
    "can't let this slip away from us",
    "if we want our kids to be in school then",
    "we've got to continue to fight",
    "and so uh it's a it's a cause that i",
    "think is a",
    "is a very very important cause um we'll",
    "fill these these two slots and uh",
    "but in the meantime we're battling on",
    "next question is from noah blundo at",
    "hannah news service",
    "uh good after governor good afternoon",
    "governor can you hear me",
    "i can indeed yes thank you um",
    "today the department of education",
    "released uh school report cards that",
    "don't have any grades on them and",
    "missing a lot of testing data because of",
    "how things had to go in the spring",
    "because of the pandemic the legislature",
    "is considering whether school should be",
    "graded for this year whether",
    "you know and people have suggested",
    "students children shouldn't be tested",
    "how do",
    "what do you feel about how",
    "students should be assessed this year",
    "and how their districts",
    "should be graded this year based on",
    "how things are going so far well first",
    "of all i fully recognize that this is",
    "something that the legislature",
    "decides i certainly can have an opinion",
    "about it",
    "you know i've talked a little bit to the",
    "speaker and the senate president",
    "i have a great deal of respect for both",
    "of them and and the minority",
    "leaders uh is as well so this is",
    "something that we will be talking about",
    "um what i have said is that i think",
    "there has to be",
    "enough tests uh so requisite tests",
    "so that parents and schools kind of know",
    "where they are",
    "because this has been difficult i mean",
    "we had a",
    "we had a spring that was an unusual",
    "spring",
    "uh we're having an unusual fall we've",
    "got some kids that are doing it",
    "on remote so we need to be able to",
    "measure that uh but i guess from",
    "from my personal point of view the",
    "consequences that go with that i'm not",
    "so too excited about that uh i want to",
    "know",
    "i think people need to know where their",
    "kids are uh but as far as",
    "you know writing schools or ranking",
    "schools and doing things like that and",
    "other ramifications i'm not sure that",
    "that's really",
    "that important now i will point out the",
    "obvious and that is that",
    "the federal law restricts us",
    "in this area and unless there's some",
    "you know changes you know the federal",
    "law is going to dictate",
    "some of these tests that we don't have",
    "any choice about",
    "next question is from scott hallas at",
    "the xenia daily gazette",
    "hey scott hey how you doing today",
    "i'm well sir good good um the ohio",
    "controlling board",
    "yesterday denied the request from the",
    "secretary of state",
    "uh to be able to pay for uh postage for",
    "absentee ballots",
    "you know in this in this tough economic",
    "time where you know even mailing two or",
    "three ballots",
    "could cause a hardship for people and",
    "where people don't want to get out and",
    "vote",
    "um how important was this request and",
    "what what's your reaction to that",
    "well to state my position uh i've made",
    "this",
    "shared it with the legislative leaders",
    "you know i would",
    "i'm in favor of that but",
    "it was clear that the legislative",
    "leaders and not just the leaders but",
    "this legislature did not want to do that",
    "but let me say",
    "our secretary of state and local boards",
    "i think are doing a good job everybody",
    "in this state should have by now",
    "received the application um",
    "so they have the opportunity to go fill",
    "that application in",
    "uh friend i have them in inside the",
    "house",
    "and send it in and then as soon as the",
    "day comes when those",
    "absentee ballots can be sent out they",
    "can be sent out so",
    "it's it's really i think a pretty easy",
    "process and procedure someone does have",
    "to",
    "fix a stamp to it there's no doubt about",
    "that but i think it's a pretty",
    "easy process i think ohio does a good",
    "job",
    "we have voting for four weeks you can",
    "vote if you want to vote in person you",
    "can go to your",
    "local board of elections and vote when",
    "you get down to the last weekend or so",
    "you can vote on sunday you can vote uh",
    "other times and you can look look that",
    "up if you want to wait till election day",
    "fran i usually wait till election day",
    "you know you've got 13 hours to go vote",
    "6 30 in the morning to 7",
    "30 at night we're used to though",
    "uh having people vote absentee",
    "and we've done it i think for about two",
    "decades or so",
    "and so that's something we're used to",
    "now i would expect at least the",
    "secretary of state tells me that the",
    "numbers requesting that are up",
    "so we would expect those numbers to be",
    "higher but",
    "with or without the state paying for the",
    "stamp",
    "i think that we we're going to run a",
    "very good election and i think people",
    "have",
    "every opportunity out there to vote and",
    "we're a",
    "state that that values that",
    "and i think we'll be fine",
    "next question is from jake zuckerman at",

    "berry's history",
    "of the 1918 flu pandemic a few times at",

    "and on the last page of that book barry",
    "says the following about lessons to",
    "learn from the spanish flu pandemic",
    "uh direct quote here those in authority",
    "must retain the public trust",
    "the way to do that is to distort nothing",
    "to put the best face on nothing",
    "to try to manipulate no one quote",
    "even the president's remarks that he",
    "downplayed the virus early on to avoid a",
    "kind of panic",
    "do you think the president ever learned",
    "that lesson",
    "well i thought you were asking about me",
    "actually what we're doing in ohio",
    "um look i mean i read the book um",

    "when you get a crisis like this um you",
    "know",
    "i i've tried to be as open as i can",

    "so you know when we would have said",
    "early on because this was the guidance",
    "and what everybody thought well",
    "mask was not that important it turned",
    "out that was wrong",

    "know when i knew it",
    "and but we continue to evolve of what",

    "looking into the problem and figuring",
    "out okay well what can we do to help you",
    "and what do you need and that's that's",
    "how the white house has has",
