    "good afternoon everyone today i'm",
    "wearing a tie",
    "from university hospitals in cleveland",
    "we are blessed in ohio to have some",
    "amazing hospitals and so",
    "i wear this to honor all the first-line",
    "workers",
    "doctors nurses everyone who makes all",
    "our hospitals",
    "work every single day for us around the",
    "state of ohio",
    "today i think we should uh pause",
    "and talk a little bit about where we are",
    "uh in this coronavirus and where we're",
    "going",
    "um in a sense you can liken this to",
    "halftime uh mill the game no one knows",
    "exactly if we're",
    "in the middle but uh probably not not",
    "too far away",
    "uh from that i'll talk about that",
    "in in a moment but let's first go to our",
    "uh slides and look and look at the data",
    "for today",
    "today we are reporting 1447",
    "new cases uh to put this in perspective",
    "in the last seven days our cases have",
    "averaged",
    "uh close to that a little bit over that",
    "1475 cases per day",
    "by report date we had been averaging",
    "to put this in perspective a little over",
    "a thousand cases per day",
    "only two weeks ago so we've gone up",
    "quite dramatically in several weeks",
    "let's look at the positivity another way",
    "of looking at this",
    "as we increase",
    "the testing uh we would hope to be",
    "seeing",
    "a drop in positivity we're not seeing",
    "that",
    "this is a chart that only goes back and",
    "i want to make sure everyone understands",
    "this goes back to july 1.",
    "from july 1 basically to the present",
    "you can see what's happened our",
    "positivity is now showing for the last",
    "day 4.1",
    "uh 3.9 for the last seven day",
    "average uh it was 2.7",
    "on september 23rd and 24th",
    "so again these numbers have gone up",
    "dramatically",
    "let's take a look at our top 88",
    "88 counties and what you will see here",
    "again these numbers just continue uh",
    "these numbers",
    "unfortunately just continue to to go up",
    "um athens",
    "and fayette county uh are both",
    "in putnam mercer dark",
    "all those counties are about three times",
    "what the high incidence level",
    "of the cdc so it's off the charts",
    "and then we go on down from there so",
    "again starting athens fayette",
    "putnam mercer dark all glaze jackson",
    "butler henry miami fulton allen ross",
    "shelby then the green clark montgomery",
    "sayo to lawrence",
    "muskingham those are the top top",
    "counties",
    "as we move as we move forward",
    "this map now shows how many counties are",
    "red",
    "and how many are high incense um",
    "so red county as you can see",
    "if it's a high incidence level um",
    "that simply means that they're over 100",
    "cases per",
    "100 000 for every every two weeks",
    "so we're now seeing 51 of our counties",
    "that are high incidence counties and",
    "that's just a real",
    "real problem what this means is we've",
    "seen this spread",
    "and if you look at this if you're in a",
    "high incident county or you're a red",
    "county",
    "you know we certainly should be",
    "concerned",
    "uh we're not trying to scare anybody but",
    "but these measures have never looked",
    "like this since we've done this we've",
    "never had as many high incidence",
    "counties",
    "and we certainly have a lot of red",
    "counties so if you look at for example",
    "the western side of the state two",
    "counties in",
    "every single county uh looks like it's",
    "high incidence",
    "uh or or red county and this really",
    "shows just how this virus has spread",
    "uh out throughout throughout the state",
    "um and again if",
    "if your county's red or high incidence",
    "that's a big",
    "big concern um so let's",
    "let's step back for a moment uh and kind",
    "of look",
    "where we are going as i say maybe it",
    "sort of like being at halftime and i get",
    "questions all the time mike when's this",
    "going to be over",
    "um governor work when i can take off my",
    "mask i'm sick of the mask",
    "when can i do that",
    "what's our goal what's halloween going",
    "to look like what's thanksgiving going",
    "to look like what's",
    "christmas going to look like um",
    "next year baseball uh and on and on",
    "um and these are the things that we all",
    "ask ourselves",
    "now the truth is that no one can answer",
    "these questions with great certainty",
    "what we can say is that things will get",
    "better",
    "but in all likelihood they will get",
    "worse before they get better",
    "and we're already seeing that in the",
    "trend lines of the last",
    "several weeks virus is",
    "tough it's cunning it will not give up",
    "sort of has a mind of its own uh and all",
    "the experts that we talked to",
    "for months now have said you know",
    "when the cold weather hits more people",
    "move inside we can't really be outside",
    "as much",
    "that's when we're going to see more more",
    "spread",
    "but i think it's important for us to",
    "look at before we look at the future",
    "and again no one can predict the future",
    "but we just",
    "i'll base this on what the experts tell",
    "me and",
    "people i talk to i spent all day",
    "yesterday on the phone talking to",
    "more people many of them around around",
    "the country who have been following this",
    "very",
    "very very closely i think it's important",
    "though to talk",
    "first about what we've achieved because",
    "we've achieved a lot you have achieved a",
    "lot",
    "ohioans have done exceedingly well",
    "during this if you compare us",
    "with other countries uh if you compare",
    "us with some other states",
    "you know we're doing we're doing pretty",
    "well and what we've really avoided",
    "because of what ohioans have done and",
    "what they've not done",
    "what we've really avoided is these this",
    "huge spike",
    "uh where we would see our hospitals uh",
    "overflowing",
    "uh we all remember first seeing those",
    "stories coming out of italy",
    "we've seen them come out of new york",
    "we've seen them come out of california",
    "in texas",
    "uh florida um more recently",
    "mississippi uh now we've seen you know",
    "high incidents up in",
    "south dakota north dakota so",
    "despite the great tragedy",
    "500 or excuse me 5 000 deaths",
    "many families who are a parent both",
    "parents are",
    "out of work we've seen small businesses",
    "close we've seen",
    "small businesses struggle we've seen an",
    "increase",
    "in in people with mental health problems",
    "so this",
    "virus is certainly not been benign and",
    "we have not been spared",
    "and the people of ohio have not been",
    "spared but",
    "because of what you have done we've",
    "gotten to where we are today",
    "and we're in better shape uh than we",
    "would have been",
    "uh if you hadn't made the sacrifices",
    "so many of you have worn masks no one",
    "wants to wear a mask we",
    "all get tired of it so many of you kept",
    "distance so many of you have done",
    "the really the basic things that we know",
    "that we have to do",
    "uh so i'm proud of of where we are not",
    "proud of me but i'm proud of",
    "what you have done um you've really made",
    "a big",
    "big big difference we've avoided these",
    "large",
    "outbreaks that other countries and other",
    "states have seen",
    "we've certainly seen more deaths then we",
    "want more cases than we want",
    "but we're doing well compared",
    "to many states and countries",
    "let's talk now about the future",
    "what is the future again no one can",
    "predict it",
    "but let me just talk about what uh the",
    "experts are telling me",
    "and best that i can discern this",
    "um",
    "we talked we've talked in the past about",
    "it could be a tough winter",
    "could be a tough november december",
    "january",
    "uh because we're moving inside uh",
    "because we're also now seeing",
    "for the last two weeks some fairly",
    "significant",
    "spread and spread through the greater",
    "part of ohio at a high",
    "at a high rate",
    "cases up positivity up hospital",
    "admissions",
    "are up plus the",
    "early first indicators doctor visits",
    "emergency room visits people with",
    "covet-like symptoms these are",
    "going up very very fast",
    "but i think the thing that we should",
    "remember we can control a lot of this",
    "can't control it all virus is not going",
    "to go away",
    "until we get the vaccine until we get",
    "the herd immunity",
    "but we can control and mitigate a lot",
    "of this we've done it before and we can",
    "do it again",
    "ohioans are tough we're resilient we're",
    "workers",
    "we focus um",
    "when the goals are clear when the goals",
    "are clear",
    "when we set our sights on those goals",
    "when we set our sights on victory we can",
    "in fact do it and have done it",
    "to paraphrase something a science",
    "reporter wrote yesterday",
    "that i read how we come out of this",
    "the final death toll from proven 19",
    "for example how it impacts",
    "all of us with jobs and business",
    "will really depend on",
    "both what we do all of us do",
    "right here in ohio and it will also",
    "depend",
    "on how quickly we get the vaccine and",
    "frankly how well",
    "it works most of us",
    "in ohio are not scientists most of us",
    "are not involved in this effort although",
    "some ohioans are",
    "[Music]",
    "so we can't most of us control that but",
    "what we can control is what",
    "we do let's talk about",
    "what we do know about the vaccine",
    "look we have every indication that",
    "president trump's",
    "operation warp speed uh which is being",
    "subsidized uh",
    "to with a lot of money",
    "uh where they're subsidizing vaccine",
    "companies",
    "clinical trials and manufacturing costs",
    "um we have every indication is working",
    "as new york times reported yesterday the",
    "operation is and i quote",
    "working with a remarkable efficiency",
    "doesn't mean there won't be glitches",
    "doesn't mean",
    "it'll be perfect but it seems to be",
    "coming along",
    "and so it is coming and judging by all",
    "the indicators uh it will work",
    "um as i said we aren't the scientists we",
    "can't control the development of this",
    "vaccine that's beyond our ability",
    "the money's been put in the right people",
    "are working on it",
    "and they're working on it exceedingly",
    "hard",
    "here's what we can control it does come",
    "back to the basics",
    "we can control what we do every day we",
    "can control keeping a distance from",
    "other people",
    "we can we can control whether or not we",
    "assume that other people who we are",
    "seeing",
    "might have that virus and that we back",
    "off",
    "keep the distance we can control as i",

    "whether we keep the distance we can",
    "control whether we wash our hands",
    "whether we take all the normal",
    "precautions and what we do collectively",

    "next",
    "few months are going to be",
    "if we could get mass compliance up 85 90",
    "percent in this state",
    "every county we would fundamentally",
    "change what the next",
    "few months will be like",
    "so as we look forward uh you know",
    "no one knows exactly how long this is",
    "going to take with the vaccine",
    "so we don't know how much longer we're",
    "gonna have to do this",
    "um but several people i've talked to and",
    "things i could read uh you know indicate",
    "that",
    "you know by summer",
    "this coming summer you know we could be",
    "in a position where",
    "we're getting it out the vaccine out in",
    "in",
    "a large large section of uh",
    "our state of ohio",
    "what should be our goals as we move",
    "forward",
    "we got to keep our economy moving",

    "choir whatever their their passion is",
    "what we do in our communities will",

    "and if we allow that virus to flare up",
    "in our community it is going to go in",
    "to our schools it's the same way with",
    "our nursing homes",
    "when nursing homes are hit they're hit",
    "because someone is bringing that in",
    "not not obviously on purpose but they're",
    "coming in",

    "this boo-boo it's love in its purest",
    "form",
    "in addition in the coming days the ohio",

    "vaccines",
    "we cannot let cova 19 prevent us from",
    "meeting our essential",
    "health care needs please contact your",
    "pediatrician or your health department",
    "today",
    "to schedule these important well-child",
    "visits",
    "today i've asked dr",
    "chris peltier a doctor from cincinnati",
    "children's medical center",
    "to join us to tell us more about the",
    "importance of childhood",
    "vaccines doctor is also a provider at",
    "pediatric associates of mount carmel and",
    "president-elect",
    "the ohio chapter of the american academy",
    "of pediatrics doctor thank you",
    "very much for joining us thanks for",
    "having me again governor",
    "tell us a little bit about just in",
    "general what's going on with childhood",
    "vaccinations i know that some doctors",
    "have expressed some concerns about",
    "uh you know maybe not having enough",
    "families come in yet",
    "and maybe tell us a little bit about",
    "what you're seeing",
    "uh but also just tell us the basics tell",
    "us why why is this very important",
    "definitely i'd be glad to so as a result",
    "of the pandemic as you mentioned vaccine",
    "rates are definitely plummeting",
    "not only here in ohio but across the",
    "country we know that during the shutdown",
    "last spring",
    "well child visits to pediatricians fell",
    "which ultimately",
    "in addition to many other things like",
    "not being able to do vision and hearing",
    "screens",
    "ultimately to the rates of vaccinations",
    "many families were obviously worried",
    "about going to",
    "their pediatrician or their family",
    "doctor was it safe",
    "and we know i want to share with you",
    "some data so from",
    "january through april the cdc reported a",
    "cumulative decrease",
    "in 2.5 million doses of vaccines that",
    "were administered",
    "and just looking at the measles months",
    "rubella vaccine",
    "the cdc noted a national decrease in",
    "over 350",
    "000 visits there's a national group of",
    "independent pediatricians",
    "that it really involves about a thousand",
    "pediatricians that share the same",
    "electronic health record",
    "and some data from that company showed",
    "that",
    "decreases in the diphtheria tetanus and",
    "whooping cough vaccine",
    "dropped almost 50 percent up through",
    "april",
    "and the hpv or human papillomavirus",
    "vaccine rates dropped",
    "by almost 75 percent",
    "as you said it definitely is improving",
    "and we",
    "are seeing well visits return to higher",
    "levels than they were during the spring",
    "but in many practices that's still not",
    "up to",
    "100 percent or where it's been and not",
    "only that but now we're having to try to",
    "get in families that delayed their well",
    "child business and their vaccinations",
    "uh when when ohio was shut down",
    "so why is it important i mean i think we",
    "all know just",
    "intuitively this is important but what",
    "what are the consequences if if our",
    "numbers are not where they need to be",
    "and if we don't hit a certain level of",
    "uh children with these vaccinations",
    "right so",
    "the ultimate outcome is that we run the",
    "risk of an outbreak of vaccine",
    "preventable illnesses",
    "like whooping cough like measles and a",
    "worsening flu epidemic than we normally",
    "would have you may have seen",
    "the american academy of pediatrics has a",
    "an infographic that they've been",
    "publishing on social media",
    "trying to prevent what they call a",
    "twindemic so you know you",
    "very sadly demonstrated where we're at",
    "in the fight against kovid we are at the",
    "very beginning of influenza season",
    "and you know we worry that if",
    "we aren't vaccinating against things",
    "like measles",
    "whooping cough influenza we're gonna see",
    "greater closures in schools we're gonna",
    "have more impact",
    "on the economic outcomes for parents and",
    "caregivers",
    "and i think most importantly there's",
    "going to be a strain on the already",
    "taxed health system due to covid",
    "to care for these children there's an",
    "interesting study that was published",
    "recently in the",
    "european journal lancet that that really",
    "looked at trying to put in perspective",
    "and what they the the data that they",
    "found",
    "showed that for parents that are worried",
    "about bringing their children to",
    "their pediatrician for risk of getting",
    "coveted",
    "for every one death",
    "that could be attributed to covid that",
    "could potentially",
    "be caught by going to your health care",
    "provider",
    "in delaying vaccinations 84",
    "deaths in children could be prevented",
    "from other vaccine preventable illnesses",
    "like whooping cough",
    "measles and flu now of course we're not",
    "you know one death is too many but it",
    "just sort of puts it in",
    "in perspective when we're saying you",
    "know if a parent doesn't want to bring",
    "their child to the pediatrician for fear",
    "they may get exposed to covid",
    "you know that one possible prevention of",
    "a death",
    "could result in 84 other preventable",
    "deaths due to other",
    "other illnesses failure to vaccinate",
    "against these ki",
    "failure to vaccinate against these",
    "diseases leaves our ohio children",
    "unnecessarily vulnerable and with covet",
    "19 transmissions running high as you so",
    "eloquently stated at the beginning of",
    "this press conference",
    "it's more important to vaccinate kids",
    "against all preventable vaccine",
    "illnesses but also influenza",
    "the american academy of pediatric",
    "recommends that everybody age six months",
    "and up",
    "should be vaccinated against influenza",
    "ideally by halloween we have the",
    "the ohio aap has a social media campaign",
    "right now",
    "no boo without flu so trying to get your",
    "flu vaccine",
    "um by halloween uh and and",
    "whooping cough is not something that we",
    "think exists anymore but",
    "it does right we've had occasionally",
    "there's an outbreak that you'll see",
    "somewhere",
    "in the country and sometimes maybe even",
    "even ohio i think",
    "so we see we see outbreaks every year",
    "it's probably the",
    "most common vaccine preventable illness",
    "that we see every year",
    "we have outbreaks in our local schools",
    "and the significance of women cough is",
    "what tell us about it",
    "so you know it in older",
    "children it can cause as soon as 100 day",
    "cough so kids can have",
    "sort of this nagging cough they may feel",
    "sick the biggest thing is they're",
    "contagious so they have to be isolated",
    "during their contagious period",
    "the real risk is in young infants and",
    "babies",
    "and that whooping cough can cause young",
    "infants to stop breathing",
    "and ultimately we see deaths every year",
    "from whooping cough in young infants",
    "wow and pretty much preventable right",
    "exactly good doctor thank you for",
    "joining us",
    "you're right last question if anybody's",

    "going back to march when this all began",
    "did you ever imagine",
    "we would get to this point ever and",
    "secondly",
    "do you have any inkling as to what",
    "percentage of the five thousand",
    "perhaps those people those victims",
    "had other medical problems other",
    "complications",
    "and some way to put this in perspective",
    "so that people understand",
    "who is actually suffering the most from",
    "this",
    "well jim first of all i don't think any",
    "of us had an idea where this was going",
    "we saw some projections",
    "um you know some of the projections were",
    "higher than this",
    "uh i think it's a tribute to the people",
    "the state of ohio that",
    "we didn't it hasn't been more than this",
    "uh if we wouldn't been wearing masks if",
    "we people would not have been",
    "careful initially if they had not",
    "basically isolated",
    "then when we opened the economy back up",
    "if they hadn't been",
    "many of them wearing mask as they are",
    "today uh these deaths numbers would have",
    "been significantly higher i don't think",
    "there's any doubt about that but no i",
    "mean it was hard to envision",
    "and you know that many deaths uh as far",
    "as",
    "um what percentage of these",
    "5 000 people had an other medical",
    "problem",
    "i can't answer that but we do know",
    "that a large number of those individuals",
    "were over 70.",
    "uh we also know that many many of them",
    "who say we're not over 70 had some other",
    "medical problem so i think that's",
    "that's pretty pretty plain but it",
    "doesn't",
    "at least for me and i hope for most",
    "people",
    "changed the fact that these were fellow",
    "ohioans who are alive",
    "who had people who loved them who had a",
    "life ahead",
    "who were seemed to be doing okay",
    "and some of whom may have lived many",
    "many years",
    "and they were taken away from us by this",
    "vicious",
    "virus so the each one of these lives is",
    "is precious uh and i know you did not",
    "say this",
    "but sometimes people say to me uh well",
    "he was over 70. or he was sick",
    "already or she was sick already",
    "well they're still human beings they",
    "still have people that love them they",
    "love people they had a future they",
    "wanted a future",
    "their family wanted them around uh and",
    "sadly they are they're gone",
    "uh that is not to mention when we talk",
    "about the 5 000 that's not to mention",
    "the people who've just gone through hell",
    "and we've had several of them on",
    "skyped in uh who thought they might die",
    "who were separated from their family for",
    "months",
    "and who made it and so we're blessed to",
    "have them back but they suffered greatly",
    "we also have people",
    "uh who have recovered but who have",
    "term uh damage lung capacity",
    "uh organ some organ damage so the 5 000",
    "is each one's a person each one's a",
    "picture",
    "each one um you know was a great tragedy",
    "but there's also a lot of other people",
    "among us who have suffered",
    "who don't show up in that column but",
    "they come certainly come in another",
    "column",
    "next question is from dustin nsinger at",
    "gangwar news service",
    "good afternoon governor the state has so",
    "far managed to avoid tapping into the",
    "rainy day fund but you previously said",
    "that you expect to use all 2.7 billion",
    "dollars",
    "is that still the plan and do you have",
    "any specifics on where you would like to",
    "use that money to fill",
    "gaps well money's fungible i mean you",
    "can move it around",
    "so you know it's going to",
    "enable us to provide basic services",
    "starting with education",
    "um to the citizens of the state of ohio",
    "so we've taken a conservative approach",
    "i'll be honest about that",
    "um you know we think you know while i'm",
    "optimistic about what's going to happen",
    "whether it's next july or whenever it is",
    "that this virus",
    "uh you know we have the hurt immunity",
    "and we're",
    "you know moving forward uh even a lot",
    "faster than we are today",
    "you know i think we're going to rebound",
    "fast i think we're going to come back",
    "but i don't know that for sure and uh",
    "you know we're going to spend all this",
    "we believe we'll spend all this money",
    "over the next several years",
    "and it will be there primarily to do",
    "what a rainy day fund is for",
    "and that is to make sure that basic",
    "services are provided to the people of",
    "ohio particularly those people who are",
    "the most in need",
    "and so our our plan has not changed",
    "our our plan would be to spend it uh",
    "probably probably spend all of it but",
    "spend it over a period",
    "of probably a couple years you know what",
    "we did",
    "to get through the first to end up last",
    "year",
    "you know we made a cut made some cuts",
    "and you know we pulled some other things",
    "back in we did a hiring freeze we did",
    "other things we got on top of it early",
    "but we wanted to save this money frankly",
    "so that we could level that out",
    "as we as we move forward that's still",
    "our goal",
    "next question is from jeff reddick at",
    "wsyx in columbus",
    "good afternoon again governor uh two",
    "questions for you",
    "one of them being you said a lot off the",
    "top about it's going to get rough",
    "we need to prepare to get rough you've",
    "said in the past we won't shut the",
    "economy down again",
    "would that be in any way no restrictions",
    "on",
    "businesses that would cause shutdowns",
    "secondly we're seeing a lot about the",
    "states are not number going up could you",
    "go over",
    "what you know of it is it continuing to",
    "rise",
    "yeah there are not numbers about two",
    "weeks behind",
    "just by by its nature um",
    "and so yeah you're seeing you're seeing",
    "it go up uh",
    "it is we don't like that it's above one",
    "statewide but not a lot above one",
    "statewide uh but again it's a lagging",
    "it's a really a lagging",
    "uh number and it's an important number",
    "we look at it",
    "it's on my 42 pages that i get every",
    "morning",
    "when i get up uh but it's um",
    "you know it's one of many indicators i",
    "mean it's one of the indicators when i",
    "said every indicator is going the wrong",
    "way",
    "that included the are not number uh",
    "which is what what",
    "what that spread is um",
    "you referenced the first part of your",
    "question i think to",
    "you know potential uh shutdown and let",
    "me just",
    "make it real clear",
    "when i say we're going to have a tough",
    "winter this is pretty much what",
    "you know we're seeing numbers go the",
    "wrong way in ohio",
    "uh and by the way we're not alone we're",
    "seeing these numbers i talked to a",
    "number of governors yesterday",
    "on the phone midwest governors",
    "i talked to governor cuomo talked with",
    "governor",
    "beshear whitmer and and on and on",
    "and these these states are a lot of",
    "these states particularly the midwest",
    "are seeing",
    "the same things we're seeing we're",
    "seeing a real upswing in the rural areas",
    "more generally more than the urban uh",
    "and they're seeing an",
    "increase in cases so we're all kind of",
    "seeing the same",
    "the same thing",
    "but we can the point that i want to make",
    "sure",
    "i get across is that when i say it's",
    "going to be a rough winter it could be a",
    "rough winter it's based on two things",
    "the numbers we're seeing now",
    "and what the experts say what happens",
    "when you move inside",
    "but we can mitigate that a lot we can",
    "change that future",
    "dramatically and i will say what i've",
    "said",
    "other times while we have in some areas",
    "of the state",
    "very good mass wearing um i was on the",
    "phone this morning with",
    "most of our health directors and in some",
    "counties they're",
    "they're seeing a retrenchment they're",
    "seeing that mass worrying go down a",
    "little bit",
    "and you know if we can keep it up if we",
    "could do",
    "85 or so statewide",
    "every county this winter will be a lot",
    "easier",
    "and what really is at stake is all the",
    "things we value",
    "and it's not going to be whether i shut",
    "the state down or don't shut the state",
    "down",
    "if the outbreak is so bad that you can't",
    "put teachers in a classroom",
    "then you can't put students in a",
    "classroom these kids will be",
    "learning remotely whatever the school",
    "wants to do they will have to make they",
    "will ultimately make that decision",
    "out of necessity uh if the outbreak is",
    "is bad uh people will become even more",
    "nervous uh you know will become nervous",
    "about going out",
    "and they'll become nervous about",
    "spending money and so",
    "all of these things so much of our",
    "economy and so much of our future",
    "during the next three months or so",
    "depends on what we do",
    "you know i talked about two things are",
    "coming together",
    "uh never in the history of the countries",
    "or the world as far as i know as",
    "vaccines have been put together as",
    "quickly",
    "and we're not there yet but it looks",
    "like talking to you know you talk to the",
    "experts",
    "that we're on a pathway so we're going",
    "to get these",
    "uh and we can't control that that's what",
    "other people are doing",
    "but what we can control is what we do",
    "ourselves",
    "and that is back to basics",
    "uh one of the things i love loved about",
    "the coaches",
    "ad uh is because in this",
    "as in all sports it does come down",
    "really",
    "uh to your optimism to your heart",
    "and it comes back to doing the basics",
    "every sport everything you do in life",
    "it's about doing the basics",
    "we know what the basics are here and if",
    "we can do these basics we will change",
    "that outcome",
    "so i didn't come here today on this",
    "absolutely beautiful day in ohio",
    "uh to talk gloom",
    "i'm optimistic we've done well",
    "but it's a crucial period uh numbers are",
    "going the wrong way we're coming into",
    "winter",
    "and so we've got to buckle down and",
    "we've got to do what we need to do and",
    "when we do that",
    "that mask again becomes our ticket it's",
    "our ticket",
    "for our kids to play ball our grandkids",
    "my case uh it's our ticket",
    "uh for kids kids to be in school in",
    "person",
    "uh it's our ticket to be able to go out",
    "and about",
    "uh it's our ticket to be able to go to a",
    "restaurant go to a bar that's where our",
    "ticket is",
    "and if enough of us wear it we'll have",
    "the ability to do that if we don't",
    "it could be it could be a tough tough",
    "winter so",
    "the choice lies with us it really does",
    "all of us",
    "collectively you know 11.7 million",
    "ohioans",
    "it really comes down to what we do",
    "next question is from joe ingles at ohio",
    "public radio and television",
    "good afternoon governor",
    "i know you've said that you feel like",
    "the freedom of speech should be their",
    "political speech should be protected",
    "when candidates are coming to ohio",
    "but in many cases and especially",
    "cases involving president trump and and",
    "republican rallies",
    "um they are the people who come don't",
    "know",
    "observe the mask mandate the presenters",
    "themselves don't observe the mass",
    "mandate",
    "they ignore distance spacing and every",
    "time they come to ohio",
    "employees people who are not part of the",
    "event",
    "people who have nothing to do with",
    "having a choice to be there",
    "have to work in those conditions uh",
    "where that's not being practiced you are",
    "friends with with the republican leaders",
    "have you talked to them to at least urge",
    "them",
    "to follow the protocol and have you",
    "talked to the president",
    "to ask him to try to uh get",
    "you know people to wear masks and and",
    "practice",
    "uh more safe distancing and that sort of",
    "thing",
    "yeah it's it's no secret what my",
    "position is on mask",
    "i mean you know everybody in ohio is",
    "sick of me talking about mass",
    "and i think you know they understand at",
    "the white house what my position is",
    "as well but you know joe",
    "i want to take it one step further what",
    "you just said about a rally",
    "is the same thing about any other",
    "gathering",
    "and that is that people who don't wear a",
    "mask",
    "it's not just about protecting",
    "themselves by not wearing a mask they",
    "could very well be endangering other",
    "people",
    "who they don't know who they you know",
    "who aren't the art related to",
    "let alone relate to the people they're",
    "related to so",
    "you know our message has been clear uh",
    "crystal clear",
    "uh from black lives matter from",
    "demonstrations",
    "uh to trump rallies to chur",
    "church gatherings and that has been",
    "please wear a mask",
    "um you know and the evidence is",
    "overwhelming",
    "the jury is returned there is no it is a",
    "unanimous verdict",
    "and that is that mass do in fact work um",
    "and you know there are some there is",
    "some evidence now um",
    "that not only do they help the other",
    "person",
    "not only do they help you getting it",
    "uh but if",
    "you're wearing you're wearing a mask and",
    "let's say you're out",
    "and you know the other person maybe is",
    "not wearing a mask you get",
    "some of this there's some indication",
    "from some scientists",
    "that the severity of",
    "how well or how much you how much you",
    "suffer",
    "how severe is that case may be related",
    "may be mitigated and taken down by that",
    "by that mask",
    "so we're clear on the message",
    "you know we can't control everything um",
    "you know the biggest",
    "cause of spread that we're seeing uh",
    "is people uh you know when they're with",
    "friends and family",
    "uh places they feel comfortable and uh",
    "you know they let their guard down as we",
    "all do when people when we're with",
    "friends and we're the family we all let",
    "our guard down but the message is we",
    "can't do that",

    "more people in icu and more people",

    "fire department come and put it out",
    "and that's when the vaccine is here and",
    "we get",
    "widespread use of the vaccine",
    "but until the firemen get here",
    "we've got to control it ourselves and we",
    "control it ourselves with mass",
    "and distance and i cannot",
    "underestimate or can't state strongly",
    "enough",
    "we have it in our hands to control how",
    "much this flares up",
    "when you saw those counties in some",
    "counties at three times now",
    "the level of high incidence three times",
    "it doesn't have to be that way if",
    "tomorrow",
    "everybody in those counties those top 10",

    "counties everybody put on a mask",
    "everybody keep a distance you can knock",
    "this thing down",
    "in two weeks and your numbers would",
    "start going down",
    "there's absolutely no doubt about we've",
    "seen it happen in ohio",
    "time and time again when a community has",
    "done that",
    "the cases go down it's not rocket",
    "science",
    "next question is from danny eldridge at",
    "hannah news service",
    "hello governor um so there's about 900",
    "million dollars left in the state share",
    "of the cares act can you talk a little",
    "bit about what your plans are for that",
    "money i know",
    "uh arch groups in particular are looking",
    "for uh",
    "funding from that yeah we we hope to",
    "have some money we will have some money",
    "for the arts we'll have",
    "because we know they've been hit very",
    "hard uh we hope to have some money for",
    "other non-profits uh we hope to have",
    "money",
    "uh for small other small businesses and",
    "we hope to have money",
    "for people who are paying rent and are",
    "behind in their rent or behind in their",
    "mortgage",
    "uh so those are we've already put some",
    "money out",
    "uh in regard to mental health",
    "and we're monitoring that um you know we",
    "put out the money that we think can be",
    "spent",
    "between now and the end of the year uh",
    "if this money can be carried over which",
    "we hope it will be and we think that",
    "congress in a lame duck session will",
    "uh vote on a bill if they vote on any",
    "bill i'm told",
    "by our our congressional delegation",
    "there will be a rollover provision in",
    "the bill",
    "uh and then we'll be able to take some",
    "of that money into next year uh when",
    "we're also going to have mental health",
    "concerns where our colleges are also",
    "going to need additional funds uh so for",
    "this year in addition to the things i",
    "talked about we also look to have some",
    "additional money for for our colleges",
    "and our universities so",
    "we have plans what makes it difficult uh",
    "is we still don't know for sure whether",
    "we can roll this money over or whether",
    "we would be in a position",
    "of trying to spend it between now and",
    "the end of the year which would not be a",
    "prudent way to do it it would not be the",
    "most",
    "uh logical way to",
    "to to do that so we're kind of balancing",
    "these things but we have needs now that",
    "we're going to",
    "we're going to get covered we're working",
    "with the state legislature and we should",
    "have a specific announcement",
    "uh about what we're doing shortly",
    "next question is from boniface walmer at",
    "eye on ohio",
    "good afternoon governor um my",
    "question for you is going back to the",
    "vaccinations",
    "um when when you finally receive a",
    "vaccination",
    "how long do you expect it to take before",
    "you can roll it out to all of ohio",
    "well that's an excellent question i",
    "don't know the answer",
    "but i have a general answer and this is",
    "from talking to",
    "the vice president and and talking to",
    "doctors",
    "um you know we think that these",
    "vaccinations will come in waves",
    "um and it looks like most of the ones",
    "that are being worked on",
    "require two shots i think one of the",
    "main ones being worked on is a three",
    "week period between the first shot",
    "and the second shot another one is a",
    "four week period between the first shot",
    "and in the second and the second shot um",
    "you know some of them require uh you",
    "know deep deep freeze",
    "uh but they're gonna come out in",
    "containers that can be can and hold them",
    "um and you know we've already are",
    "working on the distribution",
    "chain we would expect that the first",
    "group that would come out you know will",
    "certainly be",
    "focused on uh critical first responders",
    "and by that i mean people people who are",
    "you know who are right on the front line",
    "um it also you know very early on will",
    "be people who",
    "are the most vulnerable uh that",
    "certainly is anybody",
    "who's living in a you know people who",
    "are living in a congregate setting",
    "such as nursing homes so we think it's",
    "going to come out in waves and it's",
    "going to pick up faster and faster",
    "probably as it goes no one knows how",
    "long this is going to take but",
    "you know several knowledgeable people",
    "who've looked at this",
    "have told me by june or late june",
    "they would project that we would be in",
    "widespread distribution",
    "you know to people all over the country",
    "not just in niche groups or smaller",
    "groups but it would be widespread now",
    "look those",
    "you know those dates are just no one",
    "really knows",
    "people are trying to kind of figure it",
    "out but uh",
    "you know we're moving towards uh you",
    "know",
    "working on it so no matter when it comes",
    "out we'll be ready to get it out and our",
    "goal will be to",
    "obviously get these out just as soon as",
    "we get our hands on them",
    "next question is from max philby at the",
    "columbus dispatch",
    "max hey governor um i remember a month",
    "ago you were warning ohioans um with",
    "labor day approaching",
    "that uh if they weren't careful we could",
    "see cases spike again",
    "so i'm curious if you believe that the",
    "spike we're currently seeing",
    "is the result of labor day and if that",
    "could lead to any more",
    "um measures that your administration",
    "might implement",
    "since we've got a few more holiday",
    "weekends coming up before the end of the",
    "year",
    "yeah i think max is that's too",
    "simplistic i mean",
    "certainly labor day and activities could",
    "have been a partial cause",
    "you know you had a lot of things going",
    "on as you know in the week or two before",
    "schools were opening back up and",
    "colleges were opening back up and our",
    "colleges have kind of phased in",
    "uh you know some of the colleges opened",
    "up entirely in person and some kind of",
    "phased that",
    "in so we're well into all of that now",
    "uh and you know what we think we're",
    "seeing as we're seeing an",
    "uptick now in the age",
    "which is different than it's been for a",
    "number of months that we're seeing kind",
    "of a rebound",
    "so you know you get a college 20 year",
    "old college student who has got infected",
    "he or she might not even know they have",
    "it they pass it on to",
    "an older person and we think we're",
    "seeing that second phase",
    "of that uh possibly taking place but",
    "it's very difficult to",
    "you know to drill down and and to",
    "quantify that so",
    "um again um",
    "you know you asked your other question",
    "was you know",
    "is that going to inform us to do",
    "anything in in particular",
    "uh and what it informs me to do",
    "is to just emphasize to people we",
    "control this this is in our",
    "in our our in our collective hands i",
    "mean when you think about it",
    "if if we're correct that",
    "so much of this is coming about from",
    "people who are with family and with",
    "friends whether the wedding",
    "or a funeral or",
    "a barbecue or any kind of things that",
    "people do",
    "you know government has very little way",
    "to impact that other than to tell people",
    "here's what's going on in your county",
    "here are the numbers in your county",
    "and in second here's what you can do",
    "about it",
    "and you know telling them",
    "we know this works we have evidence that",
    "works we have evidence in ohio it works",
    "as well as national evidence so you know",
    "if you just listen to the experts you",
    "know there's dr fauci who",
    "who said i think one of our uh leading",
    "doctors uh",
    "you know said basically that uh uh",
    "now there's another doctor whose name",
    "but anyway basically said that the",
    "the mask in in some respects is going to",
    "be more",
    "redfield i think uh mask is gonna be",
    "more powerful than the",
    "immunization i don't know about that but",
    "it just tells you how much she thinks",
    "this mass",
    "is worth and we saw it on numbers",
    "i mean we can show you graphs we can",
    "show you what happened",
    "uh when our early cities for example put",
    "on",
    "mass orders and then we came we came in",
    "right shortly after that",
    "and put in a mass score for the entire",
    "county and you can see what happened",
    "in those counties and it's phenomenal",
    "you started to seeing",
    "the mask worrying go up dramatically and",
    "then you start seeing cases go down",
    "that doesn't mean they don't struggle",
    "doesn't mean they still don't have",
    "problems",
    "but we know we can show or the mask",
    "worrying in ohio has fundamentally",
    "changed the outcome",
    "and look we're not trying to be alarmist",
    "but if you're a county with",
    "two and a half times three times the",
    "positivity",
    "there's no way it doesn't get into your",
    "schools there's no way it doesn't get",
    "into your most vulnerable people",
    "as your your loved ones your",
    "grandparents your great-grandparents",
    "your aunts your uncles who are in the",
    "nursing homes so",
    "you know it's imperative if you live in",
    "one of those counties",
    "to get control of this virus and it's",
    "not that",
    "hard it is simply you know",
    "erecting barriers so it doesn't pass",
    "from one person to the other and and the",
    "best you know this is amazing barrier",
    "uh and when both people are wearing them",
    "it's it's it's really really",
    "good next question is from justin dennis",
    "at mahoningmatters.com",
    "hi governor um since we're talking about",
    "mass the mass mandate has been difficult",
    "to enforce at the local level and",
    "if this is as you say our ticket away",
    "from the dangers of the pandemic",
    "how can you uh strengthen enforcement",
    "measures is there anything new that we",
    "can do",
    "to ensure compliance um aside from from",
    "leaving it up to everyone to",
    "to make their own decision yeah i mean",
    "we're gonna you know where we have the",
    "most",
    "ability to control uh it's frankly in",
    "any establishment that sells liquor",
    "because we can send in agents",
    "and we do uh and if they're not",
    "following mass compliance or they're not",
    "following",
    "distance requirements then those agents",
    "can can cite them into the state liquor",
    "board",
    "so in in those cases doesn't mean we",
    "catch everything but we have the ability",
    "certainly to go in and and to do that",
    "uh but where we're seeing you know a",
    "great great bulk of this",
    "spread is is families and and people",
    "just hey doing things that normally are",
    "great things to do um our message is you",
    "can still do those",
    "but you just got to be careful and fran",
    "i've been a few funerals in the last",
    "couple few weeks unfortunately and you",
    "can do them you can do them safely",
    "uh and everybody can and you can pay",
    "honor to the",
    "loved one and see the family and do",
    "these things but",
    "when you're talking about enforcement",
    "there is a limit to what government",
    "should do",
    "and there's a limit to what government",
    "can do and uh you know",
    "we can't go into someone's backyard you",
    "know we can't go inside their home",
    "we can't go inside that fraternity home",
    "uh we",
    "you know these are these are things that",
    "we don't have the people to do it",
    "but again if we're gonna get through",
    "this",
    "and whatever you like to do whatever is",
    "important to you",
    "wearing a mask and keeping distance is",
    "the way to preserve the ability to do",
    "that",
    "and we're going to continue to talk",
    "about that and in",
    "events that we can control uh sporting",
    "events for example you know it's",
    "incumbent upon the people to enforce it",
    "who run it when they don't run it that",
    "way then that there's a problem",
    "so we can do this in some areas but when",
    "people's most",
    "personal private things what parts of",
    "life",
    "where we're seeing the most spread",
    "frankly",
    "it's tough it's not easy",
    "next question is from tom jackson at the",
    "sandusky register",
    "hey tom hi governor thanks for taking my",
    "question um as you pointed out we're",
    "getting a big rise",
    "in cases although fortunately deaths",
    "have not been spiking",
    "can you give me an idea uh on whether",
    "any lockdown measures",
    "are likely to be brought back this",
    "winter if things keep going",
    "south for example could there be more",
    "restrictions on bars and restaurants",
    "if uh your appeals for people to follow",
    "social distancing and aware",
    "mass don't seem to be having any effect",
    "yeah i mean i think there could be but i",
    "think the more likely thing to happen",
    "is that the market itself people",
    "themselves",
    "will will react",
    "and i use the example of schools we've",
    "seen some schools",
    "that started open five days a week",
    "who've now pulled back at least",
    "temporarily",
    "maybe maybe to totally virtual or to a",
    "hybrid",
    "why have they done it well they had some",
    "outbreaks they had some cases they",
    "couldn't",
    "put teachers in in a classroom or they",
    "were you know had too many students who",
    "were",
    "who were out so that's what's going to",
    "happen this virus",
    "will have have the impact right on the",
    "ground right at the local level",
    "and people will have to adjust to that",
    "so you know again the best way to stop",
    "that from doing is",
    "people in the community to understand",
    "what they do directly impacts what goes",
    "on that nursing home or directly impacts",
    "what goes on in that in that school",
    "i want to i want to mention something",
    "about the deaths because you make you",
    "make a good",
    "point um you know i think that and i i",
    "said this early on",
    "um if you can avoid if if you had to get",
    "this",
    "you'd want to get it as late as you",
    "could in the game because medical",
    "science is",
    "getting better and better they're",
    "learning uh they know what",
    "drugs to use and what things to use",
    "there's no cure but",
    "they can mitigate the damage and they",
    "can save more lives so we would continue",
    "to expect",
    "i think our medical professionals would",
    "say this that they will continue to",
    "expect to",
    "save more lives the further along in",
    "this that we go",
    "but the other thing to keep in mind",
    "before we get too happy about",
    "how we're doing uh or too optimistic uh",
    "is that deaths are of course the last",
    "indicator it's the",
    "the lagging lagging indicator i mean you",
    "go",
    "you go through a long process and you",
    "know someone you know is infected",
    "someone then notices it or somehow they",
    "take a test and now they know they've",
    "got it",
    "and at some point they get so bad they",
    "go to the hospital",
    "and then you know they may be in the",
    "hospital for an extended period of time",
    "we hope they get out but if they end up",
    "dying that may be in",
    "that you know bigger period of time so",
    "they're the lagging lagging lagging",
    "indicators so when you see these numbers",
    "as high as they are today",
    "um you know we may see those results you",
    "know",
    "two three four weeks weeks away so",
    "uh we're doing better uh in you know not",
    "because of me but because of what",
    "doctors and scientists are doing",
    "but um we're still losing people",
    "and there's no cure that we know of",
    "next question is from jackie borchardt",
    "at the cincinnati enquirer",
    "jackie good afternoon um governor you",
    "said earlier that if we got to 80 to 90",
    "compliance for wearing masks and",
    "counties that would make a huge",
    "difference where are we at now and how",
    "are you measuring that",
    "that's a good question you know there",
    "are some",
    "apps that are supposedly doing this i've",
    "never been quite sure how reliable they",
    "are",
    "i will tell you what we do on this",
    "morning 7 15",
    "call with the health departments i ask",
    "each one of them to report to us",
    "today um what they think their",
    "mass compliance is in their community",
    "and i'll be happy to share those with",
    "you all um on thursday",
    "uh it varies and it varies within the",
    "county",
    "uh here's what some of my district reps",
    "who i've sent out and",
    "they're not health experts but they just",
    "have gone out and just looked",
    "and what they'll say is that in the",
    "rural counties for urban counties has",
    "the most compliance generally",
    "you get out into the rural counties uh",
    "the county seat has less than the urban",
    "areas but more than",
    "the rest of the county so you go into a",
    "county and the county seat will have the",
    "highest",
    "highest rate of compliance you know",
    "maybe 40",
    "50 uh and but then when you go out into",
    "the smaller communities it may go down",
    "to 10",
    "or less um it also depends on the type",
    "store",
    "uh you know what they tell us is that",
    "grocery stores do pretty well the",
    "highest incidence",
    "uh the highest compliance level is",
    "probably in the grocery stores",
    "for whatever reason convenience stores",
    "on the other hand",
    "uh are some of the lowest that's what's",
    "reported to us",
    "this is consistent county to county uh i",
    "don't know whether",
    "you know why that is but again it's",
    "it matters it makes a great deal of",
    "difference",
    "um you know we got frontline workers uh",
    "they're not all",
    "in the medical field or the nursing home",
    "field we have front line workers who",
    "work in grocery stores and um you know",
    "somebody's out stalking shelves and",
    "they've got a mask on and you don't",
    "and everybody else doesn't it's not fair",
    "it's not fair to them really it's not",
    "but",
    "we'll try to get you that and at least",
    "share with you what we have it",
    "again it's not that scientific but",
    "you can come fairly close um",
    "you know to knowing what's going on in",
    "the in the county",
    "next question is from jack windsor at",
    "wmfd",
    "in mansfield hey jack governor",
    "follow up on last week since then we've",
    "learned schools are not super spreaders",
    "according to a brown university study",
    "confirming what the cdc said in july",
    "lockdowns cause mass poverty and the",
    "benefits of normal education outweigh",
    "risks according to the world health",

    "contracted covet while only three",
    "percent of those who didn't mask",
    "contracted the virus according to the",
    "cdc and then bio next now",
    "the tests that you want to use in our",
    "schools are approved for off-label use",
    "but the test manufacturer does not",
    "recommend them for use on asymptomatic",
    "people",
    "and nearly all the children who are",
    "positive or asymptomatic we're also",
