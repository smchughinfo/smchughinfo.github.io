    "friends we must remember",
    "that whenever there's more activity",
    "we're going to see more cases",

    "our communities",
    "we saw a lot of movement around the",
    "state over the fourth of july weekend",
    "and then",
    "after that we saw a significant spread",

    "many of this was comes out of what you'd",

    "gatherings being with friends to",
    "celebrate the holiday",
    "we know it takes about a week or maybe",
    "two for people to develop symptoms after",
    "coming into contact with someone who is",
    "contagious",
    "uh we should remember that some people",
    "may not show symptoms of being sick",
    "at all and they can be contagious",
    "cases and positivity were already going",
    "up in june after",
    "we reopened as people got together",
    "though during the fourth of july",
    "we saw our cases increase even more by",
    "mid-july we were averaging close to 1500",
    "cases per day",
    "and our positivity rate was an average",
    "of 6.5",
    "percent eric let's look at this slide",
    "this is a slide we showed you before",
    "we talked about this case before i want",
    "to show you again",
    "as an example of just how a kind of",
    "benign",
    "what would seem to be a benign uh happy",
    "trip",
    "uh to a lake result in significant",
    "community spread a couple with their",
    "daughter and a family friend",
    "rode in the same vehicle on a 40-minute",
    "trip to a lake",
    "in ohio the family friend had covered 19",
    "but she did not know it at the time",
    "as you can see from this graphic uh that",
    "case led to an additional",
    "nine cases it also led to the temporary",
    "closing of three businesses",
    "a vacation employee from one of those",
    "businesses was quarantined in a hotel",
    "room",
    "and another was told on her wedding day",
    "that she faced possible quarantine",
    "and the daughter from the car ride who",
    "was trying to get her first teaching job",
    "had her hiring process delayed",
    "more recently other cases just in the",
    "past few weeks we've heard from several",
    "of our local health departments about",
    "spread",
    "associated again with family friends",
    "gathering together",
    "for example in lake county the parent",
    "traveled out of state and came home the",
    "day before a birthday party that",
    "included high school athletes",
    "from multiple jurisdictions the parent",
    "got sick",
    "uh the day after the party and now there",
    "are four confirmed cases",

    "lake",
    "county example a group of teens who",
    "worked together at a grocery store",
    "attended a birthday party together in",
    "mid",
    "mid august there are now three",
    "associated cases",
    "to date and one person who",
    "does not have symptoms who's waiting for",
    "test results",
    "the attendees at the party have said",
    "that there were no masks",
    "no social distancing taking place at the",
    "party",
    "another case a neighbor attended a",
    "family card game in trumbull county with",
    "three members of the same family",
    "the neighbor got sick the day after the",
    "card game and now all the family members",

    "to their spouses",
    "putnam county there are now 10 cases",
    "associated with a large gulf outing",
    "held on august 21st",
    "but certainly not everything we're",
    "hearing is bad a lot",
    "a lot of good things that are in fact",
    "going on i'll share a couple stories",
    "in regard to that first of all let me",
    "just say i",
    "i truly believe that our schools uh k-12",
    "schools",
    "our colleges our universities uh planned",
    "for this",
    "uh and they're doing a very very good",
    "job i talked this morning",
    "uh to rush school superintendent steve",
    "rose",
    "uh who told me that their seventh to",
    "twelfth grade is now",
    "going remote gone remote because they",
    "had a case",
    "uh before they had one student uh who",
    "tested",
    "positive and that was due to communities",
    "spread",
    "as we've said before schools are going",
    "to have cases",
    "they're going to have positive cases",
    "because they're in the community and",
    "they reflect the community when there is",
    "widespread",
    "community spread uh there's going to be",
    "spread within those schools",
    "we should understand that when the data",
    "is published and when you see in the",
    "paper",
    "like last night i saw on on dayton tv",
    "about rushi uh that's why i called the",
    "superintendent this morning",
    "we see about that but what that really",
    "means is they're doing",
    "their job uh they're following protocol",
    "they're following their plan uh",
    "so in this case uh the urushi folks did",
    "a very very good job did exactly what",
    "what they should do and that's",
    "i think something we should all remember",
    "when we see that there is a",
    "case in a school all that means is that",
    "school's focused on it",
    "and they're doing the tracing and",
    "they're doing what they what they need",
    "to do",
    "another example in youngstown there are",
    "two catholic high schools that use",
    "youngstown state",
    "facilities for football games tickets",
    "for recent games were all pre-purchased",
    "uh only by families and loved ones of",
    "players cheerleaders and band members",
    "and the school sent daily reminders to",
    "parents",
    "about social distancing and masking",
    "the youngstown city school",
    "city health district purchased large",
    "signs to reinforce masking and social",
    "distancing",
    "and health department staff including",
    "the health commissioner the",
    "environmental health director and others",
    "worked during games offering free mass",
    "to anyone who did not have one and",
    "greeting fans with handouts and a",
    "message welcome",
    "mask on game on and please remember the",
    "social distance",
    "when in the stadium they also reinforced",
    "the message in the stands and the",
    "concession areas",
    "during games schools used the scoreboard",
    "and made numerous announcements to",
    "remind fans about social distancing and",
    "mask worrying",
    "one coach assigned players designated",
    "spots on the sidelines to ensure social",
    "distancing so from both these schools",
    "as well as the public schools that they",
    "hosted",
    "that was just really really great news",
    "and they followed the guidelines that",
    "they should that they should follow",
    "in canton a local football team had two",
    "players who were confirmed to have coven",
    "19.",
    "the players and coaches quickly isolated",
    "the players and notified the local",
    "health department",
    "the health department quickly",
    "quarantined those who had been in close",
    "contact with the two positive cases",
    "the outbreak and this is something that",
    "is significant",
    "the outbreak was limited to those two",
    "players with five people quarantined",
    "as a precaution the school had already",
    "implemented the recommended guidelines",
    "for",
    "player practices involving social",
    "distancing worrying of face coverings",
    "and more",
    "this is a great example of a school",
    "having a proper plan in place",
    "and executing that plan and cooperating",
    "with the local health officials to keep",
    "cover 19 in check",
    "again having a plan carrying out the",
    "plan",
    "and the cooperation can result",
    "in fewer people being quarantined we've",
    "seen examples occasionally when there's",
    "not the",
    "cooperation and you see a lot more",
    "people end up getting getting",
    "quarantined",
    "the toledo lucas county health",
    "department like so many of our health",
    "departments has worked with schools",
    "to send consistent messaging that",
    "students should not be attending",
    "mass ever gatherings and so we thank",
    "them for that",
    "in one instance a party was attended by",
    "students including athletes from two",
    "school districts",
    "the school said they would halt",
    "athletics if those in attendance did not",
    "come forward",
    "it was a clear message to everyone in",
    "the community",
    "holding or allowing parties is a",
    "liability to academics",
    "athletics and the spread of covid 19.",
    "another such party that had been planned",

    "which we do we want them",
    "uh doing other extracurricular",
    "activities um",
    "then the way to do that is for us to",
    "slow this spread down",
    "uh speaking of schools i want to turn uh",
    "to our education order the education",
    "order will be issued in the next several",
    "days last week i talked about issuing",
    "the order",
    "on reporting covet 19 in our schools",
    "as i said we're still working on the",
    "exact language of the order and we'll",
    "get it out shortly",
    "when it's complete we will of course",
    "post it on our coronavirus.ohio",
    "uh so everyone can read it but let me",
    "reiterate a couple of the goals or three",
    "of the goals",
    "that we have",
    "number one if you have a child",
    "in school and your child has come into",
    "contact with someone",
    "who later tests positive uh",
    "for for covid within the relevant period",
    "of time",
    "then you have every right to know that",
    "and so the school should notify you and",
    "will notify you",
    "of that fact second",
    "uh we want parents to know if there's",
    "anyone in their child's school building",
    "who has in fact tested positive",
    "so again not the specific names of",
    "course in any of these",
    "but we want the schools first of course",
    "contact the parents",
    "if they have come in contact with that",
    "child",
    "and they can work then with the local",
    "health department",
    "second though if you're just in the in",
    "the school building itself",
    "we want the school to notify the parents",
    "and third we want to notify the public",
    "once this has occurred and so that will",
    "be a report that will be issued",
    "by the state health department",
    "uh once a week our goal is to be as open",
    "as transparent as possible",
    "so families can be informed",
    "if there are if there are cases in",
    "school again it doesn't mean that",
    "anybody did anything wrong",
    "if they found the cases and are acting",
    "accordingly it means they're doing",
    "they're doing the things that that are",
    "right it's",
    "you're going to see many many cases in",
    "you're going to see many",
    "times when there are cases in schools",
    "just because of what we see",
    "in the community let's turn to our",
    "colleges",
    "in july we put out our guidance for ohio",
    "state public",
    "and private colleges universities and",
    "technical institutions to open in the",
    "safest",
    "way possible administrators have been",
    "planning and taking steps to allow for",
    "social distancing",
    "provide more living space on campuses",
    "and other measures",
    "now that students are returning to",
    "classes both in person and virtually we",
    "thought we would invite",
    "some students to share their experiences",
    "on campus",
    "first i'd like to introduce nicholas",
    "juan",
    "javi",
    "bose um air bows",
    "excuse me avi how you doing hey how are",
    "you doing governor",
    "i'm i'm i'm good hey thanks for joining",

    "graduated from cary high school in",
    "wyandotte county and you're going to",
    "school where now",
    "uh bowling green state university all",
    "right you want to tell us a little bit",
    "about",
    "the experience this year it's a little",
    "little different than",
    "past experiences yeah absolutely it's",
    "definitely been a different change",
    "uh from my previous three years at bgsu",
    "it's definitely with the detentification",
    "of our campus there's a lot less",
    "students",
    "on our campus which has been i think the",
    "biggest change in my experience",
    "uh however i know the things that we've",
    "done uh as",
    "bgsu and our return to campus plan has",
    "been for the benefit",
    "um to help us have uh this in-person",
    "instruction",
    "um and experience that we want to the",
    "the closest to",
    "a traditional college experience as we",
    "can and so it's definitely been a",
    "definite change",
    "but i think from my experience and",
    "discussions with my peers it's been",
    "going very very well and it's been an",
    "effective change",
    "to continue we have 13 weeks left and",
    "we are all in this together as bgsu and",
    "i hope we can continue to do that moving",
    "forward",
    "well you are i see that you're the",
    "studio body vice president",
    "you all managed to have an election",
    "somehow right yes",
    "that was that was definitely a change as",
    "well um a lot of not just",
    "the undergraduate student government but",
    "organizations in general",
    "um with everything changing and back in",
    "march",
    "i had to do a lot of a lot of quick",
    "changes in relation to",
    "to getting their new president's new",
    "leadership in the organization so a lot",
    "um as as classes as well all went",
    "virtual",
    "um so we did our best um as student",
    "leaders to be able to facilitate that in",
    "the most effective way",
    "so so tell me um uh javi tell me a",
    "little bit about the",
    "kind of the student attitude on campus i",
    "mean what",
    "how how are people dealing with this i",
    "mean this is",
    "it's just different but i mean what's",
    "what's what's the",
    "what's the attitude you think among most",
    "the students",
    "i think it's been relatively positive uh",
    "from",
    "a majority if not all the students",
    "the constant communication from whether",
    "it's professors and faculty members or",
    "the higher administration",
    "at our institution it's been a",
    "constant reassurance that we",
    "as students are first in mind when it",
    "comes to decisions that are being made",
    "i know there's been a little bit of a",
    "change within like student activities",
    "and student involvement",
    "but we we have done everything we",
    "possibly can with the",
    "while maintaining compliance to to",
    "continue that traditional experience",
    "with",
    "being able to meet in person as long as",
    "it's a",
    "maximum of ten individuals six feet",
    "physical distancing and facial coverings",
    "at all time",
    "all times we've created spaces where",
    "that can be done effectively to be able",
    "to have that",
    "experience it's just a lot of change as",
    "you as you noted",
    "but i think the overall attitude has",
    "been pretty positive",
    "because we have done very well as an",
    "institution to really maintain that",
    "traditional experience",
    "so are you taking some courses online",
    "yes uh so i have",
    "so bjc went with three different course",
    "delivery methods",
    "and so that's strictly online which is",
    "an asynchronous course it's a self-paced",
    "course we have a remote option which is",
    "a synchronous course so you meet at a",
    "certain time just at a remote location",
    "and then we have an in-person and hybrid",
    "course delivery method as well",
    "which is a little bit of both um where",
    "we go to class maintaining",
    "all the compliance set by our university",
    "and health organizations",
    "um but it's still able to have that",
    "in-person educational experience",
    "so i have one in the hybrid method and",
    "it's going",
    "i would say very well we wipe our desks",
    "down",
    "after each class and then",
    "when the next course comes in they would",
    "wipe the desk down again to ensure that",
    "it was",
    "cleaned properly so we're taking all the",
    "necessary steps to be able to have that",
    "traditional educational",
    "experience as well so javi uh",
    "college experience uh you know part of",
    "the experience of",
    "college is socialization meeting new",
    "people",
    "going to parties going to bars doing all",
    "kinds of",
    "things so so how how do you balance",
    "that uh can't that can't that can't be",
    "easy",
    "you've got the the threat of spread of",
    "the",
    "the virus just on campus just like you",
    "do anyplace else",
    "how how do you balance that",
    "i think it comes down to discontinuation",
    "of programming",
    "um that the institution can put on um so",
    "i know",
    "last evening we did an alpha art",
    "activity where you could go",
    "and create your name um with different",
    "types of letters that",
    "that were pictures that were taken um",
    "just",
    "from a lot of different locations um so",
    "being able to be involved within",
    "specifically",
    "on campus because we can guarantee as an",
    "institution that this on-campus",
    "experience is going to be safe",
    "right and so how can we",
    "ensure that the safety is going to",
    "happen off campus and really it comes",
    "down to",
    "you as an individual as how can you do",
    "your part to maintain",
    "the safety of your peers and individuals",
    "around you",
    "and so we have implemented a falcon",
    "commitment",
    "um we have provided options if you",
    "didn't feel safe",
    "to attend campus you could have taken",
    "your classes completely online",
    "undone it from a remote location whether",
    "it's at home or or",
    "simply from your apartment bedroom",
    "however",
    "um for those who decided to come in",
    "person and have that",
    "close to a traditional experience we've",
    "had these really expectations set in",
    "place",
    "that we continue to push forward to",
    "make sure you're doing your part to help",
    "us get these 13 weeks",
    "together hobby thank you very much i",
    "forgot to say your community",
    "communication major right",
    "i am good you're doing a good good job",
    "communicating today",
    "thank you we appreciate it and good luck",
    "to you and the other students at bowling",
    "green",
    "appreciate it very very much return now",
    "to",
    "ohio state um with us",
    "is anand shaw originally from",
    "centerville",
    "and majoring in biomedical research",
    "thanks for joining us we appreciate it",
    "thanks for having me governor dewine",
    "how's how's how's the experience this",
    "year",
    "the experience has definitely been",
    "something different um but i think it's",
    "been exciting",
    "to return i mean every year it's",
    "exciting to come back to campus i think",
    "this year it's been exciting",
    "uh for definitely a couple of different",
    "reasons i think being able to walk",
    "around campus you get to see the way",
    "that students are responding",
    "uh to the pandemic and i think there's a",
    "level of perseverance hope and optimism",
    "about",
    "the ability for us to work together to",
    "be able to take our campus and",
    "to be able to stay on campus i mean when",
    "it comes to",
    "what i thought when i was going to come",
    "back it was are students actually going",
    "to wear masks their students actually",
    "going to stay socially distant are",
    "students going to be within their",
    "parties of less than 10.",
    "and i think it's been interesting to see",
    "that in a time in an interesting paradox",
    "where",
    "in a time when we're supposed to be you",
    "know physically distant and apart",
    "i think the campus has come more",
    "together than i've ever seen",
    "and so that comes not only when you look",
    "at people on the oval who are sitting",
    "you know in their independent circles",
    "six feet apart or when you see people",
    "working out in the r pack",
    "which is a recreational facility and",
    "they're working and working out in a",
    "physically distance",
    "environment and even when you just walk",
    "around campus i think there's 30 000",
    "kids that are walking around",
    "our campus every day and it would be",
    "it's",
    "amazing to be able to see the amount of",
    "kids that have their masks on everybody",
    "um walking physically distant on making",
    "sure to stay safe so it's",
    "it's been a very exciting time i would",
    "say i have a lot of hope and um",
    "i've really seen that we've really come",
    "together as buckeyes",
    "um and we've i think we found our why is",
    "really just trying to",
    "make sure we can have our opportunity to",
    "stay here as long as possible",
    "so ohio state's doing a lot of testing a",
    "significant amount of testing",
    "uh they're putting it up on on on a web",
    "page",
    "from the time you've been back on campus",
    "how long",
    "i'm back on campus for about uh this is",
    "my second week so we've been back on",
    "campus for about",
    "about four days so yeah so any",
    "difference between uh",
    "when you came on campus the first day uh",
    "and now means is more people were in",
    "mass",
    "same any kind of difference in attitude",
    "as you talk to",
    "talk to students yeah absolutely i mean",
    "i think there's a greater understanding",
    "day by day there's a greater and greater",
    "recognition",
    "that the ability for our campus to stay",
    "open and the ability for our campus to",
    "stay healthy is really the hands of the",
    "students that are here i mean we make up",
    "the largest population of anybody who's",
    "on our campus and it really comes down",
    "to",
    "making sure that we can follow those",
    "rules stay with the guidelines and i",
    "think an attitude has definitely changed",
    "i think coming back to campus",
    "there was an understanding that you know",
    "mask wearing is a thing and that we need",
    "to",
    "have well fewer than 10 gatherings but i",
    "think with help from the university help",
    "with student leadership",
    "we've been really able to you know have",
    "those beliefs widespread and i think",
    "the amount of mass wearing has",
    "definitely increased i think people",
    "understand that",
    "with some of the numbers as you had",
    "mentioned earlier that the rate in ohio",
    "the pandemic is an ongoing thing and",
    "it's something that isn't",
    "going away anytime soon and i think",
    "that's something that students are",
    "really starting to recognize as",
    "they have a very tangible piece of the",
    "puzzle",
    "um and without them and without being",
    "able to follow those guidelines it's not",
    "going to be",
    "something where we'll be able to you",
    "know enjoy senior year freshman year et",
    "cetera so",
    "absolutely so ownership maybe of kind of",
    "the",
    "the destiny you see that absolutely",
    "absolutely i would say that",
    "students have really taken it um from",
    "the horns and i think that stands kind",
    "of",
    "how nicholas was saying where we",
    "have student organizations all across",
    "campus who have really started to buy in",
    "and have bought in from day one",
    "um to be able to make sure that the",
    "causes that we've had across campus",
    "kind of all come back to making sure",
    "that we stay together as buckeyes",
    "um to be able to make sure that every",
    "student organization",
    "uh can continue to run all students have",
    "the ability to then still participate",
    "and i think it comes down to programming",
    "as well i mean when we look at things",
    "like buck i thought an organization",
    "who's raising money for pediatric cancer",
    "typically an in-person event every",
    "single year i think",
    "you've seen organizations like that",
    "transform an entire dance marathon to",
    "being completely online",
    "and recognizing that we can still have",
    "the exact same impact",
    "um where we can transform and innovate",
    "uh in a greater sense",
    "across our campus and i think that not",
    "only for buck i thought but across all",
    "student organizations we've seen",
    "a very very uh pivotal shift but one",
    "that i think is",
    "utilizing innovation to make the best",
    "out of the situation",
    "i mean not only that making innovative",
    "moves where i think even",
    "outside of the pandemic will be",
    "beneficial for students",
    "thanks for joining us good luck to",
    "everybody at ohio state",
    "and thank you we appreciate it very much",
    "we'll go now to",
    "lieutenant governor",
    "good afternoon governor uh i have",
    "four items today three of them are on",
    "broadband and one of them is a",
    "public service announcement that we'll",
    "go over",
    "i want to take folks back to the",
    "broadband connectivity grant that we",
    "announced on july the 28th",
    "this was 50 million dollars of cares act",
    "funding",
    "that we were making available to schools",
    "and their students",
    "to supply or meet the urgent need that",
    "they had for high-speed internet so they",
    "could continue their education",
    "during the pandemic today we are making",
    "the awards of those grants we'll be",
    "informing",
    "951 schools school facilities",
    "of that their grant requests uh have",
    "been",
    "approved and this will go towards hot",
    "spots and internet",
    "internet enabled devices for broadband",
    "connectivity",
    "we had 83 million dollars in requests",
    "for the 50 million dollars that we had",
    "and so the way we handled this is that",
    "for the smaller requests under twenty",
    "thousand dollars uh they will get the",
    "entire",
    "uh requested amount for those who",
    "qualify",
    "and for schools that went above the",
    "twenty thousand dollars uh they will get",
    "the entire",
    "twenty thousand first first twenty",
    "thousand and then above that they will",
    "get",
    "uh 60 percent of",
    "their requested amount for qualifying",
    "purchases and this will enable there's",
    "the good news",
    "bottom line this will enable 121 000",
    "students to gain",
    "access to high-speed internet in their",
    "homes uh",
    "and thanks to the devices that will be",
    "provided with this grant",
    "so that's uh super important",
    "additionally uh there are areas where",
    "there are barriers to take-home devices",
    "the grant will also",
    "support the creation of new public wi-fi",
    "and mobile wi-fi spaces to help students",
    "connect to the internet",
    "and this will enable up to 645 000",
    "students",
    "in schools that are increasingly either",
    "increasing their public wi-fi",
    "or mobile use wi-fi these students will",
    "have places to go",
    "the bottom line is to connect to the",
    "internet if they don't have access",
    "to it in their homes and by the end of",
    "the week all the schools will receive",
    "the notifications of this",
    "and they can begin to purchase the items",
    "that they need",
    "so good news uh for",
    "you know hundreds of thousands of",
    "students who needed improved access to",
    "the internet",
    "we're getting that out to them this week",
    "another broadband if you if you go back",
    "to the telehealth pilot project we",
    "actually announced this in march it was",
    "the",
    "i remember it distinctly because it was",
    "the first day that we had our",
    "first case of covid19 that we reported",
    "as you recall governor you and i",
    "announced this telehealth pilot project",
    "with the",
    "switzerland of ohio school district",
    "which is in monroe county",
    "i know both of us have been there it's a",
    "very rural part of the state down in",
    "southeast ohio",
    "switzerland of ohio was chosen because",
    "of that fast fact they were a very",
    "difficult",
    "use case for this and we believe that if",
    "we could",
    "improve the situation there we could",
    "provide a strong blueprint for other",
    "schools to use",
    "who may find themselves in a similar",
    "situation just to review",
    "switzerland of ohio is extremely rural",
    "covers district district covers all of",
    "monroe county",
    "has significant poverty issues and had",
    "serious",
    "cases of mental illness mental health",
    "mental health issues i should say",
    "among students and their",
    "families in the last school year as",
    "promised",
    "this project has yielded a lot of really",
    "important lessons",
    "that we hope will will help other school",
    "districts a couple of those lessons",
    "first of all",
    "we now understand the regulation the",
    "regulation",
    "restrictions and complications that can",
    "come particularly regarding hipaa rules",
    "so we have been able to work through",
    "those",
    "we understand better the facilities and",
    "infrastructure is neat",
    "excuse me needed to provide private",
    "telehealth services to students",
    "we understand the staff resources that",
    "are necessary particularly on the",
    "the i.t side and we understand how",
    "a school needs to what they can do to",
    "leverage a relationship with an area",
    "health care provider",
    "so the takeaway frankly for students",
    "teachers and school leaders if",
    "you think you could benefit from this",
    "telehealth program",
    "and we know a lot of schools can",
    "particularly",
    "for mental health services",
    "this pilot project will provide the",
    "blueprint",
    "blueprint for that and we continue to",
    "we'll continue to learn from it",
    "you can find the blueprint at",
    "innovate.ohio.gov forward slash",
    "broadband",
    "that's innovate.org",
    "forward slash broadband so any school",
    "district that wants to understand how",
    "they can do this",
    "the information's there and if that's",
    "not enough you just call",
    "my office and we will make sure we get",
    "you to the correct resources",
    "an additional broadband update this is",
    "with the",
    "csi the common sense initiative ai tool",
    "we announced not too long ago that we",
    "have acquired the licenses for an",
    "artificial intelligence tool to go",
    "through all of the ohio",
    "revised code and and administrative code",
    "to streamline it and this is this",
    "research idea came from the",
    "telecommunications industry itself",
    "because in many cases",
    "they find regulatory challenges and",
    "it's confusing to them sometimes on how",
    "they can expand broadband",
    "uh as regulated entities and",
    "the csi team took a big look at this",
    "they took a look using the new",
    "artificial intelligence tool",
    "they noticed that there were a lot of",
    "common definitions but this is an",

    "303 definitions in ohio on rules",
    "and statutes across 25 different",
    "agencies regulating broadband",
    "for example there are 16 definitions of",
    "public utility",
    "in ohio law across five different",

    "agencies to to help",
    "expand broadband across the state",
    "and this is one regulatory reform we can",

    "it literally would have taken a team of",
    "people a month uh",
    "in their subject areas to get this done",
    "the i the ai tool took it",
    "took it on in two days and now we're",

    "to work with us uh on getting this",
    "streamlined so it's just",

    "hb6 and former speaker of the house",
    "larry householder was there",
    "do you still support hb6 as law given",
    "everything surrounding it",
    "and what does it mean that he was on the",
    "floor today",
    "speaking about householder",
    "well i think i've been pretty clear",
    "that hb6 needs needs to be repealed",
    "we need to start over again and",
    "he needs to be replaced we've got jobs",
    "at stake we've also for the foreseeable",
    "future the vast",
    "vast vast majority of our non-carbon",
    "generating electricity is nuclear",
    "and so if we lose the nuclear we've lost",
    "most of most of that",
    "but we need to start over so we've got",
    "to repeal it",
    "legislature we're happy to work with the",
    "legislature to figure out you know",
    "what where we go from here but i think",
    "hb6 has been so tainted um",
    "by what came out uh and what was",
    "disclosed",
    "that it needs to be needs to be repealed",
    "as far as the speaker uh former speaker",
    "being on the floor he is still a member",
    "uh so he has a has a right to be there",
    "um you know that's his his call",
    "next question is from tom gallick at",
    "gangwar news service",
    "hi governor looks like you might be",
    "getting",
    "civil immunity legislation on your desk",
    "pretty soon and you've talked about the",
    "importance of your strong ohio plan",
    "i wondered what else would you like to",
    "see from the legislature in the coming",
    "weeks and months",
    "well we've got significant reform bill",
    "in regard to",
    "police a bill that begins to treat at",
    "least like the",
    "professional job that it really is",
    "which means it'll be a board um",
    "an oversight oversight board just like",
    "for a nurse just like for a doctor",
    "i think that's very important i think",
    "it's important to put in statute that",
    "when there is a",
    "police shooting that that needs to be",
    "for a police officer shoot someone",
    "that that investigation that always",
    "takes place",
    "but that investigation needs to be done",
    "outside that that particular police",
    "department",
    "i think that is that is appropriate so",
    "there's a lot of other things in this",
    "bill but it's it's it's a bill",
    "that really has been has been worked on",
    "by the fop uh from our police",
    "uh by local law enforcement by",
    "community members and it's the",
    "it's really the right thing to do and as",
    "we see continue to see",
    "you know cases across the country that",
    "draw a lot of attention and tragic",
    "tragic cases",
    "you know i think we need to remember",
    "that there is a bill in ohio",
    "and we can pass this bill won't solve",
    "every problem but i think it it will",
    "certainly",
    "deal with some problems uh and and",
    "you know there's no police officer i've",
    "ever found who didn't think",
    "it was a profession and we need to treat",
    "it",
    "that way and there's no police officer",
    "i've ever talked to going back to when i",
    "was a prosecuting attorney",
    "who didn't think that more training was",
    "better",
    "and so these are some of the things that",
    "this that this bill does and i would",
    "i would think the timing is certainly",
    "right and the legislature",
    "uh should take that that bill on and",
    "pass it",

    "uh when i filled the position originally",

    "acton she was the last member of the",
    "cabinet to be pit",
    "um and it was not that we didn't have",
    "other good candidates we did",
    "but i felt that the role was so",
    "essential obviously the role is even",
    "more essential today",
    "in in the in the pandemic so um",
    "we we have some leads we're talking to",
    "some people but nothing",
    "yet to announce um i'm uh",
    "impatient about this as i am about a lot",
    "of things so we we would like to get",
    "that",
    "individual on board but we're not we're",
    "not quite there",
    "yet as far as the issues that you talked",
    "about",
    "uh that where there is a as you",
    "described in a dispute",
    "um all due respect i'm not sure there's",
    "a lot of dispute",
    "uh amassed the jury as we used to say",
    "when i was a prosecutor the jury",
    "jurors reached a verdict um masked",
    "by every credible person in the medical",
    "field",
    "is saying that masks are are in fact",
    "important",
    "we can point to the date when we started",
    "mask at our urban areas in the state of",
    "ohio",
    "and you can go forward a week or two",
    "weeks and you started to see",
    "numbers change uh when the mass",
    "compliance went up um you know you see",
    "you see results and so we have we have",
    "seen that",
    "in our urban areas uh we we hope to see",
    "more of it in the in the rural we're",
    "seeing somewhat in the world",
    "seeing people being more compliant uh",
    "and we know that that will make a huge",
    "huge difference and so as long as you as",
    "you say as long as you don't have a",
    "vaccine",
    "you know the mask and the social",
    "distancing are absolutely",
    "you know the key things um that",
    "are important the other is sanitation",
    "wash your hands and the other is being",
    "outside i mean those are all variables",
    "and we know",
    "each one uh does in fact work as far as",
    "the number of deaths",
    "you know i saw i've seen stuff on the",
    "internet i saw",
    "what was what was put out out of",
    "washington",
    "all that really means is that when",
    "someone",
    "dies i think they had like six percent",
    "were",
    "only listed as a coronavirus the other",
    "ones had",
    "other causes on there look that should",
    "not surprise uh",
    "any of us uh the people have",
    "other medical problems uh and if they",
    "have another medical problem that",
    "problem will",
    "will get listed uh on on the death",
    "certificate",
    "so i don't think that's that shouldn't",
    "be a shock to anybody",
    "um you know we've known in ohio uh the",
    "older a person gets",
    "uh you know their",
    "possibilities of survival is still good",
    "even",
    "even at a high age but it goes down and",
    "we know it goes down and statistically",
    "we have seen that and we also know",
    "statistically that as people get older",
    "they pick up more",
    "other medical problems that's just a",
    "fact of",
    "of life and and so these numbers i don't",
    "think",
    "you know change anything uh as far as",
    "um what what we know about",
    "covert 19 and what we know about the",
    "desk",
    "next question is from jesse ballmert at",
    "the cincinnati enquirer",
    "hello governor my question is the",
    "cincinnati police chief",
    "wrote in a letter that there had been",
    "some unintended consequences",
    "from the early bar closure things like",
    "multiple shootings and assaults at",
    "unprecedented levels in the city of",
    "cincinnati so i guess would you respond",
    "to those concerns",
    "yeah i've talked to mayor cranley",
    "uh today about that i talked to mayor",
    "cranley about that",
    "uh last week uh as well and he expressed",
    "that",
    "to me so what the chief said in his",
    "letter to me was not a",
    "not a surprise um you know we value our",
    "close working relationships with local",
    "government they're the ones who are",
    "on the on the scene uh other mayors",
    "uh in ohio uh because i've specifically",
    "asked them",
    "mayor ginther mayor bailey",
    "for example have told me that they",
    "adamantly feel that the 10 o'clock",
    "shutoff of liquor is very important to",
    "their communities and to their cities",
    "so we are at this point consulting our",
    "lawyers",
    "to see you know is it possible to carve",
    "out cincinnati",
    "out of a out of a statewide order",
    "and and frankly our lawyers um",
    "the initial read they gave us was they",
    "were very skeptical if we legally could",
    "do that",
    "but uh they're gonna research it and uh",
    "you know we're gonna",
    "see what they what they come up with",
    "again we believe that overall in the",
    "state has worked well",
    "but we respect the mayor in cincinnati",
    "mayor cranley respect the chief",
    "they have described unintended",
    "consequences basically where people",
    "uh leave the bar and then uh you know",
    "because they can't drink there anymore",
    "and they go off to a park or someplace",
    "else and",
    "so we we understand that uh",
    "but i think clearly the majority of",
    "mayors in the state by far uh believe",
    "just the opposite",
    "uh and they believe that the ten o'clock",
    "has been has been very very helpful",
    "so we think statewide it has been",
    "helpful",
    "as well so we're going to see what we",
    "can do for cincinnati we can't promise",
    "anything again",
    "we've consulted the lawyers to see if",
    "there's something we can do here",
    "next question is from andy chow at ohio",
    "public radio and television",
    "andy hi governor i just wanted to ask",
    "about",
    "just your take on the latest lawsuit",
    "filed against the state",
    "uh now in federal court just going",
    "against the",
    "the different orders that that they say",
    "keep ohio shut down although we know",
    "that a lot of businesses are reopened do",
    "you have any take on the latest lawsuit",
    "no not re not really uh you know we've",
    "i've been sued many many times over this",
    "the health department's been sued many",
    "many times i mean i don't know how many",
    "um you know they've been in many",
    "different counties",
    "and going into federal court i suppose",
    "it's something that we would",
    "would have expected so no i don't i",
    "don't have any comment about it i mean",
    "we're doing what",
    "um you know we know uh will make a",
    "difference",
    "we know that this economy cannot move",
    "forward that people cannot have jobs",
    "unless we keep the virus down we've got",
    "to keep the virus down",
    "you know we've been i think very",
    "thoughtful about what we have done",
    "uh the state is basically open",
    "there are some restrictions there's",
    "restrictions we just talked about for",
    "example in regard to liquor",
    "we've tried to take cases for example",
    "and come up with a responsible way to",
    "approach them high school",
    "football high school other other sports",
    "cross country",
    "you know we know there's some danger to",
    "that and spread but we also know there's",
    "really good reasons why uh young people",
    "need to be able to",
    "participate and so we've we've come up",
    "with",
    "a compromise where we don't have any",
    "spectators other than",
    "families and we let the athletes play",
    "so you know we try to to work this thing",
    "out",
    "one of the things i think we sometimes",
    "forget is none of these decisions are",
    "made in a vacuum",
    "and that's true not only for the",
    "decisions i make as governor that's also",
    "true for",
    "individuals as ohio citizens 11.7",
    "million ohioans we're making decisions",
    "every day and none of those decisions",
    "could be made",
    "you know in in a vacuum uh we want to",

    "violating the health orders and i was",
    "just wondering if you had any",

    "what they do which is to go out and to",
    "you know make sure",
    "sure the laws are are being enforced",
    "next question is from jim oddi at whio",
    "in dayton governor what the level of",
    "detail will you be requiring",
    "for uh k-12 schools the reporting of",
    "coronavirus cases",
    "but still protecting privacy and then",
    "secondly who's who's going to be doing",
    "the contact tracing of these schools",
    "uh contact tracing you know is going to",
    "be done by at the county level",
    "um you know we are there to back the",
    "back them up we have contact tracers if",
    "a county needs it",
    "we have a number of counties where we",
    "have contact tracers who are assisting",
    "them",
    "uh really depends on the size of the of",
    "the outbreak but",
    "this is you know what we've encouraged",
    "and what we've seen is a very close",
    "working relationship between the local",
    "health department and the local school",
    "you know i kind of jokingly told the",
    "superintendents a few months ago i said",
    "you know if you don't know your health",
    "director you will",
    "uh you know get to get to know them very",
    "well and look i'm just very proud of",
    "what",
    "ohio superintendents and principals and",
    "teachers have done across the state very",
    "difficult circumstances",
    "they're doing something they really",
    "never had to do before some doing it",
    "remotely some doing it in person some",
    "doing hybrid",
    "but they've all worked out they've all",
    "looked at it and part of that",
    "preparation is working very closely with",
    "with their local the local health",
    "department uh",
    "jim second part of your first part of",
    "your question uh you know had to do",
    "what's",
    "what kind of specificity are we going to",
    "require look we've got to balance this",
    "uh what we the law does not allow",
    "you to give up information that clearly",
    "pinpoints",
    "medical information and clearly",
    "pinpoints who that particular person",
    "is um you know many times people will",
    "certainly know who that person is but",
    "that we have to be careful to follow",
    "uh the law in that area so um you know",
    "in all likelihood",
    "for example uh the information um",
    "you know first of all if you're a parent",
    "uh and you've got a child who's come in",
    "contact in school",
    "with someone who now the school knows",
    "has kova the school will",
    "inform you as that parent that's what i",
    "think as parents or grandparents we",
    "would all",
    "we would all expect second if you've got",
    "a child in the building",
    "in a building where someone has had",
    "coconut you know if they have not been",
    "in contact with your particular child",
    "then",
    "just you know you will be notified",
    "everybody who has a child in that",
    "in that building will be notified that",
    "in fact",
    "uh there's somebody in that building who",
    "had who had who had coveted",
    "uh and then and then third uh it's a",
    "bigger",
    "bigger picture uh you know these are",
    "going to be reported in all likelihood",
    "uh by by school district uh such and",
    "such a district every week has",
    "so many cases and that's in all likely",
    "we haven't got it",
    "totally worked out yet but that's in all",
    "likelihood the way it's going to work",
    "with those kind of three levels",
    "next question is from adrienne robbins",
    "at wcmh",
    "in columbus governor thank you for doing",
    "this",
    "um you talked about today's case numbers",
    "rising and possibly that being due to",
    "cases and testing on our college",
    "campuses",
    "are you looking at these cases through a",
    "different lens than our general case",
    "count",
    "like we have with nursing homes and",
    "prisons and have you thought about",
    "separating those cases",
    "out on the dashboard so that people can",
    "see how just how many cases are coming",
    "from our universities",
    "um i don't think that would be a good",
    "idea",
    "uh i i think that you know if you're",
    "talking about",
    "prisons then uh",
    "you know there's always a relevance to",
    "the community even with prisons because",
    "you have people",
    "from the community who are bringing it",
    "in and then people who who are going",
    "who work there who may be taking it out",
    "too so there's a relevance to the",
    "community",
    "but a prison is a static population not",
    "static they come in and out but it's",
    "because they're released but most of the",
    "people are there",
    "uh and not mingling into that into that",
    "community",
    "but when you talk about the college um",
    "you know students at miami university",
    "students at",
    "ou the students at ohio state bowling",
    "green kent state",
    "you know they're in those communities uh",
    "they're uptown",
    "uh you know they may work someplace",
    "there",
    "they many of them don't even live on",
    "campus they live",
    "out in the community so i think it would",
    "be a mistake um",
    "you know it's interesting i think you",
    "know we try to kind of figure out",
    "okay why why are our numbers up i mean",
    "we've seen",
    "our positivity numbers go up in the last",
    "eight nine days",
    "we don't like that why are they why are",
    "they going up",
    "why are the cases remaining high over",
    "1400 today",
    "you know that's not good we try to at",
    "least understand it and drill down and",
    "figure it",
    "out but even then",
    "it's not particularly easy you know you",
    "you basically",
    "could take the number put out by the",
    "school and then you could you know",
    "see those numbers are showing up in your",
    "numbers so you know",
    "that those are separate and anybody",
    "could do that i mean anybody",
    "picking up the paper and dayton can",
    "figure out what ud is doing ohio state",
    "they can",
    "figure out in columbus and uh you know",
    "on and on",
    "but to separate them would indicate",
    "they're not part of the community and i",
    "think that would be a mistake",
    "because they are part of the community",
    "next question is from jeff redick at",
    "wsyx in columbus",
    "thanks governor to piggyback on that",
    "question",
    "uh and with respect to anan shah spoke",
    "earlier it seemed to be a bit of a real",
    "picture um for ohio state university",
    "which",
    "at last report was nearing a six percent",
    "positivity rate",
    "uh and knowing that that's a source of",
    "cases in the community",
    "how long would it be before your",
    "administration is driven to act",
    "beyond what the university might do",
    "well we're certainly i had the",
    "opportunity to uh",
    "talk with a new president who",
    "um i think starts officially today um",
    "or yesterday a new president we talked a",
    "nice conversation over the weekend",
    "just about that frankly about you know",
    "the rise in positivity",
    "if i remember correctly when the",
    "students came back",
    "it was about six tenths of one percent",
    "so a little bit a little above one half",
    "of one percent positivity",
    "just as they were coming in uh we've",
    "seen that number go up",
    "um and as you see that number go up it's",
    "you know just like we see any numbers go",
    "up that's not good",
    "so if that positivity number keeps going",
    "up obviously something's going to have",
    "to be done",
    "but you know the college presidents",
    "are very much on top of this i can tell",
    "you ohio state says",
    "ud's is miami's is bowling green i could",
    "go through",
    "because i've been talking to a lot of",
    "them and they're all over this",
    "so i'm not sure it's going to be my",
    "decision it's probably initially",
    "probably going to be a decision made by",
    "that school",
    "but let's let's you know let's hope uh",
    "let's hope that",
    "um students at ohio state students at",
    "every other university in the state or",
    "college in the state",
    "uh recognize that their ability to stay",
    "on campus their ability to stay in class",
    "is solely",
    "within collectively within their own",
    "hands",
    "they really control that and the school",
    "can do everything that it can do",
    "again just like our k-12 schools our",
    "colleges and universities i've spent a",
    "significant amount of money",
    "and time um you know i have every",
    "confidence that these kids are as safe",
    "as they could be",
    "or adults in class uh",
    "in the library uh even in usually in a",
    "dorm uh",
    "but it is what students do other times",
    "and uh you know it's what they do that",
    "can simply can't be controlled by the",
    "by the university and uh you know we all",
    "remember when we were that age and",
    "what we did and you know people like to",
    "party they like to get together that's",
    "part of the college",
    "experience but doing it with a mask",
    "is just vitally important today doing it",
    "with social distancing is vitally",
    "important doing it outside",
    "if you can do it outside you know so",
    "much safer",
    "outside and again i would say to our",
    "k-12 anytime you can have those kids",
    "outside",
    "uh where you think it's safe outside",
    "it's not a storm or something",
    "you know if you can get them outside",
    "that is going to be a safer environment",
    "than inside",
    "just by definition and we've learned",
    "that",
    "so very very much in the last in the",
    "last few months so",
    "these college presidents are on this",
    "they're focused on it",
    "uh they're watching the numbers and",
    "they're doing what what they can",
    "governor your next question is your last",
    "question and it belongs to",
    "max philby of the columbus dispatch",
    "hey governor um given your concern about",
    "labor day weekend and the fact that",
    "cases rose over july 4th weekend",
    "and also the fact that we've got a",
    "number of holidays coming up toward the",
    "end of the year this year that are on",
    "fridays saturdays that'll give us some",
    "long weekends",
    "have you given any thought to",
    "implementing any sort of coveted",
    "restrictions",
    "limited limited to holiday weekends and",
    "why or why not",
    "max i thought about a lot of different",
    "things and frankly i continue to think",
    "about you know what else can we do uh",
    "what else can we do and we're seeing the",
    "positivity go up",
    "uh what else can we do we know colleges",
    "are coming back they're in",
    "there's a lot of mixing just naturally",
    "the same thing with k k-12",
    "so yeah i think about things a lot i've",
    "not made any decision to do that but",
    "i've certainly thought about it",
    "eric is telling me that we are done i",
    "guess that's the last question",
    "we will barring something unforeseen we",
    "will see you all here",
    "two o'clock on thursday thank you very",
    "much",
    "you"
