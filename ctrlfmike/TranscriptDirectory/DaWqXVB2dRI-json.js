    "and dark county number three so we start",
    "off with three relatively small counties",
    "or more rural counties",
    "uh that have the highest amount of of",
    "cases per population",
    "for the last 14 days we then go to lucas",
    "then we go another smaller county not in",
    "geography but in the population",
    "that's lawrence county then in central",
    "ohio",
    "perry county again another smaller",
    "county fairfield kind of a mid-sized",
    "county",
    "and then franklin and then clear over in",
    "the eastern side of the state columbiana",
    "and then seneca seneca county",

    "but one of the things they they talked",
    "about was flea markets not just in",
    "columbiana county and seneca county but",
    "in other",
    "other counties in addition",
    "we've seen some incidents in regard to",
    "seneca county with weddings",

    "eric let's go now to a chart uh and this",
    "goes directly to",
    "some of the things that we've been uh",
    "we're going to talk about today and this",
    "is",
    "this is young people and we've shown",
    "this chart before this is kind of",
    "kind of an update in in the chart let me",
    "get it out here",
    "um this is percentage of cases by age",
    "group",
    "and if you look at the age group of 0 to",
    "19",
    "if you go back to march it was only 2.4",
    "percent of our total cases",
    "today it's almost 13 of our total cases",
    "our people",
    "young people 0 to 19. if you go the next",
    "level down age 20 to 29 in march it was",
    "12 percent",
    "and now it is about 19.4 percent",
    "a little bit less than it was in july",
    "and what it was in",
    "in june so just it's kind of interesting",
    "to see",
    "uh see that that breakout",
    "uh eric let's go to again the map okay",
    "this is our map again and let's",
    "flip beyond that eric and we'll go to",
    "a map that was done education model",
    "map this is done by the state department",
    "of education",
    "and it as of august 6. so some of you",
    "may have seen this",
    "uh i know the dayton daily carried it",
    "uh there may have been other papers that",
    "have carried this map",
    "as well but let me kind of go through",
    "this",
    "because this is",
    "i'd ask the department to prepare a map",
    "to kind of show us",
    "how many of our kids are going back to",
    "school",
    "in person how many school districts are",
    "going to start",
    "remotely and then how many are doing a",
    "hybrid",
    "so as you look at this let's start",
    "with what is kind of a light yellow",
    "at least on on my screen this is",
    "uh schools are planning when they start",
    "back",
    "in to go basically live",
    "uh with students in the schools",
    "um this is referred to as a five-day",
    "return simply meaning that kids are",
    "going to go back in school like",
    "pretty much as they normally would this",
    "is in-person instruction",
    "sometimes the schedules will be adjusted",
    "and of course the configuration of",
    "school may be",
    "adjusted but this is kids who will be",
    "there",
    "in in person so that's the light yellow",
    "the blue that's all remote",
    "those are students that are going all",
    "remote and you'll see",
    "a lot of our urban centers or",
    "or city schools or going uh remote",
    "online learning",
    "all students uh will receive only remote",
    "learning instruction",
    "which may be teacher-led or student-led",
    "but it will be remote at least",
    "at the beginning this is how they're",
    "going to start off",
    "green the green that you see there is a",
    "hybrid model a mix of in-person",
    "and remote learning education knowing",
    "that some grade levels may be",
    "all in in person or fully remote so it's",
    "a real mix",
    "there so again the yellow is in person",
    "that's how they intend to start uh the",
    "blue is they're intending to",
    "at least start uh online uh learning",
    "completely",
    "and the green is the hybrid or the",
    "combination of",
    "of those two um",
    "a couple things about this information",
    "and some qualifications",
    "to it this is what we know today",
    "actually back",
    "a few days ago on august 6. it is public",
    "schools only",
    "so we don't have there",
    "the parochial schools or any kind of",
    "private schools",
    "it only captures traditional public",
    "school districts and it does not capture",
    "all the subtleties of our hybrid models",
    "where different grade levels may be",
    "going in per",
    "person or in fact maybe going remote",
    "so based on what we know now",
    "we have 325 school districts",
    "in the state who are planning to return",
    "full-time",
    "that represents about 590 000 public",
    "school students or",
    "38 percent roughly these are all rough",
    "figures but approximately 38 percent",
    "of students would be going back to",
    "school",
    "uh in in person",
    "we have 55 districts for about 25.6",
    "percent",
    "or 398 000 students",
    "uh that will be fully remote so again",
    "that's 55 districts 25.6 percent",
    "uh of the of the school population will",
    "be going at least starting off",
    "online we have 154 districts",
    "or 24.5 percent",
    "which is approximately 380 000 students",
    "will be doing some for",
    "some form of hybrid schooling there are",
    "78 districts uh for which a few days ago",
    "we did not have the data",
    "on and so some school districts are",
    "still deciding",
    "uh and in some cases maybe we just don't",
    "have that in",
    "information so that kind of gives you a",
    "uh an idea",
    "uh gives me an idea of kind of what is",
    "happening",
    "as schools are making individual choices",
    "and of course as parents are making",
    "individual choices",
    "let me just talk for a moment before we",
    "get to our three doctors",
    "i'm anxious to to hear what they have to",
    "say",
    "but as we",
    "look at our schools",
    "and i've talked to a lot of",
    "superintendents i've talked to a lot of",
    "teachers",
    "um and let me just say uh i think our",
    "schools are doing a very good job",
    "uh getting ready uh those that are going",
    "to be online or those that are going to",
    "be in person i think they're doing a",
    "good job they've been working",
    "very very hard for those who",
    "are going to start either hybrid or",
    "totally in person i think",
    "they're going to do a very very good job",
    "look",
    "our teachers our principals",
    "folks that just work in this school",
    "that's in the cafeteria or wherever it",
    "is",
    "every day they work hard when there's no",
    "covet",
    "to protect our kids i've known a lot of",
    "teachers",
    "over the years related to some",
    "and they do a phenomenal phenomenal job",
    "and so i have every confidence",
    "that they're going to do everything that",
    "they can and have taken every precaution",
    "they can",
    "to keep your children or your",
    "grandchildren safe when they go back",
    "to school one thing i pointed out",
    "as i had some discussions this past week",
    "with school superintendents",
    "and i've said to them i have i'm totally",
    "confident",
    "that you're going to do a great job",
    "you've been focusing on this you've been",
    "getting ready for this",
    "but whatever is going on",
    "in the community will be reflected in",
    "your school",
    "you know if it's high coveted spread",
    "throughout the community it's going to",
    "be high",
    "in your school and there's there's",
    "really no way",
    "of changing that so no matter how good",
    "the schools are",
    "they basically get kids coming out of a",
    "community that may be",
    "high and so my plea today to",
    "parents and grandparents and if you",
    "don't have a kid in school",
    "if we want our kids to go to school we",
    "want them to be there in person if we",
    "want them to play sports if we want them",
    "to be",
    "in whatever club they're in whatever",
    "their passion is",
    "and there's nothing better than having",
    "your child cared",
    "a lot about something that might be",
    "sports it might be drama it might be",
    "banned it might be art if you want them",
    "to be able to have that experience then",
    "it's incumbent upon all of us every",
    "single one of us",
    "to do everything we can to keep down the",
    "spread in the community in which that",
    "school lives",
    "and that's the best thing that we can do",
    "the most important thing we can do to",
    "keep our kids in school for those kids",
    "who are going to",
    "start in school and to keep them in",
    "school",
    "and keep them able to go what we do is",
    "going to really frankly determine that",
    "what that community does what we do in",
    "our community and for kids who are",
    "starting online but the",
    "school is looking forward and saying hey",
    "you know maybe after a while we'll be in",
    "a position where",
    "we think we can have kids in school",
    "again what we do in that community is",
    "going to determine whether that",
    "opportunity is there for our kids and",
    "our grandkids and our",
    "our neighbors kids so we all think that",
    "being",
    "in school in person is important",
    "and the way to ensure that is for us to",
    "wear a mask when we're out",
    "keep our social distance not go to mass",
    "gatherings of people or large",
    "gatherings of people and just be careful",
    "stop the spread of it",
    "slow it down um it's really exactly what",
    "we need to do and that's the best thing",
    "that we can do",
    "uh if we have a real passion for having",
    "our kids in school and a passion for",
    "having our kids",
    "whether it plays sports or or engage in",
    "art whatever the kid likes to do",
    "young people like to do so",
    "that is kind of where we are at this",
    "point let me now go",
    "and i'm really happy to welcome dr john",
    "bernard who is the chief of pediatrics",
    "at nationwide children's hospital and",
    "president",
    "of the research institute at nationwide",
    "children's",
    "doctor uh welcome thank you very very",
    "much for",
    "being with us and i know that i've been",
    "told that you've been leading a team of",
    "physicians and researchers",
    "across some of ohio's children's",
    "hospitals",
    "to analyze the prevalence of cova 19",
    "among children",
    "uh and i wonder if you could just maybe",
    "tell us",
    "uh some of the things that you have",
    "found and kind of what the status is of",
    "uh cover 19 among our young people in",
    "ohio today",
    "thank you governor dewine i am",
    "privileged to speak on behalf of",
    "ohio six children's hospitals which are",
    "are overseen by and",
    "work together under the auspices of the",
    "ohio children's hospital association",
    "for really many many years but certainly",
    "in the covet era",
    "we've been working much more closely",
    "together to share best practices and",
    "ideas and also to collate data",
    "so for the past few months we've shared",
    "our data with one another",
    "and i'll review some of those learnings",
    "with uh with",
    "uh with you today great so first off a",
    "few high-level",
    "comments children get coronavirus",
    "infection let's",
    "let's be really crystal uh clear they",
    "get coronavirus infection and they get",
    "it not infrequently",
    "fortunately most children",
    "are reasonably well with their symptoms",
    "of",
    "of covid19 we know that about 90",
    "of them do really exceedingly well",
    "however a smaller fraction",
    "10 or maybe a little bit less actually",
    "get sick",
    "and need to be in the hospital and",
    "children with certain medical conditions",
    "actually can become critically ill and",
    "have been hospitalized in our",
    "ohio children's hospitals and in our",
    "intensive",
    "care unit so small number get really",
    "sick",
    "most kids do well we're very grateful",
    "for that but just to",
    "make sure folks know it can be a very",
    "serious",
    "disease in certain children now in ohio",
    "children's",
    "hospitals we're privileged to have six",
    "of the country's best",
    "here in ohio we took a different cut at",
    "the",
    "data and we were really interested in",
    "knowing",
    "uh what fraction of children what",
    "percentage of children who have symptoms",
    "that are compatible with covid",
    "actually tests positive so we've done",
    "over the course of the past five-ish",
    "months",
    "we've done about 14 000 tests",
    "for covid in children that have symptoms",
    "that suggest to our physicians that",
    "may be compatible with covid and we",
    "found 8.6",
    "positivity we're also",
    "interested in the test positivity in",
    "children that don't have",
    "signs or symptoms of covid and we're not",
    "out surveying in the community so how",
    "can we get a",
    "best estimate of that well we are most",
    "of us are testing all the children",
    "admitted to our hospitals",
    "whether they have coveted life symptoms",
    "or not and we're also testing children",
    "that are going to",
    "undergo surgery uh in the near future",
    "that's an outpatient elective surgery",
    "so that's as close as we can come to a",
    "to a asymptomatic",
    "population which has been talked about",
    "very frequently in the",
    "late press and also in the medical",
    "journals and since",
    "mid-march when we first started testing",
    "we've done about 20 000",
    "tests and these asymptomatic children",
    "and we find that a positive rate from",
    "the beginning of about 1.4",
    "now i would like to point out that that",
    "number has been rising in the past",
    "a month or so and as as uh now at about",
    "2.9",
    "if you just look back for the the prior",
    "week",
    "so we do think that there's some",
    "increase in the number of children that",
    "are asymptomatic",
    "but test positive from for covid",
    "and by the way i do want to say that the",
    "information that i'm giving you today",
    "is in children that are basically",
    "less than 18 years of age",
    "we have also broken down our data by age",
    "we're very interested in",
    "in um the spread from age zero to",
    "to age 18 and we have found that",
    "that older teenagers or really young",
    "adults at the age of",
    "17 are the highest prevalence of test",
    "positivity amongst",
    "all the children that we all the",
    "children that we",
    "test and we believe that's because 17",
    "year olds are now dolphin driving",
    "and they are socially much more",
    "active and tend to test positive",
    "statistically significantly",
    "more than younger children now let me",
    "talk a little bit more about",
    "the severity of the disease so",
    "of all the children that we've",
    "encountered that have been",
    "a positive across the state eight",
    "percent have",
    "required admissions admission to one of",
    "our children's",
    "hospital and of those eight percent",
    "one percent have had to go into our",
    "intensive care unit and some",
    "have been really critically ill and on",
    "ventilator",
    "so again it can be a very serious",
    "disease in children and some of these",
    "cases",
    "occur in children with underlying",
    "medical conditions such as",
    "obesity and type 2 diabetes type 1",
    "diabetes for",
    "example the last thing i would like to",
    "say",
    "just about the types of children that",
    "are getting coveted in our",
    "in our state is that we have learned",
    "that the prevalence of test",
    "positivity is four to six times",
    "higher in children from underrepresented",
    "minority",
    "groups specifically hispanic children",
    "and black children that's an observation",
    "that's really played out across the",
    "united states and it certainly seems to",
    "be",
    "playing out here in ohio and regardless",
    "of the",
    "of the um cities in which our children's",
    "hospitals are",
    "are located so finally",
    "i think many of us have heard about this",
    "multi-system inflammatory",
    "syndrome of children and interestingly",
    "here in ohio we've",
    "had 13 cases that we've identified at",
    "our children's hospital",
    "and far far fewer than some of the hot",
    "spots across the country like new york",
    "miami and others so i think we're",
    "fortunate in that regard in fact some of",
    "our hospitals have not even",
    "even seen the case and i just will",
    "report today",
    "happily that as of this morning at about",
    "seven o'clock none of our children's",
    "hospitals",
    "had children in their intensive care",
    "units being cared for",
    "with covered so a good report for today",
    "at least",
    "well doctor thank you that's a very",
    "thorough and uh",
    "i appreciate it i hope you can uh",
    "stay with us as we may have some",
    "questions uh from",
    "from the news media certainly i'd like",
    "to go i appreciate that very very much",
    "great",
    "great overview of what we're seeing in",
    "ohio what you're seeing in ohio and what",
    "all our children's hospitals are",
    "seeing and um i agree with you we are",
    "blessed with some amazing children's",
    "hospitals in ohio",
    "uh it's just a a great great thing for",
    "for our families let me now welcome",
    "dr pat patty manning dr manning is the",
    "chief of staff",
    "and developmental pediatrician at",
    "cincinnati children's hospital",
    "uh dr manny thank you very very much for",
    "being with us",
    "one if you could tell us maybe",
    "start off with what is",
    "the research telling us about kids being",
    "able to spread the virus",
    "sure thank you governor it's a a",
    "privilege to be able to speak on behalf",
    "of such an important topic on behalf of",
    "the ohio children's hospital association",
    "you know we're really just learning uh",
    "what children do in terms of spread but",
    "i think it's important to restate what",
    "you've already said and what dr barnard",
    "said and that is that",
    "children do get covered they are not",
    "immune from covet and when you have",
    "covid you can spread coping",
    "there's some very early research that",
    "suggests that the type of spread may",
    "differ by the age of child",
    "but it's a preliminary and it's hard to",
    "really um",
    "extend that research beyond just some",
    "initial thoughts about",
    "who might be more contagious i think",
    "it's safe to say that if a child has",
    "covet",
    "they'll they can be contagious whether",
    "they're symptomatic or not",
    "and as we have more time we'll learn",
    "more about what types of children",
    "spread who spreads more it's fair to say",
    "that younger children who need",
    "closer contact in their care might be at",
    "more risk of spread",
    "and so that the younger you are the more",
    "likely you may be to spread because your",
    "care has to be in more close contact",
    "with that but that comes about because",
    "of the",
    "length of time with that child and maybe",
    "also because the closeness with that",
    "child and those are two factors that are",
    "important that's very important a very",
    "good point that",
    "you know we talk a lot about close",
    "contact and what close contact means",
    "uh with regards to transmission so close",
    "contact to remind everyone is under six",
    "feet",
    "for more than 10 or 15 minutes and so as",
    "you're",
    "obviously aware most young children need",
    "close care you have to hold them or you",
    "have to feed them",
    "and you're going to do that for longer",
    "than 10 or 15 minutes",
    "but if you can be distant from older",
    "children more than",
    "three four five six feet and and you can",
    "do that for",
    "uh or when you are close it's under 10",
    "minutes you're at less risk",
    "and then and then doctor you may have",
    "covered this but what about kids over",
    "over 10 the older the teenagers maybe",
    "early teens so the older children and",
    "the teens as we heard a little bit",
    "already especially the teens and the",
    "mobile teams are",
    "a great risk for spread because they're",
    "very active and they're in close contact",
    "with each other",
    "you don't have a lot of evidence that",
    "says that they spread more or they",
    "spread differently but again that's",
    "another area of important study that",
    "we're waiting on",
    "i wonder if you can talk you know",
    "the reason we're doing this today doctor",
    "is as people are getting ready to send",
    "their kids back",
    "back to school and i wonder if you have",
    "based on",
    "your research your knowledge any kind of",
    "tips for",
    "students or parents uh administrators",
    "uh to keep schools safe and i know",
    "schools have been working very hard",
    "uh but we thought we would take this",
    "opportunity to",
    "have you talk directly to people of ohio",
    "and uh",
    "tell them what uh what you know based on",
    "your your uh",
    "your your uh studies and your expertise",
    "absolutely and i i just want to echo",
    "what you said about the hard work that's",
    "being done by all the school leaders and",
    "administrators they have",
    "such a huge lift and the exposure that",
    "i've had to the work that they've done",
    "has been",
    "uh it's been just impressive um what",
    "school leaders are doing to keep our",
    "kids safe",
    "uh and we recognize that opening a",
    "school is a local decision it's a",
    "community decision it's based on many",
    "local factors",
    "as pediatricians we do support and are",
    "biased in the direction of",
    "in person education when possible",
    "and for that education to be safe there",
    "are really",
    "four very specific strategies in order",
    "of importance that we want schools",
    "and families to be aware of the first is",
    "masking",
    "that everyone can wear a mask everyone",
    "should wear a mask it's recommended that",
    "children in k",
    "through 12 wear masks that will protect",
    "everyone teachers and students",
    "the second is distancing and so we talk",
    "a lot about the importance of distancing",
    "in six feet",
    "and six feet is optimal six feet is",
    "great but three feet is also good",
    "and four feet's a little bit better than",
    "three feet and five feet is better than",
    "four feet",
    "and so we know there's a continuum of",
    "safety uh that can be in place in",
    "schools we",
    "also all recognize how hard it may be to",
    "keep children six feet apart at all",
    "times",
    "so i've talked to many families and many",
    "teachers about doing your best",
    "recognizing that some distance is better",
    "than no distance and six feet is optimal",
    "but it's not always going to be",
    "achievable",
    "the third aspect of safe care and safe",
    "education",
    "is hand hygiene and so this is something",
    "we've all been hearing a lot about",
    "washing our hands using hand sanitizer",
    "this is something that should happen on",
    "a regular schedule in schools it should",
    "be made fun",
    "and kids can be engaged in this type of",
    "activity and be part of that",
    "and then the fourth most important",
    "factor is cleaning surfaces",
    "and sometimes we place a lot of emphasis",
    "on cleaning surfaces as if it's the most",
    "important factor and it's important",
    "but the good news is that covet is not",
    "very hardy",
    "it dies when it dries and it dies in the",
    "sunlight",
    "and so we don't need extensive",
    "over-the-top",
    "elaborate cleaning processes we need our",
    "usual routine cleaning processes we need",
    "to wipe down",
    "high touch surfaces and and we need to",
    "really focus on hand hygiene because if",
    "our hands are clean",
    "then we're all really protected another",
    "important factor",
    "is ventilation and there have been a",
    "number of studies that demonstrate that",
    "areas that are better ventilated",
    "uh have lower risk of disease",
    "transmission we know that schools vary",
    "in their ability to provide different",
    "degrees of ventilation",
    "but at any time that a teacher can open",
    "a window can take a class",
    "outside when it's appropriate at the",
    "discretion of the teacher",
    "those are activities that will help as",
    "well",
    "and those i think you said at the",
    "beginning",
    "those are cumulative do all of them is",
    "that the",
    "cumulative they're accumulative but",
    "they're in order of importance so the",
    "masking is the most important",
    "followed by distancing followed by hand",
    "hygiene followed by surface cleaning",
    "but together they create a very robust",
    "package for safety",
    "and i want to also echo what you said",
    "earlier and that is that",
    "um you know what we do in our community",
    "will impact our schools we are all",
    "connected",
    "we are all in this together and so what",
    "happens in our communities will impact",
    "our schools and what happens in our",
    "schools",
    "will be reflected in our community uh if",
    "we want children to do these things",
    "we want children to wear masks we have",
    "to wear masks we have to model that",
    "behavior for them as",
    "the adults and the parents in their",
    "lives uh and so it's really",
    "all for one in this type of uh climate",
    "that we're in",
    "doctor what if you could you know talk a",
    "little bit",
    "uh about uh kind of the stress i mean",
    "this has been a stressful time for",
    "adults stressful time",
    "for kids kids are going to be starting",
    "back in school",
    "some of the protocols that they're going",
    "to have to follow will be different",
    "some kids will be wearing masks maybe",
    "for the maybe for the first time",
    "um any advice for parents any advice for",
    "teachers as we",
    "we kind of start back in this uh great",
    "unknown or",
    "something at least different for us",
    "exactly one one piece of advice i've",
    "given a lot of families including just",
    "this morning when i was in clinic",
    "is to uh let children know that it's",
    "okay",
    "to be uncertain there's a lot of",
    "uncertainty we've been dealing with a",
    "tremendous amount of uncertainty",
    "and sometimes children look to us for",
    "recognition and approval of that",
    "uncertainty yes we know it's different",
    "we know that things have changed and",
    "that's okay",
    "but we're going to learn together as we",
    "go so parents talking to their children",
    "and giving them",
    "some some warning and some heads up",
    "about what may be coming",
    "doing a little bit of rehearsal around",
    "mask wearing about",
    "hand hygiene um we talk a lot in my",
    "field about using stories and social",
    "stories to kind of illustrate here's",
    "what's going to happen here's what it",
    "might look like",
    "most children and most people really",
    "benefit from structure so preparing",
    "children who may have not had a lot of",
    "structure over the past several months",
    "preparing them for the uh the restart of",
    "some structure of sleep schedules wake",
    "schedules",
    "i've i talked about that literally all",
    "morning with families about the",
    "importance of getting back onto a",
    "schedule",
    "and how much schedules and",
    "predictability help everybody",
    "uh and so i think there are a lot of",
    "basic things that families and teachers",
    "can do",
    "starting with just talking to children",
    "and trusting that they're actually going",
    "to understand and be able to comply",
    "dr manny thank you very much very very",
    "helpful i wonder if you could",
    "stay with us a little bit we may have",
    "some questions from the",
    "from the news media but thank you for",
    "those good good instructions and those",
    "those good tips we appreciate it very",
    "very much",
    "let me now welcome our third",
    "doctor dr adam misoff chief medical",
    "officer at dayton children's hospital",
    "uh doctor thank you very very much for",
    "being with us",
    "i know that you've been working with",
    "physicians at dayton children's to",
    "develop a protocol for how schools",
    "respond",
    "if and when covet appears in their",
    "schools",
    "so first of all thanks for joining us",
    "but i wonder if you could kind of",
    "maybe run through some examples of",
    "how schools should react",
    "kind of maybe a a drill so to speak",
    "you've got this circumstance and this",
    "circumstance and then how does how does",
    "the school",
    "react to that so thanks for joining us",
    "uh thank you governor it's a pleasure",
    "and i'd like to echo the comments of my",
    "colleagues they're very important",
    "that the best things we can do uh start",
    "at home",
    "in showing our kids uh how this how this",
    "can be and how predictable we can make",
    "it",
    "so i appreciate the question uh we have",
    "some slides that i'd like to show you",
    "uh we have been working uh closely with",
    "the school systems with the health",
    "department",
    "and with our primary care doctors to try",
    "and help develop",
    "a path forward if you will an",
    "evidence-based guide",
    "an algorithm a way for people to start",
    "thinking about how to manage",
    "these problems as they arise because we",
    "know that",
    "as school starts up there'll be a lot of",
    "questions a lot of concerns a lot of",
    "things that may change",
    "this slide is part of our algorithm and",
    "so my intention is not to walk through",
    "this",
    "in great detail but just to highlight a",
    "few things for you the first is if you",
    "look at the top left corner",
    "the box is where people start which is",
    "or have you been exposed to somebody",
    "with covet",
    "and if the answer is yes it goes across",
    "the screen",
    "and asks the question and patty referred",
    "to this",
    "that were you within six feet and there",
    "for longer than 15 minutes the cdc",
    "defines that",
    "as a significant exposure and if so",
    "we know the standard approach the",
    "protocols to this",
    "the challenge often comes with symptoms",
    "that aren't as",
    "clear so this algorithm if you will",
    "walks through what may be considered",
    "high-risk symptoms low-risk symptoms",
    "and one of the points i wanted to make",
    "was that",
    "not all the illnesses we will see this",
    "fall are coveted",
    "but having said that one of the messages",
    "we've given to our hospital staff and i",
    "would give to the schools is",
    "if you're sick stay home it doesn't have",
    "to be coveted",
    "so whether it's a staff person or a a",
    "a student if you have a fever and you're",
    "sick",
    "first and foremost please stay home that",
    "will help protect",
    "others in your school and other families",
    "so that will be part of this protocol so",
    "to address your question perhaps the",
    "next slide",
    "we've come up with go ahead sir i'm",
    "sorry doctor let me interrupt eric",
    "are the slides up okay they're up i'm",
    "not seeing them but",
    "they're up okay as long as the people",
    "who are watching this can see them okay",
    "go ahead i apologize yes sir um so we",
    "have more than a dozen scenarios and i",
    "have",
    "three that are incorporated in this uh",
    "sly deck",
    "and and this is to help folks sort of",
    "walk through and understand",
    "how this algorithm can help them and how",
    "they can approach",
    "uh students faculty and others as",
    "the fall evolves so in a scenario one a",
    "child's riding the school bus monday",
    "through friday",
    "not wearing an ask all the time but only",
    "on the bus for 10 minutes",
    "feels ill over the weekend and then",
    "comes up",
    "positive for covet and the two main",
    "concerns are",
    "who needs to be isolated and who perhaps",
    "needs to be evaluated",
    "and so if you go to the next slide with",
    "these scenarios that we're sending",
    "and sharing with the schools in our",
    "regions and we're going to",
    "talk as a group at ohio children's",
    "hospital we walk",
    "through how you would answer this so who",
    "is isolated",
    "bus driver no in this case the student",
    "was in the back of the bus and not near",
    "them",
    "and again foundationally because they",
    "are not within six feet for 15 minutes",
    "therefore they don't need to be isolated",
    "again if the students were around them",
    "for less than",
    "15 minutes and less and more than six",
    "feet",
    "then there is no need for isolation but",
    "i would point out that we assume when a",
    "family member is positive",
    "whether you have a positive test on",
    "other family members that we treat",
    "the whole family as if that's a",
    "significant exposure and they are",
    "positive",
    "and we know that testing can be a",
    "challenge so we're trying to be",
    "good stewards of that resource so who",
    "should be evaluated by a provider who",
    "may need testing",
    "again the second piece of the scenarios",
    "that we have constructed have to do with",
    "if you walk through each member of this",
    "scenario",
    "who needs what and in general if you",
    "have no symptoms",
    "and you didn't have a significant",
    "exposure then just",
    "watching and making sure you're okay is",
    "sufficient",
    "the next slide is a second scenario",
    "again this is now in the classroom it is",
    "closer to six feet",
    "the student developed symptoms and again",
    "i'll remind you that",
    "um within six feet and for more than 15",
    "minutes",
    "is considered a significant exposure",
    "different people",
    "will use different definitions of",
    "sufficient",
    "uh personal protective equipment but",
    "without getting off on that tangent if",
    "we go to the next slide",
    "we again answer those kinds of questions",
    "so who should be isolated yes",
    "classmates and teachers if they were",
    "again within that",
    "distance and for the time frame that",
    "we've described",
    "and in general without symptoms it's",
    "okay",
    "to watch but if there's any concern",
    "about the symptoms that are developing",
    "we are partnering with our primary care",
    "doctors to make sure that they have the",
    "information they need uh to help manage",
    "these patients",
    "so yes all of these folks would be",
    "isolated because they were",
    "in that 6 foot 15 minute mark",
    "and depending on their symptoms depends",
    "on who",
    "would move forward with more uh of a",
    "health care evaluation",
    "the final scenario we're going to talk a",
    "little bit again about what has",
    "come up before which is how does this",
    "work as far as sports are concerned",
    "uh once again there are basic tenants",
    "that we're going to the student",
    "participates in volleyball",
    "they have face coverings at the",
    "beginning at the end of practice",
    "but certainly not during practice if",
    "they're closer to six feet",
    "and that teammate does end up with",
    "symptoms",
    "and a test is positive how do you handle",
    "this",
    "so again the questions are who should be",
    "isolated",
    "and who may need further evaluation if",
    "you go to the next slide",
    "the the team that was close to this",
    "person",
    "would need to be evaluated since that",
    "test is positive another one of the",
    "take-home messages though",
    "is that if you are in contact",
    "with a contact of somebody red cove so",
    "it's a",
    "it's once removed that person does not",
    "count as somebody who has been actively",
    "exposed to the infection",
    "i'm happy to walk through the answers to",
    "this governor but in the interest of",
    "time",
    "i'm happy to turn it over to you and see",
    "if there's specific questions these were",
    "meant to be just though",
    "examples of the scenarios we're trying",
    "to construct",
    "to help people walk through an",
    "appropriate way of",
    "handling the problems that are going to",
    "arise as schools return",
    "doctor you want to comment a little bit",
    "and thank you that was very helpful",
    "about different scenarios based on",
    "whether you're outside",
    "or inside how much that impacts that",
    "and i think what may be a little",
    "confusing",
    "is a little bit to me whenever i hear it",
    "is because the the",
    "standard of how long you're with a",
    "person",
    "and how that how that plays out",
    "and what the other variables that might",
    "be",
    "you might look at to determine whether",
    "or not that person you",
    "you think there's a there's a problem",
    "connected to that person and sports is a",
    "sports is a great example",
    "you know contact sports uh you know",
    "whether whatever you call volleyball but",
    "uh you know if you're",
    "close to the net uh with somebody on the",
    "other side maybe you have some contact",
    "with them",
    "um so you wanna just go through the",
    "different variables",
    "yes sir i'm happy to um first and",
    "foremost",
    "and i know patty mentioned this when she",
    "talked about ventilation there's no",
    "greater ventilation than being outside",
    "so how how much breeze",
    "gets to pull droplets away from people",
    "anything we can do outside would be",
    "great and and patty is in the past",
    "talked about even if you can get a",
    "classroom outside",
    "that natural outside ventilation is",
    "always",
    "uh very helpful well",
    "you may have seen the picture i saw them",
    "i don't know a month or so ago there's",
    "some articles about the 1918",
    "1919 and they had classes actually",
    "outside",
    "in some places yes and i've been accused",
    "of being in some of those classrooms but",
    "i am not that",
    "in addition um part of the challenges",
    "is is is being able to determine",
    "um the contact level if you will and so",
    "we've had questions that arise about",
    "intermittent",
    "contact is it cumulative or consecutive",
    "is the contact for 15 straight minutes",
    "or if",
    "i'm in contact with somebody five",
    "minutes every hour",
    "five times and i must tell you there is",
    "no",
    "hard and fast evidence on the exact",
    "path to take so we again are trying to",
    "make a judgment",
    "based if you will on the intensity of",
    "the exposure",
    "and that's where one of the things that",
    "we're all working on",
    "is a hotline where people can call and",
    "we can help them sort through that",
    "uh when that arises so",
    "general principles but the science gets",
    "a little",
    "iffy if you're trying to compare for",
    "example if five five and five or",
    "15 straight yes sir and i'd be happy to",
    "have my other colleagues",
    "uh weigh in but my understanding and all",
    "that we've read is",
    "it's very hard to discern one versus the",
    "other",
    "okay good well doctor thank you very",
    "much if you could",
    "stay with us as well yes sir we're going",
    "to now go",
    "to lieutenant governor for some state",
    "comments and",
    "then we're going to go to questions and",
    "if we can hold the three doctors",
    "here in case there's some questions for",
    "them lieutenant governor",
    "thanks governor i was making some notes",
    "as the doctors were talking all three of",
    "them did",
    "a fantastic job of explaining",
    "the situation uh uh that they",
    "that they all uh the such the the",
    "different situations they were all",
    "describing i know that when i from the",
    "time i wake up in the morning",
    "uh to the time i go to bed at night i'm",
    "consuming information on these topics uh",
    "particularly a lot of that related to",
    "school",
    "and and i thought they all did a great",
    "job of explaining",
    "uh because we know that every family or",
    "every superintendent who's making a",
    "decision",
    "is is just struggling with getting all",
    "the health data",
    "right thinking about all of their",
    "academic options",
    "family circumstances we know how those",
    "things are difficult",
    "choices as it relates to work and health",
    "and mental health and",
    "and trying to make the the best choices",
    "for your children so",
    "all of this information that we get",
    "helps uh",
    "and it's important to remember that",
    "we're all consuming this during a very",
    "difficult time",
    "it's hard on the school officials and",
    "the teachers that are contemplating",
    "their future",
    "the families that are contemplating",
    "their particular futures i know we're",
    "all in a little bit different",
    "circumstances",
    "in in my case my wife and i are",
    "comfortable with our daughters uh headed",
    "back heading back to school",
    "this fall but we know that there are",
    "many families and many circumstances",
    "where that may not work out",
    "uh and may not be the best thing",
    "for those for those families and we know",
    "uh",
    "how was because we talked to them we",
    "talked to all the folks who are doing",
    "this the governor and i do and",
    "we know how people are struggling uh",
    "and you know that's why you know nobody",
    "knows how this is going to go",
    "nobody knows exactly if you're in school",
    "if you're not in school how this is",
    "going to work",
    "for the fall that's why i just want to",
    "remind people that the governor has",
    "given",
    "ohio a choice in this",
    "what he's asked is to say that the local",
    "schools are going to make the best",
    "decision based on their community",
    "standards families get to make the",
    "decisions",
    "based on their circumstances and i think",
    "we're going to learn",
    "a lot from that we will we will learn uh",
    "from that process which will inform",
    "next steps uh as schools families and",
    "parents continue to learn",
    "but i will say there is something that",
    "we do know",
    "we know how to slow the spread of the",
    "virus",
    "and whether you're in school or outside",
    "of school",
    "you do these things right and we'll make",
    "it more likely that all of this gets to",
    "happen in our futures because we will",
    "slow the spread of the virus",
    "and um as we as we often say",
    "back up mask up and wash up",
    "those are the things that work uh and if",
    "we do them",
    "we're gonna get a chance to to do more",
    "things because we will have slowed the",
    "spread so",
    "i really appreciate the doctor's uh",
    "advice there and council and",
    "and governor thanks for giving me a few",
    "minutes to to share",
    "share some thoughts and and i know that",
    "that families and schools alike are",
    "struggling with these decisions and so",
    "we all have to be",
    "we have to be patient and",
    "and and caring and understanding as we",
    "all work through this",
    "thank you very much we're ready for",
    "questions",
    "we still have the doctors if anyone has",
    "a question for",
    "one or all of the doctors or if you have",
    "a question for the lieutenant governor",
    "or for myself",
    "governor our first question today at",
    "wbns 10 tv in columbus",
    "hello governor can you hear me",
    "well we're getting a little echo there",
    "but i can't hear you yeah",
    "i think can you hear me yes",
    "okay great uh franklin county remains in",
    "the red and it's been there since the",
    "beginning of the health advisory",
    "what are you hearing at the as to why",
    "that is and if it stays in red do you",
    "think that will prevent",
    "high school football from happening and",
    "to the doctors",
    "how do you feel about children",
    "riding the school bus if you had",
    "children in school",
    "would you feel comfortable with them",
    "riding in a school bus",
    "to and from school considering the",
    "social distancing concerns",
    "doc doctors all start i'll do the",
    "franklin county one you guys can do the",
    "uh",
    "the the bus one",
    "look i mean i can only speculate uh a",
    "better person to ask that would be you",
    "know",
    "one of the health directors or medical",
    "doctor as far as franklin county",
    "uh mayor ginther and i have talked about",
    "this a lot",
    "uh and you know if you look at columbus",
    "itself",
    "uh it probably is the youngest uh",
    "community and franklin county probably",
    "is the youngest county as far as",
    "population",
    "i don't have the data but um it's it's",
    "it's a younger group of people",
    "uh and one of the things that we have",
    "seen uh is that particularly with 20 to",
    "29 year olds",
    "you know they're picking it up at a much",
    "heavier rate than they were",
    "and i think visually you can just see",
    "that they're out and about a lot",
    "that's understandable so the fact that",
    "franklin county has more",
    "young people is probably a great",
    "advantage for the county",
    "but it probably also is a reason that",
    "you're seeing the spread",
    "you know continue here in franklin",
    "county",
    "continued there in franklin county",
    "let me go to let me go to the doctors",
    "and we'll talk they can",
    "take the question about riding a school",
    "bus",
    "i think i'm gonna i'm gonna take the",
    "school bus questions so i i think it's",
    "always fair to say hey would you let",
    "your children do this",
    "and my answer to that question is yes i",
    "would i understand that bus riding feels",
    "different it feels more constrained it",
    "feels like children are in very close",
    "contact which they are",
    "but the good news is children are facing",
    "forward if they're behaving on the bus",
    "they're facing forward",
    "if they're wearing masks if they are not",
    "sick",
    "if they practice hygiene before and",
    "after being on the bus",
    "uh then i think children can ride the",
    "bus safely and i think that",
    "the bus you know riding the bus to",
    "school is the only way that some",
    "children get to school",
    "and i would hate to limit access to",
    "in-person school because of some kind of",
    "transportation constraint",
    "so i think we can make bus travel safe",
    "for children and i think um i think that",
    "i would support that yes",
    "okay any other doctors",
    "okay we'll go the next question next",
    "question",
    "is from jeff redick at wsyx in columbus",
    "hi governor thanks for running this",
    "again",
    "uh for the doctors i believe it was last",
    "week",
    "or a week and a half ago when the",
    "state's mass order was issued",
    "for uh schools and students k-12",
    "specifically",
    "it was mentioned that the ohio",
    "children's hospital association",
    "said that asthma allergies or sinus",
    "infections would not be considered",
    "exemptions from wearing a mask and i",
    "know those conditions specifically",
    "become touch points for parents with",
    "children who have asthma allergies sinus",
    "infections regularly",
    "why won't those get you out of wearing a",
    "mask if you're k through 12.",
    "and let me just jump in before they",
    "answer ultimately",
    "you know these determinations are going",
    "to be made by the principal they're",
    "going to be made by the by the teachers",
    "uh what the doctors offered and what the",
    "american pediatrics association the ohio",
    "chapter offered",
    "was the best medical advice they could",
    "give so let me turn it to the doctors",
    "for that",
    "governor i'd be happy to try and answer",
    "that and",
    "and what i can tell you is when that",
    "document was constructed",
    "we asked for help from a lot of experts",
    "and one of the groups we asked for help",
    "was",
    "was our pulmonologists and our",
    "pulmonologists are our lung doctors and",
    "those are the doctors that manage these",
    "patients",
    "and they were very clear that most",
    "patients with those disorders",
    "a mask would not interfere with their",
    "ability to breathe or their ability to",
    "function well",
    "and they felt that the importance of",
    "masks protecting those",
    "patients from getting an infection in",
    "their lungs far",
    "exceeded any risk that there was in",
    "wearing them so",
    "there was a lot of thought it's a very",
    "good question there was a lot of thought",
    "put into that",
    "but we actually reached out to experts",
    "who take care of these patients and they",
    "felt strongly that",
    "these kids needed the protection of a",
    "mask",
    "okay next question next",
    "question is from andy chow at ohio",
    "public radio and television",
    "hi governor thanks for having this press",
    "conference i wanted to talk about",
    "uh the definition of close contact being",
    "within six feet",
    "for longer than 10 to 15 minutes what",
    "we've seen in other states that",
    "a lot of controversy starts to pop up",
    "when pictures of crowded",
    "hallways start to circulate are crowded",
    "hallways",
    "dangerous at schools i'm going to refer",
    "to the doctors",
    "so who wants to take it",
    "i can take that question so um i'd say",
    "quickly yes",
    "crowded hallways are probably not",
    "optimal for a lot of reasons not just",
    "coven",
    "um it gets again back to the length of",
    "time in that hallway and so",
    "um if you remember back to your own high",
    "school days it was unusual",
    "to be traveling in a crowded hallway for",
    "more than 10 minutes",
    "uh so i think that's an an aspect of",
    "duration that we have to consider",
    "i mean ideally schedules would be",
    "staggered in a way so that kids weren't",
    "crammed up next to each other",
    "um so the short answer is yeah they're",
    "not optimal they're not great but they",
    "shouldn't be prohibitive to",
    "school uh participation and they should",
    "be managed we can manage those better",
    "and if i may say that a crowded hallway",
    "with the mask it's a different",
    "calculation than a crowded hallway",
    "without mass so back to dr manning's",
    "assertion earlier that mask or priority",
    "number",
    "are number one okay thank you very much",
    "next question next question is from",
    "scott hallis of the xenia daily gazette",
    "hey governor how you doing scott uh",
    "thanks for",
    "taking my question so the doctors have",
    "all said that",
    "you know being outside and having good",
    "ventilation is an important thing",
    "and that there's no way to kind of",
    "discern whether five minutes of contact",
    "three times is better or worse than you",
    "know 15 minutes",
    "at once the ohio high school football",
    "coaches association",
    "sent you a pretty comprehensive plan as",
    "far as how they plan to cleanse things",
    "and how they plan to try and keep things",
    "safe if there's a season",
    "so how much of this information the",
    "doctors have said today",
    "regarding you know ventilation",
    "everything is going to help sway your",
    "decision one way or another with regards",
    "to",
    "uh football this fall well i'll start",
    "off and i'm gonna refer to see if any of",
    "the doctors want to make any comment",
    "uh about that um you know scott",
    "these decisions are not made in a vacuum",
    "and by that i mean",
    "um it's not a question does the does",
    "that young person play football does",
    "that person play",
    "uh playing the band does that person do",
    "whatever they're doing",
    "part of the question is what do they do",
    "if they're not doing that",
    "um and so i think one of the arguments",
    "for sports",
    "uh is it does have a discipline to it",
    "uh and you know we're still working on",
    "the orders in regards to sports we'll",
    "have that shortly it won't be too much",
    "longer",
    "you know we've basically taken sports",
    "and",
    "let it play out during during the during",
    "the fall",
    "but the final decisions that will be",
    "coming very very shortly but",
    "part of the argument for sports",
    "that is i think a strong one is first of",
    "all there's a discipline to sports",
    "part of that discipline this year will",
    "have to be different than the normal",
    "discipline part of the discipline this",
    "year will have to be being safe",
    "and i think our coaches those who are",
    "assisting",
    "those who are working with our young",
    "people whether in sports or whether",
    "in drama or whatever they're in um",
    "they're they are role models and",
    "what's not only it's not only important",
    "what these",
    "young people do in school what they do",
    "in practice whatever that",
    "is they're practicing but what they do",
    "the other rest of the day",
    "and so our coaches our teachers have a",
    "great opportunity",
    "to help these young people understand",
    "that the choices they make at nine",
    "o'clock at night",
    "or 10 o'clock at night or some other",
    "time on the weekend when they're not",
    "practicing or they're not",
    "you know with the coach that those life",
    "choices",
    "that they're going to make this year",
    "they're always important but this year",
    "they're more important than they've ever",
    "been before",
    "and that the choices they make may",
    "determine whether or not their team is",
    "going to be able to continue to play",
    "that sport",
    "and so everybody literally on that team",
    "is in it together",
    "and if one gets sick maybe many will get",
    "sick and so",
    "staying away from situations where you",
    "may get sick",
    "or at least doing the best you can",
    "wearing that mask",
    "you know when you're out and keeping the",
    "social distance and doing the other",
    "things that",
    "that we we have been talking about here",
    "coaches have a great ability to",
    "get that message across in a way",
    "sometimes that",
    "even parents don't have a way of doing",
    "that so i'm going to turn it to the",
    "doctors and see what comments they have",
    "but that's my",
    "kind of some comments that i would have",
    "in regard to this whole",
    "whole decision that parents will make",
    "that schools will make",
    "and what kind of guidance that we're",
    "we're going to put out",
    "i don't know if any of our doctors have",
    "any comments in regards i actually",
    "i don't think there's much to add",
    "governor i think you covered it very",
    "well",
    "and you really emphasize this point that",
    "we're trying to hit hard which is that",
    "what we do outside of school affects",
    "what we can do in school",
    "um it's clear that there's going to be a",
    "lot more discussion around sports and",
    "that those decisions",
    "and i think we just have to wait on",
    "those discussions",
    "anybody else okay",
    "next question our next question is uh",
    "from marty schleyden at the ohio capitol",
    "journal",
    "good afternoon governor um i wanted to",
    "switch over to the economy",
    "uh quickly uh yesterday yeah",
    "your administration announced it was",
    "going to try to",
    "um put out work with the trump",
    "administration on a 300",
    "a month federal unemployment supplement",
    "would it be",
    "easier administratively and quicker just",
    "to continue",
    "the 600 supplement that was in place",
    "until the end of the month",
    "and also one of the sticking points",
    "between congressional democrats and the",
    "trump administration is 900 billion",
    "dollars",
    "for state and local governments uh where",
    "would you come down on that argument",
    "well first of all i am the eternal",
    "optimist",
    "i spent 20 years in congress i've seen",
    "hopeless cases where no one thought",
    "there could be a deal and there was a",
    "deal",
    "i saw it time after time after time so",
    "i'm an optimist",
    "i think there's a deal to be had between",
    "the house and the senate uh in the",
    "administration and i",
    "you know urge congress to to get about",
    "the job of of getting that done i think",
    "they can",
    "second i think what the president did",
    "was the right thing",
    "uh president was looking at a stalemate",
    "uh he wanted to move the ball maybe push",
    "uh get some people to negotiate more but",
    "also try to do something that was be a",
    "positive thing",
    "uh and so the three hundred dollars that",
    "he's talking about we have people in",
    "ohio who",
    "really need that money and we want to",
    "get that if that's where we end up but",
    "that's what",
    "the final thing is from the",
    "administration uh then we want to get",
    "that money out",
    "to people as fast as we can",
    "as far as ohio adding to that you talked",
    "about 600",
    "we don't have the ability to do that um",
    "you know we're looking in an economy uh",
    "that while we're optimistic about it",
    "while it's coming back our unemployment",
    "has gone down",
    "we hope it will continue to go down but",
    "we also know",
    "that we are facing the covet we're still",
    "fighting",
    "the covid we know what impact that has",
    "on the economy",
    "and so you know there's no money in the",
    "unemployment fund",
    "to do this um you know we would have to",
    "take the money from",
    "someplace else um we're looking",
    "at keeping money set aside for",
    "testing and things that we absolutely",
    "have to do to keep people safe",
    "so that our not only do we keep people",
    "safe so that our economy can continue to",
    "to move to move forward so um",
    "number one i hope uh to recap congress",
    "needs to get",
    "this done and they need to get to get it",
    "out and and get the whole",
    "the whole package done to i think the",
    "trump administration i thank them for",
    "doing this",
    "uh they have indicated uh to us that",
    "uh we could take this three hundred",
    "dollars and get this money out and",
    "that's what we intend to do we're",
    "awaiting instructions",
    "specifically about how how that how that",
    "would work",
    "so thank you our next question is from",
    "adrian robbins",
    "at wcmh in columbus",
    "hi governor thank you for doing this",
    "again um a new",
    "cdc analysis showed that black children",
    "and hispanic children were far more",
    "likely to be hospitalized if",
    "they do contract cover 19 than white",
    "children",
    "are you concerned with the tools sending",
    "children back to school",
    "could take on the minority communities",
    "that have already suffered",
    "disproportionately during this pandemic",
    "yes i'm going to refer to the doctors",
    "for any",
    "uh in regard to",
    "our african-american young people or",
    "hispanic young people",
    "and you know the doctors cited and you",
    "cited",
    "the large number of uh young people who",
    "end up in the hospital much more",
    "likely to end up in a hospital and it's",
    "the same way with adults",
    "um so it's just tragic it's very very",
    "tragic let me see if any of the doctors",
    "want to make a comment",
    "just just just a couple of comments um",
    "true what we see in ohio is seen",
    "nationally underrepresented minorities",
    "are much more likely to test positive",
    "and they're much more likely to bear the",
    "burden of the",
    "complications in the disease including",
    "hospitalizations and maybe even",
    "icu stays so it is something to be very",
    "concerned about as",
    "schools open and i do think this is the",
    "governor's strategy in allowing schools",
    "to make local",
    "decisions based on their their um",
    "local conditions the the challenges are",
    "under representing minority patients is",
    "is um is how often",
    "uh multi-family living situations",
    "or um use of public transportation",
    "uh frequently essential worker",
    "status and so it's just a real it's just",
    "a real",
    "challenge and an unfortunate dimension",
    "to this pandemic",
    "you know we continue to have disparities",
    "in health",
    "based on race and there's absolutely no",
    "doubt about that",
    "we're going to be talking about this",
    "sometime the next week",
    "in in in more detail dr acton and i",
    "and and the lieutenant governor talked",
    "about this on several different",
    "occasions we had other doctors who came",
    "in and who talked about it so it is one",
    "of the tragedies",
    "that we live with uh and we all have an",
    "obligation a moral obligation",
    "uh to change that and and so we're gonna",
    "continue to work with the state",
    "legislature to do everything that we can",
    "in this area and we'll have",
    "more to say about this uh probably later",
    "this later this week",
    "but it's a great tragedy and i am",
    "concerned",
    "and governor if i might if i might say",
    "this is",
    "also the same demographic that will have",
    "challenges with access to web services",
    "and virtual school",
    "as well so it's just a real catch-22",
    "it is it is absolutely",
    "next question governor your next",
    "question is from",
    "jackie borchert at the cincinnati",
    "inquirer",
    "uh good afternoon governor uh thanks for",
    "making the doctors available to us today",
    "we've heard from many people who have",
    "waited a week or more to get their",
    "coronavirus test results",
    "public health officials say that",
    "anything past about two days is not",
    "helpful as far as tracing",
    "and stopping additional transmission um",
    "your pcr test came back the same day uh",
    "what is your plan for making that kind",
    "of testing turnaround available to all",
    "ohioans yeah look i i work on this every",
    "day my team works on this every day",
    "we're not unique other states have have",
    "this problem that doesn't mean that",
    "it's not a problem it is a big big",
    "problem and you're right the longer",
    "it goes before you get the data comes",
    "back then the less the tracing",
    "and the contact tracing value that it",
    "has",
    "and so when you're five days six days",
    "seven days that's just",
    "not where we want to be uh",
    "at all uh so we're doing a number of",
    "things",
    "uh in in regard to",
    "getting more testing where we've seen",
    "some of the long lags for a couple a",
    "couple things going on just i just mean",
    "two of them uh once once some of the",
    "testing that's being done in ohio is",
    "going to national",
    "labs it's not us but you know we",
    "welcome all the testing but some of us",
    "going to national labs and they're",
    "they're behind quest for example is",
    "behind they know they're behind",
    "they're doing everything they can to",
    "close close that gap",
    "some of the other national labs have",
    "started to close the gap and are",
    "doing a much much better job in addition",
    "to that we have some of our hospitals",
    "who",
    "are frankly being strangled because they",
    "can't get enough reagent",
    "the reagent is being allocated to states",
    "that are hotter than ohio",
    "um you know one of the good things and",
    "but also it has a disadvantage",
    "uh never have we been a really really on",
    "fire state",
    "uh you know we never were new york uh we",
    "never were texas in california in",
    "different",
    "other states at different periods of",
    "time uh we've always been",
    "it while we're much we're certainly",
    "higher than we want to be",
    "um you know we're not near what the",
    "positivity rate",
    "uh you know we're at 5.2 or something uh",
    "and",
    "you saw on the map we got some states",
    "that are much higher so",
    "many times that gets directed uh to",
    "those states",
    "that are hotter than we are which",
    "lessens the amount of",
    "uh the reagent that or whatever the",
    "product is that is going to some some of",
    "our hospitals so",
    "we watch these numbers and we're going",
    "to continue to try to expand our testing",
    "and the more options we have for testing",
    "the more opportunity we're going to see",
    "get that back",
    "we're talking with the company right now",
    "in regard to doing some trials and if",
    "those trials work",
    "this is saliva if that trials work for",
    "that we might be able to expand that",
    "uh rather dramatically in in ohio so",
    "uh it's a problem we know it's a problem",
    "and",
    "we've been doing everything we can to",
    "cut the time down",
    "and to get more testing next question",
    "our next question is from max philby at",
    "the columbus dispatch",
    "hi governor um your administration has",
    "uh",
    "every week released information",
    "including the number of",
    "new cases and deaths at uh long-term",
    "care facilities",
    "and i'm wondering if that's something",
    "you're considering requiring school",
    "districts to do and why or",
    "why not that might be well that's an",
    "excellent question",
    "um it's an excellent question uh we will",
    "we will look at that",
    "and get get back to you um",
    "you know i i think generally more",
    "information is better",
    "you know it enables parents to make",
    "decisions",
    "you know particularly in the small",
    "school districts which i have more",
    "experience with",
    "as a parent you know you know what's",
    "going on pretty much in the district",
    "you know if you know there's a problem",
    "in third grade there's a problem in",
    "seventh grade or something like that in",
    "the bigger districts i understand",
    "that information may not flow as easily",
    "out",
    "or automatically so that's something we",
    "will we will look at",
    "and that's something that we would hope",
    "would come really",
    "from the schools but we'll look to see",
    "if there needs to be any kind of",
    "regulations",
    "in regard to that but schools have an",
    "obligation",
    "to keep parents informed about how",
    "everything is going whether they're",
    "remote whether in",
    "uh in person and part of how things are",
    "going obviously has to do with",
    "you know if they're if they're cases and",
    "kids who are",
    "out of school and who've been diagnosed",
    "with with covenant obviously you have to",
    "protect",
    "individual rights and individual",
    "privacy but",
    "looking at it from the big picture and",
    "knowing what's going on these schools is",
    "important",
    "our next question is from jim province",
    "of the toledo blade",
    "hello governor i wanted to get your",
    "reaction to the word that the big ten is",
    "postponing its fall",
    "sports season until at least spring and",
    "would you expect that uh",
    "more will follow",
    "well well as as as a football fan and",
    "we have a lot of them uh in ohio and a",
    "lot of buckeye fans that certainly is",
    "not",
    "is not good news um ultimately",
    "this is a decision that has to be made",
    "by the schools",
    "uh they weigh many things and i'm sure",
    "they start off with the safety of",
    "of their players uh but they're the way",
    "other other factors is",
    "as well so i think it's",
    "a disappointment for",
    "buckeye nation um",
    "importantly it's disappointment for the",
    "young men who play football",
    "uh and who are on ohio state and who",
    "you know whatever year it is uh so",
    "i talked uh this morning with",
    "gene smith and",
    "you know i know they're they they were",
    "looking at maybe doing it in this in the",
    "spring and seeing how things",
    "go in the spring uh those pose that",
    "poses",
    "more challenges so look",
    "as a fan i'm disappointed uh but this is",
    "a decision that was made by the big ten",
    "this is made by the schools and",
    "you know we have to respect that",
    "that decision",
    "our next question is from molly kowig at",
    "whio in dayton",
    "hi governor with the big ten's decision",
    "has that heightened your concerns about",
    "high school athletes",
    "and will the big tens move influence",
    "your decision moving forward when it",
    "comes",
    "to high school athletes and athletes at",
    "other levels",
    "well no no decision is ever made in a",
    "vacuum and all",
    "information is important uh that you get",
    "so",
    "you know i'm certainly i'm sure that you",
    "know there's discussion uh right now",
    "going on uh people are having about that",
    "issue",
    "what i said before i will say again",
    "because i think it's at least for me uh",
    "and for lieutenant governor as we look",
    "at this",
    "uh and we talk to you know we talk to a",
    "lot of people",
    "uh in regard to these decisions about",
    "high school sports",
    "but they are decisions that cannot be",
    "made in a vacuum",
    "it's not a question of are they going to",
    "play football",
    "or not play football are they going to",
    "have wrestling or not wrestling or",
    "whatever the sport might be",
    "volleyball sport our family is a lot",
    "more familiar with which would be cross",
    "country",
    "you know but the basic facts don't",
    "change because of what the",
    "big ten has decided to do",
    "but what i said before again i will say",
    "because i think it's important you can't",
    "make these decisions in a vacuum",
    "parents can't schools can't our",
    "administration",
    "can't i think you have to look at what",
    "are the things that that student would",
    "be doing",
    "uh what discipline can be gained by",
    "being in a sport",
    "and that's one of the things that we",
    "usually associate with",
    "sports there's a discipline",
    "self-discipline",
    "discipline for the team",
    "and part of that discipline this year uh",
    "you know for teams that play",
    "is going to be let's let's have a season",
    "let's have a full season",
    "and what we do not just on the playing",
    "field or in the practice field but what",
    "we do",
    "as as a team members uh in our spare",
    "time",
    "and when we're home and other players",
    "when we're out",
    "is going to determine um you know what",
    "chance we have to have that that",
    "particular season",
    "so uh look it's it goes it goes into the",
    "mix it's",
    "part of what people are certainly",
    "talking about and uh",
    "that's about all i have to say at this",
    "point anyway",
    "thank you governor your next question is",
    "from",
    "noah blundo at hannah news service",
    "hello good afternoon governor uh my",
    "question i believe is for the doctors",
    "i'm wondering",
    "how much information they feel that",
    "they've",
    "had access to in their studies of this",
    "that's",
    "focuses directly on the possible thread",
    "of course in",
    "in environments that are akin to school",
    "because",
    "students haven't been in school up to",
    "this point and they've been maybe even",
    "more isolated as a group than adults",
    "because",
    "they don't have jobs to go to and such",
    "so",
    "you know how much experiences they're",
    "out there to",
    "look at when you're evaluating the risks",
    "directly on point to having students in",
    "an environment like school",
    "who wants to take that at that",
    "that's a great question we don't because",
    "we haven't had school in place during",
    "the",
    "you know the bulk of the time we've been",
    "living with covent we don't have a lot",
    "to go off of direct experience but we do",
    "have some camp stories and there's a",
    "story of a camp in georgia published",
    "recently",
    "that went through a very detailed",
    "contact tracing report of what happened",
    "when one camper",
    "came down with covid and you know i",
    "think what we learned",
    "from that story very at a very high",
    "level is that you know children who are",
    "in close quarters these are children who",
    "are",
    "um many of whom are overnight campers",
    "those who are at higher risk",
    "uh it wasn't clear how rigorous the",
    "masking protocol was",
    "um so we learned from that one large",
    "story that that",
    "children are at risk and that children",
    "who are participating in",
    "activities where they're in close",
    "contact and not practicing those four",
    "practices that we talked about um with",
    "with",
    "vigilance and rigor that a lot of",
    "individuals will get sick very quickly",
    "and but that's all we have to go off of",
    "we don't have a lot of other",
    "large volume large grouping of children",
    "experiences so",
    "you know moving forward with school",
    "there's a lot of uncertainty about how",
    "this is going to go",
    "and i think a lot about our early days",
    "as children's hospital",
    "uh children's hospitals leaders and and",
    "children's hospitals in general and",
    "hospitals in general dealing with covid",
    "we learned a lot",
    "in the first few days and weeks and",
    "months in terms of our own dealing with",
    "coping",
    "and our schools are going to do the same",
    "and we'll have to support them as they",
    "learn and maybe pivot and shift and make",
    "different decisions than they started",
    "with as they learn",
    "i think that's the best that we can hope",
    "for thanks doctor",
    "anybody else patty i'd also like to add",
    "that",
    "and first of all patty is spot on with",
    "her response",
    "schools have opened in other countries",
    "and so there are also lessons we've",
    "learned from",
    "some of the things that have hurt some",
    "have done it successfully some of it not",
    "as successfully",
    "i think you get back to what dr manning",
    "has stressed",
    "you have to do it but you got to do it",
    "right and it depends on the community's",
    "effort",
    "to keep the infection at bay",
    "not just what the school is doing",
    "actually i'll just chime in adam that's",
    "thank you for the reminder because",
    "uh there was an excellent report from",
    "israel about a school that opened and",
    "many high school students um came down",
    "very quickly with covett and",
    "uh in reading that study that report it",
    "was very interesting how",
    "many things that they chose to do in the",
    "moment because of a heat wave",
    "how that really hurt their efforts",
    "closing the windows taking off masks",
    "worsening ventilation uh it was like a a",
    "recipe",
    "for cobit and so we learned from that",
    "not to do that",
    "dr manning you want to you want to give",
    "the uh",
    "your five things again quickly because",
    "that's that's the summary so",
    "and i really have to thank our",
    "infectious disease colleagues who've led",
    "the way on this",
    "on this learning but four things in",
    "order of importance plus",
    "number five the first one is masking the",
    "second one is distancing",
    "the third one is hand hygiene the fourth",
    "is cleaning surfaces",
    "and then when you can do some work",
    "around ventilation in addition to all of",
    "those",
    "you're going to have a very good robust",
    "package of safety for your students",
    "thank you let me just add we're also you",
    "know",
    "monitoring what's going on in indiana",
    "indiana starts school in some places",
    "significantly earlier than we do we also",
    "have real staggered",
    "openings of schools so we're going to be",
    "seeing schools opening fairly",
    "fairly soon and we're going to be seeing",
    "what happens in in those schools",
    "so we're going to monitor this very very",
    "very closely",
    "next question governor this is the last",
    "question today and it will be from uh",
    "tom",
    "galek at gongwer news service hi",
    "governor",
    "we're hearing anecdotally and then",
    "seeing some reports from",
    "teachers unions that a significant",
    "number of teachers might either seek",
    "some kind of medical accommodation",
    "retire or leave the profession are you",
    "worried about the ability of school",
    "districts that return",
    "in person to be able to staff classrooms",
    "at a safe level",
    "uh that's certainly a possibility it's",
    "also you know a possibility once school",
    "starts",
    "that we get teachers who get sick",
    "and so yes absolutely um you know our",
    "belief is that",
    "the superintendents the school boards",
    "people at the local level",
    "can best gauge that and make that",
    "decision but",
    "look this is as as dr manning said uh",
    "there's no real playbook for this",
    "uh we've not had anything like this in",
    "our country uh",
    "you know since 1980 we've seen what's",
    "happened in some other",
    "countries uh we've learned some things",
    "but",
    "you know we're just going to have to see",
    "but sure it's it's absolutely something",
    "to worry about",
    "and look one of the things that we we've",
    "talked about before",
    "is the importance for every school to",
    "try to identify",
    "the students but also particularly",
    "you know their adults whether custodian",
    "or their teacher",
    "whether they work work in the kitchen",
    "wherever who might have some",
    "medical reason to be particularly",
    "vulnerable",
    "and so you know we have to continue to",
    "focus on",
    "on those individuals and as as i've",
    "talked to superintendents",
    "many times they have told me we have",
    "separated them out",
    "you know this teacher will teach",
    "remotely because he or she",
    "has this medical problem uh so i would",
    "just",
    "ask uh all our people in all our schools",
    "to continue to watch out for each other",
    "and to watch out for the people who are",
    "the most vulnerable um",
    "and we know who that we know we know who",
    "those are",
    "thank you that was the last question",
    "uh i'd like to show as we and thank you",
    "the three doctors thank you very very",
    "much we learned a lot from you today and",
    "thank you we're very very grateful for",
    "you being with us",
    "let me show as we uh wrap up a short",
    "video that our bureau of workers",
    "compensation video group",
    "put together for going back to school it",
    "is quick",
    "it is fun and it's a reminder of the",
    "critical things that our students",
    "and school staff do so that everyone can",
    "have the safest",
    "back to school humanly possible and",
    "again",
    "this is what our teachers do every day",
    "this is what our",
    "administrators do whether the covet is",
    "out there or not",
    "they work to protect our kids",
    "it's back to school time and time for",
    "ohio students",
    "to rise up just remember",
    "back up mask up wash up",
    "back up try to stay six feet away from",
    "others",
    "at the bus at lunch when playing",
    "and especially indoors",
