    "harding who owned the marian star",
    "and james cox from dayton who owned the",
    "dayton",
    "daily news and it was an all-ohio",
    "all-ohio show so i'm gonna have fran uh",
    "talk a little bit about uh mrs harding",
    "well it's kind of fun to be here today",
    "in her in their home",
    "you know warren harding and florence",
    "harding built this house",
    "the year that they were married in 1891.",

    "she worked with her husband at the",
    "marion star",
    "he was the owner publisher and she",
    "worked with him",
    "and she was also helped her husband on",

    "favorite recipes",
    "and that was his recipe for waffles",
    "he had this saying that was his favorite",
    "recipe but he had this saying",
    "you eat the first 14 waffles without",
    "syrup but with lots of butter",
    "then you put syrup on the next nine and",
    "the last half dozen you eat swimming",
    "with butter",
    "eaten that way waffles never hurt",

    "have to say i've made this recipe for",
    "mike a couple of times just to try it",
    "out",
    "and the secret to the lightness of it is",
    "that she beat the egg whites separately",
    "and then folded them in",
    "so and many times she served it as a",
    "main dish",
    "um you know not just with syrup but with",
    "a dried beef",

    "of course talking to particularly women",
    "voters",
    "who were going to be casting a ballot",
    "for the very first time that year",
    "to give you a little sense about the",
    "campaign and what it was like",
    "it's totally opposite of what we do",
    "today",
    "when the candidate goes out and gives",
    "speeches everywhere",
    "most the time hardeen is going to stay",
    "here and he'll",
    "entertain thousands of people at one",
    "time who are going to come mostly by",
    "train but some also",
    "venture over ohio's rather suspect roads",
    "and drive here to marion they're gonna",
    "gather before that front porch that the",
    "governor standing on",
    "and five to ten thousand people at a",

    "thousand people",
    "came to marion ohio to listen to him and",
    "give a speech from that very porch",
    "that had been good for business too i",
    "imagine",
    "yes marion's economy did really well",
    "that summer and fall",
    "well that that that really um is great",
    "now some of the time",
    "uh we looked this up and apparently",
    "today he was not campaigning here so",
    "some of the time he must have left here",
    "and gone out and campaigned",
    "is that right he did he and a lot of",
    "folks don't know that he did go off the",
    "front porch",
    "kind of intermittently during the",
    "campaign",
    "to visit other states he would go by",
    "rail in three or four day trips",
    "and then come back to the porch he would",
    "increase that a little bit",
    "through october he ended up visiting 13",
    "other states",
    "mostly he's in charge of the midwest and",
    "the southwest",
    "and his running mate calvin coolidge is",
    "going to take care of speaking",
    "engagements",
    "in the northeast he's not going to even",
    "venture into the south because",
    "that's democratic territory and none of",
    "them",
    "are going to be swing states for the",
    "republicans that year",
    "the solid south for the democrats",
    "absolutely",
    "for many many many years uh tell us a",
    "little bit about the house when was it",
    "built who built it",
    "well the hardings were the first and",
    "only owners",
    "of the house until it came into the",
    "hands of",
    "a private group called the hardy",
    "memorial association",
    "in 1925 after mrs harding died",
    "the hardings had the house built in 1891",
    "then during the year they he and",
    "florence were engaged to be married",
    "and they were married actually right",
    "inside the front door there",
    "by the stairs they lived there for the",
    "next 30 years",
    "so it's very much not a presidential",
    "house",
    "it's a newspaper owner's house a small",
    "businessman's house",
    "it's not one of the fanciest houses in",
    "marion it's a pretty ordinary house",
    "which gives us a great insight into how",
    "just",
    "ordinary folks lived at that time in",
    "history",
    "so you're going through restoration now",
    "and uh you've just built a visitor",
    "center here",
    "how was that how was that funded well",
    "we've done a lot here the past two or",
    "three years we have done a complete",
    "restoration of the harding home",
    "so it will look as much as possible as",
    "how it looked during the 1920 campaign",
    "that includes the grounds as well at the",
    "same time",
    "we have constructed a new building the",
    "warren g harding presidential library",
    "museum",
    "which is adjacent to the harding home",
    "a wonderful partnership went into the",
    "building of this",
    "pro the new building and the restoration",
    "it's about half and half state state",
    "capital funds and the rest was private",
    "donations uh so we really depended upon",
    "both of those avenues of revenues",
    "in completing this project so fran and i",
    "had the chance just a moment ago",
    "literally to to look at",
    "um visitor center we looked into a",
    "couple rooms uh",
    "really really well done uh when will",
    "people be able to see this we are",
    "working toward",
    "opening um what we've done here is",
    "basically we're opening a brand new",
    "historic site",
    "uh it's much different than what we just",
    "what we've been",
    "operating for the past 50 years or so",
    "which is just a house museum",
    "so in addition to trying to open up a",
    "new site you've had covid to deal with",
    "us everyone else has so we are working",
    "our way to our opening",

    "marion have in this home",
    "uh in this history um and in",
    "warren g harding so it's a it's a really",

    "he was a warm-hearted man with most",
    "gracious impulses",
    "he was not one to harbor grievances or",
    "deliberately do injury to any man",
    "he had advanced from state senator to",
    "lieutenant governor and then to the",
    "united states senate",
    "to him that was the ideal public",

    "now many unkind things have been said",
    "and written to mr harding",
    "harsh criticism is the penalty laid upon",
    "most public men",
    "the scandals of his administration",
    "inspired many an accusing word",
    "against his character that he was",
    "amiable to the point of weakness that he",
    "lacked vigilance that he permitted",
    "himself",
    "unfit associates cannot be denied but he",
    "was an honest man",
    "and while the conduct of many close to",
    "him was reprehensible",
    "his own official record was never",
    "tarnished",
    "with dishonor so",
    "i just found out that interesting 100",
    "years ago",
    "back to today we'll start off",

    "uh the average is now pushing 1100 so",
    "we've seen this",

    "two and a half times to almost three",
    "times",
    "the number of cases for the last two",

    "what the cdc says is high incidence so",
    "very frankly these these numbers are",
    "very",
    "uh very alarming um i want to take a",
    "moment to talk about",
    "the positivity um positivity",
    "uh was has been was going down for quite",
    "some time and we were we were just",
    "delighted",
    "again this is if you take the total",
    "number of cases for the day",
    "the tests and then you look at what",
    "percentage actually came back",
    "positive to date our lowest positivity",
    "was in mid to late september",
    "when our single day uh rate dipped to",
    "2.5 percent",
    "several different times our weekly",
    "average was 2.7",
    "and that was really great news it was",
    "2.7",
    "for the week of september 18th today our",
    "daily positivity",
    "was 3.9 percent almost current day",
    "and a seven day rolling average is 3.3",
    "reflects the ongoing increasing trend of",
    "virus spread that we're seeing",

    "numbers are",
    "not good uh eric let's go to the public",
    "health alert",
    "system and we'll look at our map as you",
    "look at it on your left",
    "uh is last week to the right is",
    "this week and you can see uh we're",
    "getting a lot",
    "unfortunately we're getting a lot more",
    "red",

    "this week the highest ever",
    "the virus is spreading in more areas of",
    "the state",
    "and impacting a wider swath of",
    "ohio",
    "again as we talk to public health",
    "departments",
    "what they tell us when they try to drill",
    "down on the causes of this spread",
    "lacks social distancing not enough",
    "people wearing masks",
    "not enough people following quarantine",
    "and isolation guidance",
    "um let's look uh eric at our next slide",
    "if we could",
    "what we've done with this slide",
    "is you will see that the",
    "we've only put on the slide the red",
    "which are the red counties",
    "and the other counties that you see",
    "there in",
    "orange i guess those are high incidence",
    "counties",
    "so if you're watching this at home these",
    "would be the counties",
    "that if you live in one of these",
    "counties you would worry about because",
    "they have a high end",
    "either they have a high incidence uh or",
    "they are",
    "a red a red county which meets means",
    "they meet many of the seven",
    "seven indicators so these are the",
    "counties that were particularly",
    "most most concerned about",
    "again talking with local health",
    "departments a lot of the spread we're",
    "seeing is being driven by everyday",

    "barbecue",
    "meeting up with friends after a sporting",
    "event or going to a birthday party with",

    "yeah this is a developing story i mean",
    "i'm not sure i know everything about it",
    "um look in my childhood",
    "i think one of the on the nixon kennedy",
    "debates was one was on one coast and one",
    "was on the other",
    "uh i mean so i guess i don't i don't see",
    "a problem with it",
    "um",
    "you know i don't know again i'm not not",
    "sure i've read everything that's",
    "occurred today but if you're asking me",
    "about",
    "a remote debate can you do it i think",
    "certainly you could do it",
    "uh you know it may not be ideal uh but",
    "you certainly you certainly can do it um",
    "but again i haven't really followed it",
    "that closely today",
    "next question is uh from jesse palmer at",
    "the cincinnati enquirer",
    "hello governor so there are about 1500",
    "new coronavirus cases reported since",
    "yesterday and you mentioned the higher",
    "positivity rate i guess why are we",
    "seeing this rise what are the things",
    "that you're most concerned about that",
    "ohioans should be aware of",
    "jesse thank you for the question uh i am",
    "deeply concerned about what i'm seeing",
    "um i know that there's some people who",
    "you know sell",
    "it goes to wine again he's you know he's",
    "talking about this",
    "but go back and look at the maps i would",
    "just ask anybody",
    "who doesn't think this is very serious",
    "to go look at the maps and what we have",
    "seen",
    "is a spread that continues and if you",
    "look at",
    "take a look at the map that shows the",
    "counties that are high",
    "incidents which means over that mark",
    "and some of them are almost three times",
    "over that mark",
    "uh mercer county has been on this list",
    "now red list for 10 weeks so what we're",
    "starting to see",
    "in some of these counties is long long",
    "term",
    "set in of a very very high level",
    "and so if you take the counties that",
    "have a high incidence",
    "and you then add in the red counties",
    "it's a lot of counties that's a big",
    "significant part of the state of ohio",
    "so you know you look at those numbers as",
    "a gut punch",
    "uh it just yeah i'm very very concerned",
    "about this",
    "why is it happening we went through it",
    "today",
    "uh people are not being careful i mean",
    "think about the tragedy i mean i just",
    "i can't fathom this but think about the",
    "tragedy of people getting married and",
    "then",
    "two of the grandfathers are dead i mean",
    "we're not blaming anybody but this is",
    "look this is this has got to stop",
    "this has just got to stop i mean these",
    "lives are valuable",
    "these lives matter",
    "we we can do better than this now we",
    "have done well as ohioans",
    "and you know we don't want to be all",
    "gloom and doom we've done well",
    "and we've taken us to this point but",
    "we're now at a point",
    "where it's getting colder",
    "people are more inside we're now",
    "starting to see what we feared",
    "from some of our colleges and from our",
    "schools and that is",
    "a child you know a young person getting",
    "sick okay it's one thing a 20 year old",
    "gets sick",
    "not anything to something to take",
    "seriously",
    "but then that 20 year old goes and",
    "infects a 50 year old",
    "or 60 year old or a 70 year old or",
    "there's someone in their family",
    "and nobody does this on purpose but so",
    "many of the people who have it",
    "don't really have have any indication",
    "that they've got it",
    "so what you're seeing in ohio is",
    "widespread",
    "spread and we're heading into winter so",
    "yeah i",
    "am very very concerned and i would just",
    "say this",
    "we have got ohio we have gotten this far",
    "we have done well",
    "we've not gone over the edge we've not",
    "seen that fire flare up",
    "um but it's it's",
    "it's starting to come that fire is",
    "starting to come",
    "and it's not coming not not just uh you",
    "know it's now in our",
    "rural areas you know it's it's",
    "everywhere",
    "um so yeah i'm very very concerned it's",
    "coming from the things that we talked",
    "about which is basically",
    "people you know not social distancing",
    "going into large groups and seeing",
    "200 300 people at a wedding funeral",
    "um and look",
    "people might say look mike don't you",
    "have to don't we have to go",
    "about our lives and yeah we do that's",
    "the point",
    "we can go about our lives we can do",
    "almost anything we want",
    "and the biggest threat to not doing we",
    "will do almost everything we want is if",
    "we're careless",
    "and we see this spread get so high and",
    "that's what i'm fearful of",
    "i'm fearful of the spread will get high",
    "look we've allowed",
    "schools and we've said we believe in",
    "local control of our schools",
    "and so the schools have made the",
    "decision the schools and the parents and",
    "the school boards",
    "they have made the decision where that",
    "school is all in person",
    "whether they're all hybrid excuse me all",
    "remote or whether",
    "a combination of the two what's going to",
    "start happening is when you see these",
    "outbreak schools are gonna",
    "you know some some are having to go",
    "remote they don't want to go remote but",
    "they're having to go remote",
    "and as this continues schools are going",
    "to have to start looking at this and",
    "saying okay are we",
    "able to keep our school open or are we",
    "going to have to do something else",
    "we want our schools open we want our",
    "kids playing sports",
    "we we want our kids in drama club we",
    "want them doing plays we want them doing",
    "plain instrument we want to do all these",
    "things",
    "the biggest threat to that is what the",
    "people in the community are doing or not",
    "doing",
    "i don't have i don't know how to say any",
    "more blunt",
    "next question is from carl hunnell at",

    "aid well we certainly would like",
    "additional help",
    "you know as we look at the future",
    "you have heard the same things that i've",
    "heard in regard",
    "to when the when the vaccine would be",
    "here",
    "and you know that we will deploy it as",
    "quickly as we can in ohio",
    "but no one thinks that this is going to",
    "be over overnight",
    "uh and so you know we have",
    "we will have continue to have need for",
    "testing uh",
    "and we will continue to have our schools",

    "in the lame duck they will pass a bill",
    "we also frankly need guidance so we're",
    "going to be able to",
    "roll some of this money over and try to",
    "plan for the future",
    "which is what we would like to do uh or",
    "is it going to be necessary for all this",
    "money to be spent before",
    "december 31st which would not be frankly",
    "the most prudent thing to do",
    "but we need that language in a bill",
    "uh my understanding from talking to",
    "legislators uh from",
    "talking to members of congress member of",
    "the house the senate uh",
    "is they think if a bill does get passed",
    "that that will contain that uh ability",
    "to to roll that money over but until",
    "it's done",
    "you know we can't be sure that so yeah",
    "we we definitely",
    "uh need need this legislation uh and we",
    "hope that uh",
    "house senate and the president will be",
    "able to reach an agreement",

    "better",
    "next question is from joe ingles at ohio",
    "public radio and television",
    "good afternoon governor um i have a",
    "question",
    "about poll workers and polling places",
    "coming up",

    "michigan today",
    "that there are uh situations up there",
    "and we may have",
    "similar or you know concerning",
    "situations with security in ohio",
    "we also know that we've seen these these",
    "uh",
    "situations where people throw a fit over",
    "wearing a mask and put",
    "employees and businesses and bad",
    "straights and",
    "now with the way that our polling places",
    "uh",
    "with the way things are going to be",
    "conducted there essentially",
    "it relies on the polling places",
    "and the people working in there to be",
    "the police they're the ones who have to",
    "deal with the mask",
    "they're the ones who have to figure out",
    "what constitutes a threat",
    "or violence or or where police should be",
    "called",
    "in light of that wouldn't it make sense",
    "for the state",
    "to get in front of it and make sure that",
    "every polling place",
    "has proper security or do you think that",
    "the security that there",
    "is enough right now",
    "uh this is something that we have talked",
    "about as far as security",
    "uh quite a bit uh we have involved",
    "um the sheriffs we've involved um the",
    "cities",
    "um counties and so there's been a lot of",
    "discussion going on",
    "a lot of exercises being done",
    "um under the law as you know",
    "you know sheriffs play a particular role",
    "uh in in regard to this so",
    "these discussions you know are going to",
    "continue to to go",
    "on and you know we've got a ways to go",
    "before the actual election day itself",
    "but of course",
    "as you know voting is occurring now and",
    "i know that uh you know there are many",
    "counties where",
    "uh you know there's a sheriff's deputy",
    "who is there",
    "uh and i think that's a good idea you",
    "know",
    "again it's it's it is it is",
    "um and uh now when you go to election",
    "day",
    "um you know we'll we'll we'll cross that",
    "bridge when we get to it but uh",
    "i know i know many of the sheriffs are",
    "supplying security at the request of",
    "local",
    "local boards",
    "next question is from scott halas at the",
    "zenia daily gazette",
    "hi governor how are you today scott",
    "the state health department has given",
    "the bengals and the browns",
    "the go-ahead to have around 12 000 fans",
    "or so with their at their home games the",
    "rest of the year",
    "hamilton's red butler's red montgomery",
    "county is red they're all high incidents",
    "all the areas around cleveland are still",
    "orange i mean is this is this a good",
    "idea with the cases",
    "being on the rise especially when you",
    "know alcohol sometimes is involved",
    "people",
    "have a few drinks maybe their judgment",
    "gets cloud clouded",
    "um is this a good idea you know scott no",
    "none of these are none of these are easy",
    "decisions",
    "um what we did with the bengals and the",
    "browns",
    "um we started 6 000 to see how that",
    "would work",
    "as you know you know those those",
    "stadiums hold a lot more than that",
    "it worked seemed to work pretty well",
    "we thought people were safe inside",
    "we looked to see if we it had an uh a",
    "detrimental",
    "impact downtown for people going or",
    "coming",
    "uh i talked to the mayors",
    "talked to the health officials they did",
    "not seem to think that that was",
    "we said okay well let's let's look at",
    "this i decided to go to 12",
    "000 as a",
    "reasonable place uh reasonable in the",
    "sense that",
    "they would still be able to have",
    "tremendous spread out there",
    "and the people would be able to be you",
    "know have a mask on",
    "and would be safe so we think they're",
    "safe inside my frankly my biggest",
    "concern all along has been what happens",
    "going in and going out",
    "that's where my biggest concern has been",
    "what happens downtown",
    "as far as the fans as you know these",
    "fans are drawn",
    "from you know significant areas",
    "um but um you know again keeping the",
    "distance inside",
    "so is there a risk sure there's a risk",
    "in everything that we do i mean but what",
    "we've tried to do",
    "uh and what we believe people can do uh",
    "is live go ahead and live",
    "and um allowing some more people to go",
    "root for the bengals go root for the",
    "browns is something that people",
    "feel very passionately about i think we",
    "think they can do it safely",
    "next question is from sean lanier at",
    "wcmh",
    "in columbus",
    "hey governor just a quick question with",
    "the numbers of covet obviously",
    "still going up and it's widespread",
    "around the state",
    "you talked about meeting with the",
    "restaurant association and talking with",
    "them about",
    "potentially uh just discussing the last",
    "call order is there any concern that",
    "even with what they have to say seeing",
    "what's happening around ohio that",
    "there's just no way",
    "that you'll lift that order and if if",
    "there is a plan",
    "is there any date or any uh data that",
    "you're looking at to indicate when that",
    "should happen",
    "uh no date no plan um",
    "but again all of this is balancing and",
    "as i'm looking at this",
    "um you know we're not going to shut down",
    "this economy again we're not going to",
    "shut everything down",
    "so the question is how do we live with",
    "it in a safest way as we can",
    "and the things that i talked about today",
    "i'm going to say them again you know",
    "people getting together",
    "and not being cautious big groups and",
    "weddings big groups and funerals",
    "people you know doing other activities",
    "where they're not social distancing",
    "where they're not wearing a mask that's",
    "what's causing",
    "the great bulk of this i mean so that's",
    "where",
    "the major part of the problem is",
    "um could it occur at a football game",
    "could it occur at a",
    "high school football game could it occur",
    "at a bar could it",
    "yeah i mean it could occur a lot of",
    "different places",
    "but what we have to do is try to you",
    "know deal with those things",
    "that are the most likely to cause it and",
    "and here again",
    "it's my plea to the people of the state",
    "of ohio you can control this we've done",
    "a great job we're ohioans we're tough",
    "we're strong we can get through this",
    "but we have to social distance and we",
    "have to wear masks",
    "and we have to not go to events with a",
    "lot of people",
    "uh if we do those things our schools can",
    "stay open",
    "if we do those things our kids can play",
    "sports if we do those things",
    "our kids can go to college if we do",
    "those things",
    "people can go uh watch a football game",
    "at a bar",
    "i mean these are all things that we can",
    "do",
    "um and so i again look at",
    "i again look at the mask i can look at",
    "this mask",
    "is our our kind of our uh pathway to",
    "freedom",
    "this enables me to go places this",
    "enables me to see things",
    "this enables me to see a loved one a",
    "grandchild",
    "um you know we want to live",
    "but we're not going the right direction",
    "and if more of us aren't wearing masks",
    "and if more of us",
    "are not being careful",
    "you know we're not going to be able to",
    "do those things because the spread is",
    "just going to be so high",
    "and look there's nobody watching this",
    "today who wants",
    "a family member to get sick let alone",
    "die",
    "uh as a result of this so let's just if",
    "we're all careful",
    "we can live our lives and and we can",
    "have we can we can live",
    "fine and this thing will be over at some",
    "point we'll get through this",
    "but we want everybody at the other end",
    "of it we want them still alive we want",
    "them to make it",
    "and we don't want them to have gotten",
    "sick and have some long",
    "lasting health problem",
    "look i talked to somebody i know the",
    "other day i had not seen this person",
    "for for some time because she had been",
    "sick uh",
    "and i said how you doing i said are you",
    "back to normal 100",
    "i thought she was she said yeah",
    "except i got some long-term damage",
    "so you know that's not everybody but",
    "again",
    "it's something that we all have to think",
    "about so",
    "let's be careful governor next question",
    "is the last question for today and it",
    "belongs to jack windsor at wmfd in",
    "mansfield",
    "jack you get to end it today",
    "lucky you huh governor how about thank",
    "you jack it's my lucky day thank you",
    "thank you for your answer on tuesday",
    "about the high school student forced to",
    "miss her golf tournament",
    "you said that odh was simply following",
    "cdc guidelines however",
    "she would have been outdoors socially",
    "distanced on day",
    "10 of a 14 day quarantine completely",
    "healthy",
    "and the local health department said she",
    "should play",
    "so there's no legal scientific or moral",
    "justification for keeping her from",
    "playing",
    "on tuesday you also announced we're",
    "going to experiment with antigen",
    "tests in schools tests the manufacturer",
    "says it should be used on",
    "only symptomatic people so we're going",
    "to experiment on our kids with tests",
    "that",
    "failed the white house you said the odh",
    "was hesitant to change policy without",
    "data",
    "if kids aren't spreaders or at risk for",
    "severe illness which is what the cdc",
    "said",
    "what other data are we looking for to",
    "stop the unnecessary",
    "unethical masking testing and",
    "quarantining of our kids",
    "and do we owe this young lady an apology",
    "well first of all jack kids are",
    "spreaders",
    "i don't i don't think there's any much",
    "doubt about that as far as what the",
    "evidence is coming out so that's the",
    "problem",
    "uh that's part of the problem uh look am",
    "my",
    "you know this was a a a horrible thing",
    "for her not to be able to play",
    "and it's a horrible thing for other kids",
    "not to be able to do other things",
    "um and there are other stories that i'm",
    "sure that are out there and the other",
    "parents i'm sure who are watching this",
    "we are simply trying to follow the best",
    "medical advice",
    "we could get and so last week",
    "i put our everybody together and i",
    "pulled in people i pulled in people from",
    "the cleveland clinic",
    "from the ohio state university best",
    "people that we could find",
    "and university of cincinnati",
    "and ask them should we change these and",
    "they said we are reluctant to do it",
    "we do not believe we can do this unless",
    "we have some data",
    "and so we are trying to manage a",
    "pandemic",
    "once in a hundred years and",
    "these are tough situations but remember",
    "our goal",
    "throughout this has been to get kids",
    "many kids in school as we could",
    "and we've always felt that the way you",
    "keep kids in school",
    "uh most the kids is you follow these",
    "guidelines",
    "we're going to look at this and as far",
    "as look",
    "no kid is going to the engine test no",
    "they're not dangerous tests they can be",
    "used",
    "uh in this manner and again we're going",
    "to let the experts",
    "ohio state health experts design",
    "you know what kind of model that we're",
    "going to use i will tell you jack we've",
    "already had",
    "a number of schools that have called us",
    "and said we want to be in this we want",
    "to be in this program",
    "so we'll see and we'll we'll report back",
