much better that's awesome
that is awesome well good afternoon
everyone and happy election day thank
you so much for the chance to
gather here at the ohio state house and
talk about how things are going in ohio
first to look back to the spring as you
remember
way back in march and april we started
to roll up our sleeves and figure out
how are we going to run
a presidential election in the midst of
a pandemic obviously this is a historic
election one
unlike anything we've ever seen and we
keyed in on a few
key priorities really from the very
beginning
one was recruiting massive numbers of
poll workers we knew that we needed to
launch an unprecedented poll worker
recruitment effort
that has been enormously successful as
you know we've recruited and trained
over 56
000 poll workers who were standing ready
this morning at 6 30 a.m to open close
to 4 000 polling locations
all throughout the state this may be the
year that we recruited that new
generation of poll workers maybe a
silver lining from this experience is
this great and energetic new group of
poll workers that we were able to bring
into this important civic
process of course one of the other
things that we focused on from the very
beginning
is the health and safety priorities that
needed to be put in place as you all
know we worked with the cdc in the ohio
department of health
listening to those professionals
scientists doctors and epidemiologists
that
guided us as we created a 61-point
checklist
a 61-point checklist that was employed
today at every polling location
throughout the state and all throughout
the last month at all of our early
voting sites
along with that 61-point health and
safety checklist
was the fielding of massive quantities
of personal protective equipment as you
know
many ohio companies stepped up and
donated hand sanitizer and masks we used
our cares dollars to purchase
the remaining needed quantities of that
and every polling location throughout
the state
is stocked today with the equipment that
they need
of course one of the other priorities
was combating disinformation making sure
that ohioans had reliable and accurate
information that's been
another success and we can point to uh
some success stories there where we've
been able to track down
and bring to justice a group of
individuals that were engaging
in a pernicious act of disinformation of
course this is something that we remain
constantly
vigilant about but happy to report that
we're not seeing any major
incidents of that today throughout ohio
but again we remain constantly on the
watch for it
and then of course maximizing early and
absentee voting was one of our other
top priorities i think it's safe to say
that
you can call this nothing other than a
resounding success when we had
3.4 million ballots that had already
been cast
before the polls even opened this
morning at 6 30 a.m 3.4 million ohioans
who had already voted this is by far a
record-breaking participation rate for
early and absentee voting and something
that we were very
happy to see something that we really
started off from the very beginning
working to encourage as you know
not only with a lot of public
information campaigns that we did to
spread the word about the convenience of
early and absentee voting but also
with mailing out an absolute ballot
request to all 8 million
registered voters in the state and by
the way that's that's another one the
fact that we surpassed 8 million
registered voters in the state of ohio
is a another big success story
of course all of this preparation
culminated in this morning when the
polls opened
all throughout ohio close to 4 000
locations opening up at 6 30 a.m
and i'm happy to report that as we stand
here today election day in ohio is going
smoothly so far
of course as with any election when
you've got that many polling locations
in a big diverse state like ohio there
are going to be a few things here and
there
and we've experienced that throughout
the day and starting from early this
morning
a couple little bumps in the road that
we've been able to work through with our
county boards of elections and
thankfully because
of having the right contingency plans in
place
again happy to report that things are
going smoothly
as many of you know this morning at 5 36
a.m we were notified by the franklin
county board of elections that they were
experiencing problem
problems uploading voter data into their
electronic poll books
of course that's a process that goes on
overnight
when the early voting stops at 2 pm
yesterday then the task begins of
loading that data
into those electronic poll books the
decision was made by the franklin county
board of elections at 5 36 this morning
that they couldn't wait any longer for
that upload to continue
and they decided to switch over to the
backup plan now let's talk about that
quite quite important detail right there
we issued a directive back in july that
required every board of elections to
have this backup plan in place
to be clear what that is is just the old
three ring binders the paper
check-in books that have been used in
the state for many decades and so when
franklin county needed to make that
decision this morning at 5 30 a.m
they were ready to switch over to that
and again that was because of the
contingency planning that we did
working with our county boards of
elections to make sure that we had a
backup plan in place
this is why we have backup plans i'm
happy to say that
the county boards of elections were able
to use their cares act money to make
purchases like this initially some of
the boards said well now we've got to go
out and buy all these three-ring binders
and we've got to print all these pieces
of paper well
again that's why that federal money came
in handy
another incident that wanted to report
in greene county
in greene county we were made aware this
morning that there were some voting
machines that were not functioning this
was in bell brook
in that scenario the vendors that supply
those voting machines
were mobilized and were almost
immediately on site to work to correct
the issue those machines are now up and
running
of course during the time that they were
down the board of elections again had
the backup plan of switching over to
paper ballots that's something that
all the boards of elections are prepared
to do and again something that we
directed them to do to have that backup
plan of having paper ballots available
and again so in this case
that backup plan worked the machine that
was that was not functioning properly at
that time was a dominion image cast x
machine but again happy to report that
those are back up and running
um also want to reiterate something
about the 100 foot buffer around
polling locations as you all know
polling locations have
a special designation under law for a
reason these are places where voters
come to cast their ballots where poll
workers carry out this important civic
function
and within a hundred foot feet of that
polling location no kind of political
activity is allowed to occur of course
voters have been instructed not to wear
hats or shirts with their favorite
candidates
slogan on it and and when you know
enthusiastic voters show up wearing a
shirt or a hat with their favorite
candidate slogan on it they'll be
dealt with in a professional and
friendly manner by the county board of
elections personnel the the poll workers
that are there and
and they've been trained to help
de-escalate that situation and talk
through people
and why that is important but of course
of course nobody
is ever turned away something else that
uh that hundred foot
uh barrier designates is that outside of
that
100 foot zone people are free to express
their their first amendment
protected speech rights they can pass
out uh flyers and
hold signs and that kind of thing but
what will never be tolerated and you all
have heard me say this loud and clear
is any kind of intimidation or
obstruction anything that causes voters
to be delayed
that will not be tolerated and of course
our law enforcement personnel continue
to stand ready
uh should somebody try to engage in such
illegal activity but again happy to
report that we're not getting any
any reports of that also i want to
report a few anecdotes and these are the
things that happen when
again 56 000 people at 4 000 voting
locations all throughout the state
are serving you know millions of
registered voters
in tuscara's county early this morning a
a poll worker left behind the keys
necessary to
activate the voting machines they were
back at the board of elections well a
quick thinking sheriff's deputy got in
his patrol vehicle and
ran lights and sirens all the way back
to the to the board of elections office
to retrieve those keys and
only cost a few minutes time and
thankfully they were able to get that
location up and running that's again the
kind of quick thinking and really
patriotic
and creative service that people render
on election day
in hamilton county we were happy to see
photos this morning
of a large room where they have their
reserve poll workers these are the folks
that are trained and ready to go
they're standing by at the board of
elections in case they need to be called
into service this was something that we
very intentionally did as a state we
told our boards of elections that they
needed to
not only recruit and train that 37 000
bare minimum but they needed to go 50
percent above that
and so if your county board of elections
normally relies on a thousand poll
workers we told you to have 1500 trained
and standing by
and ready to go this is a manifestation
of that right there in hamilton county
and also wanted to point out that there
was one county
that was one poll worker short this
morning we got a call from them
uh they needed a poll worker they didn't
have somebody ready to fill those shoes
and so we reached out to
a non-profit that we've been working
with called pull hero pull hero is a
non-profit group that was started by a
group of college students to recruit
poll workers nationwide we formed a
great partnership with them early on and
they were responsible
for a lot of poll worker recruitment in
ohio well pool hero went into their
database
they found somebody that had volunteered
in that county they got him on the phone
bright and early this morning got them
down to the board of elections quickly
trained up and out at the polling
location and as we speak
that poll worker who we were able to to
locate early this morning is
is running a polling location or helping
to run a polling location here in ohio
that's
awesome news also something that
happened in miami county and really this
is a compliment to their board of
elections there was unfortunately
a woman who ran her car into the polling
location and actually
damaged the wall you can see from photos
where the wall is clearly
cracked and thankfully the woman who ran
her car
into the polling location was okay and
she was able to cast her ballot actually
before leaving the scene
and i'm happy to also report that voting
continued at that polling location the
fire department came down and inspected
it they said that the building is safe
to continue operating of course it's
going to require some repair
in the future but these are the kind of
things that happen again in a big state
like ours and thankfully
because of the the thoughtful work of
the board of elections there in miami
county
they were able to continue voting there
everybody kept a cool calm head
they called in the public safety
professionals to look at the building
and again the woman was okay
and able to cast her ballot so what to
expect tonight
you all have heard me talking for some
time about the way that election night
reporting works in ohio and so here's
the bottom line
starting at 7 30 tonight our boards of
elections actually at 731 will
immediately begin to tabulate
their ballots and and the very first
ballots counted in most cases will be
those early and absentee ballots
it's intuitive why our boards of
elections have been processing those
for weeks now now contrast that to some
of our neighboring states like
pennsylvania and michigan where they
weren't even allowed to start cutting
open
envelopes until today and in those
states they're going to have a delay
because counting
all of those ballots is going to take
time when they just now started today
but again thankfully in ohio
we've been processing processing
absolute ballots since the 6th of
october
there's a few key things to point out
about that because we started processing
ballots on the 6th of october the boards
of elections could contact voters that
made an error that forgot their
signature they could send them the form
in the mail that they need in order to
cure their ballot and start that process
of working with voters and of course
again all of those id envelopes have
been processed they've verified the
identification information checked the
signature against the signature on file
accepted those ballots and they'll be
ready to process right at 7 30.
why this is important to point out is
that you'll see results start pretty
early in ohio as those early and
absolute ballots get tallied and then
around
you know 8 30 8 45 at night as the
precinct
locations start to get their ballots
down to the board of elections you'll
see those begin processing
of course the thing that could lead to a
delay tonight is if a board of elections
receives a large delivery of mail today
if the postal truck shows up today with
tens of thousands of ballots on board
then yes that will cause them to have to
have a little bit longer night
but those are things that we have worked
to uh to mitigate and we've been
reminding ohioans for weeks now to
return their absolute ballots
in fact happy to say that as of last
night the number of outstanding absolute
ballots was
243 023 and my hope is that many of
those 243
023 ohioans have returned their absentee
ballots today the reminder is you've got
to get it to your board of elections
before 7 30 tonight every board of
elections now
for the first time ever in a general
election has a secure 24 7 drop box so
that you can drop it off there
and those will be emptied properly at 7
30. so of course
those late arriving absentee ballots
could cause a delay but
what will happen later on in the night
is that we will report
an accurate but incomplete number now
let me let me dice di
deconstruct that a little bit for you
what we're going to report is going to
be an accurate number
but it's not going to be the final story
as you all understand and i've gotten
these questions over the last couple
weeks will we have a final number on
election night well the answer is of
course not because we never have a final
number on election day that's just not
how
election night reporting works it never
has been uh but what we will have is an
accurate number of everything that's
been received so far
up into this date every absentee vote
every early vote and every in-person
election day vote will be tabulated and
reported tonight
as part of our unofficial tabulation one
of the other things that we're going to
report
is the number of outstanding ballots and
that's something for you to watch
on our election night reporting website
we're highlighting that for the first
time ever we've reconfigured that
website to
put that right at the top the number of
outstanding abstinence ballots again
that
243 000 plus whatever provisional
ballots were cast today
there's a reason why that's important we
know that a large number of those
absentee ballots will come in
over the next 10 days of course boards
of elections can receive ballots
up until the up until and through the
13th of november as long as they were
postmarked by monday november 2nd
we know that every legally cast ballot
must be counted and will be counted
that's how we do it here in ohio that's
what the law says
and so tonight you're going to get a
snapshot in time but the final number
will come weeks later now the question
is
will tonight's number be conclusive well
that'll be up to you to look at that
number and make a determination again if
your favorite candidates ahead by a
million votes and there are yet two
hundred thousand outstanding absolute
ballots i think you can look at that and
say
that that contest is over but if your
favorite candidates ahead by a hundred
thousand votes and there are still two
hundred thousand outstanding absolute
ballots well then just by definition
that contest is not going to be over
until we have the time to count every
single ballot again
when the numbers change between the
unofficial report on election night and
the final certified tally that comes a
few weeks later
that's not a sign of something nefarious
in fact far from it it's a
manifestation of that commitment that
you hear every elections official make
that every voice matters and every
legally cast ballot must be counted
and so that's exactly what we'll do here
in ohio again i
want to want to finish with this really
just remarkable numbers that we reported
yesterday
3.4 million ohioans having already cast
their ballot
really proved something that we've known
for a long time ohio is a leader when it
comes to early and absentee voting
ohio is a state where we intentionally
have made it over the last several years
easy to vote
ohioans are proving that by
participating in record numbers
you see the quote from lincoln over
there that's something that i
printed up and we taped up all over the
office a few weeks ago it's one of my
favorite
and it was as true then as it is today
that the elections belong to the people
and it's their decision and that's
exactly what we're having here in ohio
today and what we will have in ohio is a
free and fair election where every voice
can be heard
in an honest contest with that i look
forward to taking any questions that you
all have
can you tell us whether there is any
outstanding litigation going on right
now
yeah not at this time in fact uh you
know one of the good things that we've
been able to do
is build friendly relationships with
some of these organizations voting
rights groups and that kind of thing
that have a history of litigation with
this office and
and because of that sort of friendly
relationship we're able to talk to one
another and exchange text messages in
fact
i was just on the phone with tom roberts
from the naacp and with andre
washington from the a phillip randolph
institute we have a great working
relationship and a common goal and
mission in mind by the way as well
and so no there's nothing that we know
of of course we're always
ready for that and that's something that
we know is just a part of life here
in ohio jesse hi i have a couple numbers
questions do we have
how many people have voted today or an
estimate of how many people have voted
today
that's not a number that we'll have
until after 7 30. the
the most recent numbers we have was were
put out in that press release that we
sent out yesterday with 3.4 million
absolute ballots casting
and those 3.4 3.4 million are those
all processed and like ready to be
counted at 731
yeah absolutely and that's again that's
the good news story is that in ohio
we're able to process those and and be
ready to count them right away
and so again those boards of elections
have been processing those for weeks now
i actually was just handed a note that
franklin county got their mail today
and they had 4 000 new absentee ballots
that came in today now contrast that
to back in april on election day they
received 20
000 ballots and obviously it takes time
to cut open twenty thousand envelopes to
proof twenty thousand id envelopes check
twenty thousand signatures etc
so i'm happy to report actually that
that number that came in today at
franklin county is four thousand and
we'll see how many come into their
dropbox as well one question please
do you know how many of those absentee
ballots were invalid or had
problems with them yeah so we've been
getting that question as well
let's talk about the the curing process
so we don't have numbers yet for how
many
uh had problems with them that will be
something that will be reported after
the election and something that we look
at very carefully as we do sort of our
after-action review that's a military
term that i use but aar
is sort of our habit of going through
and looking at what went wrong what went
right how we can sustain good things for
the future and improve bad things
one of the things that we'll do is study
that but we were very intentional this
year
about improving the absentee balloting
process
because we knew we were going to see
more first-time absentee voters than
we'd ever seen and that means more
people
that were inexperienced at it that's why
we redesigned the envelopes hopefully
you've seen those
we redesigned the instruction sheet made
it much more
intuitive the old one was a bunch of
legal jargon it was really hard to read
quite candidly and we took it and
redesigned it as a checklist and made it
much more easy to understand
one of the other key things that we did
is we've directed the boards of
elections to pick up the phone
or get on their computer and email the
voter if there's a problem and that's
why filling out that
phone number and email address on your
absentee ballot request form is so
important
if there's a mistake made the board of
elections can contact the voter now that
doesn't replace the paper copy they need
hard copy still
they have to mail something to you so
you can get your signature on it or ask
you to come down to the board of
elections
but that phone call can can help start
the process and so i believe
that we're going to see a better than
past records
for sort of the cure rate and being able
to fix those errors and remember that
continues for seven days
after the election adrian
are you prepared tonight to possibly
need to defend the results if if there
are claims that they're inaccurate
um and then do you still believe that
ohioans will accept the results once
they are
out even if they are unofficial tonight
yeah i believe they will
and and and what um what drives that
belief
is my knowledge of how elections are
structured in ohio
and it starts at the local level with
these really dedicated bipartisan teams
that do the work
it continues to the transparency that's
built into the process as i always say
in elections there's nothing to hide
everything is an open book you can go
and tour the board of elections and see
what's happening and observe the process
and even some boards for example
because their facilities are too small
to allow people in
for social distancing purposes they're
they're they're going to do a webcast of
the
of the tabulation process for anybody
that wants to watch that some of the
county boards have made that decision
and so again everything's very
transparent in elections but ultimately
for you know
our entire history um we've had this
very good history in this country of
understanding that when the people speak
the elected officials need to listen
right and we respect that what
we hear today will be the true voice of
the people of ohio
and anybody that tries to call into
question the validity of ohio's process
just simply doesn't understand the
process
i will defend ohio's process and the
voice of the people of ohio
because i know it's a good process and
again we won't have final results
tonight and so if it is a narrow margin
between one candidate or the other and
simply speaking
we may have to wait more time before we
hear what the people of ohio foley had
to say
thank you thanks adrian secretary to
your left yes sir um
last night you had tweeted something
about an investigation into voter
intimidation something you brought up
again today there was
somebody who apparently was joking on
social media about
working at a poll location throwing
ballots away you said that was
investigated could you elaborate on what
the investigative process
is for those situations and you kind of
touched on it there but
do you worry that that could damage the
confidence in the system or
undermine the process when things like
that are out there in this
age where people are able to say
whatever they want on any form
well that's why specifically we react so
quickly to these kind of things
voter confidence is one of the most
important responsibilities i have in
maintaining that rightful confidence
that people should have in our process
is something that we focus on absolutely
every single day of course beyond that
there's no such thing as any tolerable
level of voter fraud or voter
intimidation or suppression the good
news is those things are rare they're
rare because we keep them rare
and we react and we take them seriously
now
we find out about these things through a
variety of different ways but
interestingly most often we found find
out on social media
sometimes we also find out because of
the relationships we've built
with members of the community i mean i
was very intentional over the last year
and a half
about going around the state and doing
disinformation training with minority
community leaders and we were doing them
in person back when that was possible
and then we transitioned them to be
to be virtual but it was a briefing
about understanding what is different
disinformation how to combat it how to
report it
as a result of those relationships we
built that's how we found out about the
this honestly this racist robo-call that
was happening in cleveland weeks ago
we were it was reported to us by an
alert voter
who said something's wrong here and they
went to report ohiosos.gov that's the
email address and they reported it to us
and to their member of congress we
worked with
other their member of congress as well
and as a result there was that process
there is now a criminal indictment and
there will be hopefully a prosecution
for this
uh the issue last night um you know what
what happened when we found out about it
is that we immediately got on the phone
with the franklin county board of
elections where this person claimed to
have been
a poll worker thankfully we were able to
find out that they were in fact not a
poll worker
they were somebody that was shooting off
on social media about something that
they thought was funny
which is not funny you know talking
about tampering with people's
sacred right to vote is something that
we consider no laughing matter and
that's why we respond aggressively like
that to make it clear
just like the incident that happened
where there was a person that claimed to
be an ohio state student
probably wasn't it was an anonymous
account but claimed to be an ohio state
student who was going around the dorms
and throwing away people's ballots if
they were known
supporters of a candidate that they
didn't like we aggressively responded to
that too to make it clear to people
that that's no laughing matter that's
actually you're
going online and admitting to to a
potential crime when you talk about that
and so it's important for people to
understand that that kind of thing is
never tolerated
so yeah go ahead let's secretary um
can you talk a little bit more about
absentee voting and
and maybe some of the problems that
people have had with signatures
or that being unverified um i've seen in
florida
it looks like some minorities and
younger voters had more of their ballots
rejected
based on signature issues i just want to
know if that was something you're seeing
in ohio
well the most common error is people
leaving their signature off that
i think the next thing is date of birth
or wrong identification number or not
putting an identification number on
there but again
in ohio there's this really thoughtful
process that allows for seven days after
the election for that curing process to
continue and so that will be going on
again for the next seven days beginning
tomorrow and
and it has been going on for four weeks
already as the boards of elections get a
ballot in if there's a problem they
contact the voter
because of that process i think that
ohio creates much
greater opportunity to fix the problem
again those are the kind of things that
we anticipate
absentee voting for somebody that's done
it for the first time
you know it involves a few extra steps
and again i talked about the silver
lining of recruiting new poll workers
one of the other silver linings i hope
that comes out of this experience that
we've all been living through
is that we've got more people now that
have tried absentee voting for the first
time and said
hey that works out pretty well i want to
do that again this is why we've also
been really encouraging people to track
their ballot
if you saw the absentee ballot request
forms that we sent out to 8 million
registered voters we prominently
featured on their
voteohio.gov track so you can go there
and see if your ballot's been received
in the public service announcements that
we did and i think every media
appearance that i've done over the last
several months we were telling people to
use voteohio.gov
track and so i think because of those
safeguards in place then
you know we've come a long way now as
you know i've long been a fan of of
creating an online
request process that's something that
we'll have to do here at the state house
i've been
asking for that since i served in the
state senate five years ago
and that would be another good step
forward to help again further improve
and modernize the process but ohio has a
very good absentee voting process again
the brookings institution a non-profit
nonpartisan think tank very highly
regarded international think tank
they evaluated all 50 states and among
the states that do absentee voting where
you request a ballot and then they mail
you one ohio is ranked top
out of all of those states and again
that's something we're proud of but we
never don't rest on our laurels there's
there's always more that we can do
thank you as your characterized turnout
today
and then touch on turnout today
statewide yeah
and then explain for a little bit about
how fast the tabulation may go this
evening since we did have such an
incredible number of people voting early
yeah when they start that tabulation
we're talking instead of waiting until
11 or 12
maybe at least half of the tabulation
starting at eight or nine
is that correct you know i'm not going
to make wishful thinking what's that
i'm not going to make a firm prediction
on how quick tabulation will go i'll say
this
that all of our boards of elections are
eager to get that done
uh they've all been putting in a long
day and of course elections run on
caffeine as you know but even that runs
out after a certain period of time
the boards of elections what they're
never going to do is sacrifice
accuracy for speed i can tell you having
observed a lot of boards of elections
and their tabulating process back when i
was a member of the state senate because
i was working on elections issues i
started this habit of traveling around
and spending election day at different
boards of elections and just sort of
being
a fly on the wall to watch their process
the thoughtfulness and intentionality of
our boards of elections is
really a sight to behold these people
are very serious about their work and
they're going to make sure that every
legally cast
ballot that is in as of today will be
counted
and reported accurately in that
unofficial result and yes i think it'll
go
a little bit quicker because we've had
such a incredible number of absentee and
early votes
but again we'll we'll let the process
play out tonight
as it relates to turnout and
participation
i've got some some numbers here and
we've been looking at these as you know
i've got a little wager with the
michigan secretary of state to try to
see which state can have the highest
turnout but
more important than that is just the
great civic exercise that we're seeing
with the high level of participation the
participation in 2008
was 5.7 million 5.7 million in 2008 an
incredibly high number
uh 5.6 in 2012 again 5.6
in 2016. i think it's safe to say that
we're going to surpass that
i think that the 3.4 million that have
already voted is an incredible number
and i think that there's a chance that
we're going to have a record-breaking
day in the state of ohio all-time
record-breaking day
for the number of voters participating
and that's something that is nothing but
good news and by the way
again it exemplifies what i've been
saying for weeks and that is that it's
easy to vote in ohio and that's
something that we're proud of
yes sir
oh sorry go ahead joe hi um
right now on a website uh that supports
president trump
trump trains are being called for
in all 88 counties to drive around
polling locations after 5 pm
we've seen these trump trains on
highways and stuff throughout ohio
they they're calling for them to be in
the neighborhood polling locations in
those
those vicinities what are you doing to
make sure that
the drop boxes are going to be available
to everyone that the traffic congestion
isn't going to be so bad that it's going
to scare voters away
yeah joe as you know any of us that have
ever been around
campaigns know that there's this nervous
energy in the final hours where people
are looking for any way to express
support for their candidate whether it's
waving signs or passing out flyers or
whatever else and
of course you know people sounds like
have come up with a creative way here to
express their support for the candidate
that they like
certainly if that activity gets in the
way of people getting to a polling
location then again that'll have to be
addressed by
local law enforcement to do proper
traffic management to remind people that
you know
the the ingress and egress from a
polling location can't be obstructed but
again if people are simply driving
around expressing support for their
favorite candidate that's protected
first amendment activity
what would not be tolerated and what
would be dealt with by law enforcement
is anything that obstructed or delayed
or
you know made it difficult for people to
get to a polling location or to drop off
their
their their ballot at the dropbox are
you do you have people
looking out for this and standing by to
make sure that this doesn't
impede upon voters being able to get in
now well absolutely 56 000 of them i
mean
and what i mean by that is it starts
with those precinct elections officials
the voting location manager at each
location
uh the voting location manager doesn't
just sit behind a table all day she
she steps outside and looks around to
make sure things are going smoothly
in our parking lot and as you know in
ohio we offer curbside voting for people
that need that that's long been an
accommodation
for the handicap goes back to a time
when buildings didn't have accessibility
but now it's being used
for people that may have symptoms or may
have a known exposure or for whatever
other reason want to vote curbside and
so the poll workers will be in and out
of the polling location stepping outside
and keeping an eye on that kind of thing
again certainly we've got a team
that's watching social media which tends
to be the place where we find out about
these kind of things
and then again law enforcement our
sheriff's deputies our
our municipal and local police
departments are are watching they know
that their responsibilities on election
day includes the safety
and access to polling locations that was
laid out in that memo that i sent to law
enforcement bodies close to a month ago
and so again if people are out there
expressing their support for their
candidate
that's a fine thing if anybody's getting
in the way of voters coming and going
then you know hopefully a friendly
reminder hey don't block this entrance
or hey why don't you take this over
there
will be enough but if the friendly
reminder doesn't work then maybe law
enforcement would have to get involved
and that's something that
i don't want to say is routine but it's
something that we're ready for
yes sir interesting question secretary
the liberal group called protect
the results is planning on staging
protests
at about 10 different ohio cities
tonight should trump
declare victory ahead of definitive
results
what will you do if president trump
declares victory without any definitive
results in ohio
yeah what i'll do is point to the facts
and again
anyone can declare anything i suppose
but the facts will speak for themselves
and that's why we've reconfigured our
election night reporting website
to be more transparent than it's ever
been to really highlight that number of
outstanding absentee ballots to make
sure people can see
that when the folks when the voters of
ohio spoke we're listening
and by the way that means if they've
delivered a an overwhelming victory to
one candidate or another then yeah you
can probably look at those unofficial
election night results and say this is a
conclusive result
but if they've delivered a narrow lead
to one candidate or the other
and they're still sufficient absentee
and provisional ballots that could
change that
uh well then certainly uh it'll be too
early to call
and we'll have to allow the process to
play itself out as the law requires in
ohio again
ballot at the last minute and and it's
going to take a few days to arrive at
the board of elections
every legally cast ballot must be
counted and if there's an overwhelming
result that
makes the election night report uh
conclusive
and and people are able to to say yeah
this this one's over
uh well then you know that that is what
it is but if it's too close to call
uh then i'm gonna be clear about listen
the people of ohio are speaking and
they're not done yet
how's that
yes sir there were some uh reports this
morning on social media about problems
with curbside voting in cuyahoga county
could you
address that yeah so we
found out about this actually i think
was
anders uh twitter feed that we we first
found out about it on uh when a voting
rights group
um had shared it on a on a conference
call honestly that was a little
disappointing because these same voting
rights groups are people that we have
constant communication with and we're in
close you know have close working
relationships with because again
their mission is our mission making sure
every vote can be cast in a free and
fair election
um and so we were disappointed to sort
of hear that it was raised in a
conference call and then
reported on social media by a member of
the journal journalism community before
it was sort of reported to us but again
we don't really have any other
information about it other than what
we've seen we called cuyahoga county
board of elections as we always do we've
got a constant line of communication
with these
boards of elections but again it doesn't
appear to us that there's certainly any
systemic problem with curbside voting
you know curbside voting has been part
of the law in ohio for a long time
chances are we're seeing more of it this
year than we've seen in the past
and in that instance if you know maybe
if one person is being served by the
the designated team of poll workers then
uh then then somebody else may have to
wait for a few minutes that's to be
expected but
from what we can tell curbside voting is
going smoothly throughout the state
thank you yeah hey secretary um
the apparently the lines at the drop
boxes i'm wondering if someone's in line
at 7
30 but the line extends beyond the voe's
uh
parking lot um will
um will everybody who's in line
no matter how long the line goes off the
the property will
will boards of elections keep those
lines open until everybody gets through
the dropbox line
yeah the the short answer is yes and and
we were clear about this back in the
primary and as you know
you know the the the expansion of drop
boxes that we did this year means that
every county board of elections now has
one that wasn't the case just
several months ago but now every county
board of elections has them and so that
question came up in the spring
just like anybody who's in line at a
polling location at 7 30 gets to vote
anybody who's in line to drop off a
ballot at a
board of elections uh secure dropbox at
7 30 will get to drop off their ballot
and by the way i do want to point out
your mask because today
of course is kind of a cool day given
that this is the 100th anniversary
of women's suffrage and something that's
really worth celebrating and so thank
you for pointing that out
for the record it says voting like a
girl since 1920.
that's awesome that's awesome thank you
you've observed the
elevating since it's when it started
october 6 to this time you probably must
have
received feedback
especially from the new american
community
do you have any message for that
community
well dave as you know we stood in this
room
several months ago at a naturalization
ceremony
one of the most moving and emotional
things anybody can ever be a part of and
i think that
many of us who are born as american
citizens
don't have the same depth of
appreciation for really what a profound
thing it is to vote
as those who had to earn their american
citizenship and many of the readers of
of your publication are are among those
for those that are first-time voters
this year congratulations welcome to our
big american family thank you so much
for being a part of the process
we hope that you continue to be a voter
for many years to come
we also know that for and again this is
the age-old american story this was my
family's story 90 years ago when my
great-grandfather came from italy
for people for whom english is the
second language sometimes you know
the language on the ballot can be a
little bit hard to
to read and so uh wherever possible we
try to have bilingual
uh elections officials that's why we
asked the question on the recruiting
forum right there where it says do you
have any additional language proficiency
so that where possible people that have
additional language proficiency
can be placed at polling locations where
that could come in handy and as you know
in many counties in ohio
there are requirements for bilingual
ballots that
that of course are observed by our
county boards of elections and so
when we say every american citizen
who's registered to vote deserves to
cast a ballot that's exactly what we
mean
and it's really something to celebrate
when a new american
gets to be a part of that process thank
you
mr secretary yes sir uh ohio recorded a
record number of
covet cases today over 4 000 have you
had any
or heard of any issues of people not
wearing masks at the poll and what is
that number
of four thousand cases in the middle of
a huge election mean to you
yeah so what that number means to me is
that our preparations were so important
you know back in the spring when we were
first starting to talk about this i
remember saying to our team
when october comes and people start
going inside again
i'm no epidemiologist but it tends to be
the times that
the infection rates can rise and and
unfortunately that's exactly what we've
seen
that's why we started taking this
seriously from the very beginning
we didn't look the other way and hoped
that this would go away we started
making the preparations necessary
i mean thousands of gallons of hand
sanitizer
millions of masks out at polling
locations this 61 point
uh health guidance if you haven't seen
it yet it's something to behold i'm
actually quite proud of it it's a
checklist
maybe this is from my time in the
military but i'm a big fan of checklists
i think it's a
great way to to take a complex set of
tasks and organize it into a sort of an
easy to work from document
these bullet points in here the boards
of elections have been following those
checklists they've been using the ppe
that they have to create a safe and
healthy environment at their polling
locations my bottom line to people has
been this
if you feel comfortable going to your
grocery store you should feel
comfortable coming to your polling
location
many of the same health and safety
protocols infected many more some of you
were with me up in delaware county on
sunday where we were
demonstrating we walked through sort of
a mock polling location and showed
visually those preparations and and that
was something important for people to
see so that they could be reassured and
of course if anybody
has continuing concerns if you're immune
compromised
or if you're you're self-symptomatic you
can vote curbside and that's one of the
great accommodations that we have in our
house so truly
in this probably the most complex
election we've ever conducted the most
difficult set of circumstances we've
ever faced in a presidential election
we've found these very creative ways
still working within the framework of
ohio's law because again
we don't stop following the law just
because there's a pandemic but
working within the framework of our laws
and being creative about it we've been
able to create the right accommodations
it also
highlights why it was so important that
we had
ample poll workers and i got to tell you
i had to be tough with some of the
boards of elections about this
throughout the last several months
many of them said oh you know we've got
enough we don't need to recruit anymore
and i told them you need to get to that
150 percent market and the reason why
was because if
as we have seen there was a spike in the
virus we knew that there could be people
calling off or people that
god forbid became infected and then
couldn't couldn't work and so having
those backup poll workers
has been so crucial to make sure that no
voter came to a voting location this
morning and found the door locked
right i mean that's what had happened in
some other states way back at the
beginning of this pandemic where they
just didn't have enough poll workers you
can't open a polling location with no
poll workers
and so having the uh the correct number
of poll workers has been such a focus
from the very beginning
for that reason yes sir
i have another question about the
outstanding ballot count
the turkey outcome um just pulled up the
live results page
looks really really good um the ballots
are broken down by county
um is it going to be broken down at the
end of the night or eventually
uh per the congressional district races
or the state legislative races or just
by county
thank you so uh if you look at the the
website that we have
you can look at historic results from
past elections that's exactly how it'll
be reported again this year and it goes
into quite granular detail of course
what you will see tonight in many cases
will be much more top line
numbers as we do that unofficial canvas
tonight
but in the final tabulation when we
release those official certified results
at the end of the month that's when
you'll be able to drill down into a much
more detailed
analysis of not only county by county
and district by district but also
methodologies early votes versus
absentee votes versus in-person election
day votes
and that kind of thing so i have another
question about the absentee ballot count
will you be releasing that data in
chunks or all at once
yeah so as far as the number of
outstanding absentee ballots
um no when they're once they're counted
at 7 31 once they start being counted
it's really all aggregated together as
the counties are reporting
again the very first numbers that you're
going to see in most cases it may say
zero precincts reporting but you may see
ballots already in those are those in
those early votes and those absentee
votes again
in most cases those will be the very
first ones counted it's intuitive
why the bipartisan teams that are still
tearing down the polling locations
haven't even loaded up in the car to
bring them down to the board of
elections yet
but right at 7 31 they begin with those
early and absentee voting but
as far as when you look at those county
numbers and sort of being able to parse
out these are
provisional or these are absentees and
these are in person you won't be able to
do that with the
with the sort of unofficial election
night results as they're accumulating
but again the the final reports will
definitely give you that
that level of granular detail okay thank
you thank you
yes ma'am um we
i know you had a question about curbside
voting
we've been hearing in franklin county in
particular that a lack of signage
is an issue and that there are some
polling locations where curbside
voting is not available have you
secretary
heard anything specific to franklin
county and what might be done about that
no haven't but as soon as i walk back
over to the office that'll be one of the
first calls that we make in fact
probably a member of my team is texting
our election operations room right now
about that
as far as signage goes this was
something that we actually did this year
as well though that's worth pointing out
we used some of the the dollars that
became available to us to to purchase
standardized signage for the whole state
so if you go out to a polling location
you'll see sort of the a-frame or what i
call a sandwich board sign
that lists not only the the covet
accommodations
but also the fact that there's curbside
voting available you also see yard signs
just sort of these coroplast
yard signs that can go in the flower bed
or in the grass leading up
that remind people to wear a mask
maintain distance and also of the
available
availability of curbside voting now
here's what i didn't do i didn't
micromanage how each county was going to
do curbside voting because
88 different counties a very diverse
state i wanted to allow the boards of
elections some flexibility because it is
logistically challenging when you're
running a polling location you may have
a line of people
to sort of take people and send them
outside with the clipboard and the right
ppe to do the curbside voting
but many counties though they they put
placed a phone number on those
choroplast signs or on those
a-frame signs we built them to
accommodate that and it says call this
number
and let's be honest most of us have a
mobile phone not everybody does but
call this number if you want to access
curbside voting there's also the
traditional way
which again curbside voting has been
available for decades long before any of
us ever had a cell phone
uh and and in those days the way you
would simply do it is flag down a fellow
voter
sort of yell out the window hey i need
the curbside vote would you tell the
poll workers inside it's a
you know it's not the most uh fancy way
to do it but it works and especially
with a presidential election with a
pretty
you know steady flow uh coming and going
uh that that methodology works to alert
the team inside that you need to
curbside but some county boards of
elections actually had volunteers like
boy scouts and girl scouts and 4-h
members and that kind of thing standing
outside
spotting for curbside voters as well so
are there regulations as to where those
signs have to be
to make that that they're visible not
regulations but suggestions of course
common sense supplies again with four
close to four thousand polling locations
they are
very different there are urban locations
where the the building comes right up to
the sidewalk and then right up to the
street
there are locations that are in a huge
parking lot there are locations that are
you know
way out in a rural area i mean every
sort of everything you can imagine
if you go to these different polling
locations have been to a lot of them
that are on fairgrounds for example or
whatever else so
what we've given is guidance that it
should be visible
between where people park or get off a
bus so where people sort of first access
the site and the door
that's where we wanted to place those
signs so it's visible from the parking
area
right but also visible for those as
they're walking in again that's the
guidance we've given them
we're not we can't i mean it's just
logistically impossible to micromanage
exactly where to place those signs
though thank you
yes ma'am yeah other questions yeah
adrian we continue to get reports of
longer lines i know you've touched on
this a little bit
obviously with technical issues these
lines are getting longer
what's your recommendation to voters as
we get closer and closer to that time
that polls are closing
if they are waiting in an extreme long
line
well a couple things about lines first
of all it's important for people to
understand
that when a line is socially distanced
it's going to look longer than it really
is again
in some places there are legitimately
you know lines that are taking a little
bit of time
but a six foot social distance line
looks a lot longer than we're accustomed
to normally people stand about 18 inches
apart nobody would be doing that today
um and so don't be dis don't be
discouraged if you show up and see a
line that looks long it may
be moving a lot faster in fact this is
one of the things where we got advice
from cedar point the amusement park
company
that was part of our ready for november
task force these zoom meetings that many
of you watched us do
that was broadcast on the ohio channel
and thanks by the way to our team from
the ohio channel for doing that
and for doing this today um the the
amusement park folks reminded us of a
method that they use
and we've all been there in line at the
at the amusement park where it says
you'll be on the ride in 20 minutes or
whatever else that's reassuring right
because
otherwise people might lose lose hope
and so what we've told the boards of
elections to do is to play signage if
they can or
if nothing else send a poll worker out
there to walk the line every now and
then to
to check in with people to remind them
that they'll be inside within 20 or 30
minutes to give them that reasonable
expectation
the other thing is don't wait right it's
the middle of the afternoon right now if
your
if your schedule if your work schedule
if your family schedule and school
schedule allows it
uh get out to the polling location as
soon as you can we're in a traditionally
slower period
or in the mid middle afternoon there
tends to be an increase
right after work and so you know beat
that rush by getting out there right now
uh to cast your ballot and certainly
anybody who's in line
will not be turned away of course dress
appropriately um
you know dress for the elements and that
kind of thing although it's a beautiful
day out there
just a little bit windy and a little bit
chilly but you know be ready to stand in
an outdoor line
and let's be kind to one another let's
be patient to one another if there's an
elderly person
try to help them to the front of the
line somebody with mobility challenges
try to help them let them get to the
front you know just
reasonable common sense the things that
ohioans do because
we're kind and patient people and and
tend to treat each other with respect
yeah well i appreciate it everybody
thank you so much for the work that you
do let me let me mention that i mean the
the founders could have never imagined
the situation that we're finding finding
ourselves in running an election in the
midst of a pandemic and all the other
things but
they did know that an informed
electorate was necessary
for a functioning democracy and so they
created the very first amendment to
protect the work that you all do and i
for one appreciate it so thank you for
keeping ohioans informed with accurate
information throughout the day
and throughout the evening and at 7 30
tonight
when the polls close then the people of
ohio get to know
that their voice was heard and we will
respect that and report the results as
quickly as we can and make sure again
that every legally cast ballot
will be counted because again as lincoln
said the elections belong to the people
we're just the caretakers of that and
making sure that it runs honestly thank
you so much everybody
take care
