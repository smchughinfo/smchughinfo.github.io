we move on to the ohio book awards
first given in 1942 the ohio net book
awards
are the second oldest state literary
prize
in america only the california book
awards are older
more than 500 books by ohioans or about
ohio
have been honored since 1942 and tonight
we add
seven more titles to that distinguished
list
the awards are presented in seven
categories
we're going to begin with a category of
book
about ohio or an ohioan which is
sponsored by pnc bank
this is the only book award that could
be won by an author who is not
an ohioan so long as their subject
is ohio related and this year's winner
is david mccullough for the pioneers
unfortunately david could not join us
tonight
but he has asked a very special friend
to stand in for him
someone who is quite familiar to all
ohioans
a longtime legislator the 69th governor
of ohio
and may i add um and i know he won't
mind himself
a new york times best-selling author
former governor john kasich governor
kasich welcome
thank you well listen david i thank you
i
you know when the mccullough family
asked me if i might
step in and accept this award on uh on
david's behalf
uh this is like the greatest thing ever
right and you
you've known david mccullough for a long
time he wants you to know
how much he appreciates your friendship
uh
it's just it's an awesome opportunity
for me to be here
i want to thank martha cooper maybe
people don't know much about her but she
was the first lady of ohio and in 1929
she started this
right in the governor's mansion and then
uh
moved it into the i guess moved a couple
times into the building where you are
your organization is fabulous and i know
david that you spent time with my wife
when she was first lady and
we we so much believe in you and
and in reading and in studying and in
literary uh it's just wonderful
mccullough as you know
for those who don't know who he is
i think david he's i think he's
indispensable i don't think there is
i don't nobody's going to be able to
ever feel his shoes uh the things that
he has done
the book the pioneers of course if
you're in ohioan
and you want to learn about marietta and
you want to learn uh
about cincinnati and you want to learn
about zanesville
and uh this is the book you need to
read and it's the settling of the
northwest territory
and one of the things we can be most
proud of is he details in his book
the fact that that northwest territory
ohio
uh remained slave free uh
and david's report he is is just
see the thing about mccullough you have
to ask yourself how does he get all this
stuff because it's so brilliant
it's so detailed starting with the early
landing
uh in marietta and how they built the
settlement and all the things that they
went through
it's a fascinating book but we as i
think you mentioned or somebody sent in
some notes
one of my favorite books and i love
pioneers but one of my favorite books is
the wright brothers
yes for those that have not read the
wright brothers you've got to get it
in fact my wife and i were just heading
down to dayton and i made sure that
we pulled over and stopped to see that
that
area where the wright brothers had flown
the plane it was always amazing to me
as the wright brothers were flying that
plane the dayton daily news couldn't
figure out how to get to the edge of
town and watch them
bring birth flight and all this business
about north carolina and
you know the land of flight all they had
was the sand dunes and a little wind all
the work was done
in ohio but i'm just going to suggest to
all of you here the wright brothers
unbelievable the johnstown flood david i
don't know if you've ever read that
it's another remarkable story that um it
sheds light
on sometimes the power of people who
have wealth
and uh and and how they proceeded in
terms of the
of the efforts they made along the
johnstown
that created the problems around the
johnston flood i am just
currently almost 500 pages into the book
on john adams
and what i learned and this is why ohio
ann is so important this award so
important
is in reading through that book i we
talk about how divided we are as a
country today
go back and read that book about uh what
was happening at the
at the end of the seventh or the 18th
century
and uh i'm sorry to get that wrong i
guess
like i'm saying the 17th century david
was uh
was an unbelievable period the division
the fighting
just absolutely uh remarkable his book
about the panama canal harry truman the
brooklyn bridge
all that is great but none of them are
as great
as the pioneers and the wright brothers
two
stories that really highlight the
greatness of ohio and how we were
leaders
in this country uh when you read his
book you say i
no idea how he put all this together and
one of the things that i know the the
mccullough family wanted to point out
is uh wanted to thank the staff at
marietta college
library especially linda showalter
head of the special collections
department at the legacy library
who provided him with a treasure trove
of original archival material
to chronicle the lives of the central
characters in the pioneers
and those were of course manassa and
ephraim cutler
and the indomitable rufus putman which
is an
amazing man the staffs of the campus
martius museum in marietta
and the ohio history connection in
columbus ohio
both of which provided him and his
research assistant
mike hill amazing amazing and valuable
research
that allowed him to put this book
together uh i wish he was here
uh i thought so much of him david i met
him once in boston where he sang a
little song and did a little dance
which was as delightful as anything but
then i had him come to the cabinet
and address the cabinet when he was
honored at the ohio state house
just a fabulous guy unlike anybody else
almost without a peer and i think he
would so deeply appreciate this award
and i know his family does
and i couldn't be more grateful for the
opportunity
to say some good things about him and
about the work that you david
and the whole team are doing to promote
uh
reading and uh and all forms of literary
work
so thank you and god bless us huh all of
us thank you
thank you thank you john and uh and and
david did say to be sure and thank you
um for taking the time to represent him
tonight and
uh and so i know that they were thrilled
when you said yes
and i want to say a personal thank you
to you um for you and karen and all the
support you gave ohio and
in the eight years that you were um in
in office so thanks so much
best of luck to you i know you've got a
busy fall ahead i i
see you periodically on cnn with don
lemon so
i'll look forward to seeing you there
again i'm sure soon so
david one final thing i think we all
have to always realize how important the
arts are
in the great state of ohio and in our
country and so
uh regardless of what happens in
politics and budgets there always has to
be room for the arts
uh they're the civilizing factor in our
culture and society today
thank you david and god bless all the
winners here thank you governor thank
you very much
all right thank you all well what a way
to kick off the book awards so
um thank you once again and
congratulations to uh
to david mccullough i i might point out
david mccullough
is the first ever two-time winner of the
ohio book award in the category
a book about ohio or highland his last
victory
was for the wright brothers in 2016 so
um so two ohio ohioan book awards uh for
him along with two
national book awards and two pulitzer
prizes and a slew of other awards so
congratulations
to david mccullar we're sorry he could
not be here
so now we're going to move on to the
reader's choice award which is
the newest of our book awards it was
created for our 75th anniversary of the
ohio book awards in 2016
and this award gives readers the chance
to vote online for their favorite book
from among
all of the finalists in all six
categories so
this year's runaway choice i have to say
of readers
was ken goffman um who won for his book
a season
on the wind and introducing ken will be
ohio and his board president
john sullivan who was also an attorney
for
our event sponsor honda so welcome john
thank you david a season on the win
takes a close look at one
season and one key site along lake erie
and northwestern ohio
in doing that it reveals the amazing
science and magic of spring bird
migration
and the perils of human encroachment the
author
ken kaufman is the originator of the
kaufman field guide series
and one of the world's foremost
naturalists congratulations ken
well thank you very much i'm i'm honored
to be here it's a
sort of a heady challenge to be
following david mccullough and john
kasich
i just want to say as john sullivan was
saying
you know the migration of birds is a
phenomenon that's really massive in
scale
every spring and fall there are billions
of birds moving across the face of the
globe
and some of them are traveling thousands
of miles and they can navigate with
pinpoint accuracy
a little songbird weighing less than an
ounce can leave its nesting territory in
canada and fly to brazil in the fall
and then the following spring come back
and find its way back to the very same
tree
that it left the previous year it's just
to me it all seems like a miracle and
the more i study the science
of it the more i'm filled with a sense
of wonder about it all
i'm lucky to live in one of the best
places in the world to witness the
spring migration
every every spring vast numbers of small
birds coming north from the tropics
reach the edge of lake erie and
northwestern ohio and then they pause
to like think about it and rest and feed
and gets
get ready for the next flight going on
north into canada
and so these huge concentrations of
little birds build up
uh and it creates a spectacle that
attracts bird watchers from all over the
world
i mean seriously you can you can talk to
bird watchers in
england or south africa or australia and
you'll mention mcgee marsh and they know
all about it they've you know they a lot
of them have been here
but to me it's uh it's just as important
that the local community has
embraced this and you know from toledo
to sandusky to fremont to
findlay um everyone is aware of this
spring arrival
of birds and bird watchers and they're
aware of this thing that we call the
biggest week in american birding
and to me that that's the best thing
about it and i think that may
explain why uh why a book about bird
migration could win a uh
a reader's choice award um it's
um you know
right now obviously we're going through
some really challenging times in this
country but
even when things seem hopeless you can
find reassurance by
by going outside or even looking out the
window and paying attention to
birds and nature it's um
you know winter is coming on and and
everything might seem dark for a while
but there are birds out there even in
the depths of winter
and before the end of february the
spring migration will be beginning
there will be red wing blackbirds moving
north across the landscape
and other birds horn larks and things
then in march there will be flocks of
ducks and
the cardinals will be starting to tune
up and robins will reappear in yards
where
they haven't been seen for many weeks
and it's all like a promise that
that spring is coming back so you know
no matter what's happening
in human society if we pay attention to
the birds they will be following the
same rhythms that they've followed for
ages
and i think you know whether or not you
decide to read my book i hope you'll
think about paying attention to the
birds and just
seeing about the ways that they can
bring comfort
and reassurance into your life so thank
you so much to the
ohioana library association i'm i'm just
so honored
and all my bird watching friends uh are
honored
and the black swamp bird observatory
which was the source for the information
we're all just so appreciative to you
you are quite welcome
again and and we were honored and
thrilled and so congratulations to you
um i have to say i think one of the
reasons why
we had a larger number of votes for you
than anybody
in the five-year history of this award
and i said it must be all the bird
watchers
across the country so they all came out
in force for you
and and we're just thrilled you know to
um share this honor with you and and i
want to thank you again and thank john
sullivan and thank honda
so um okay on now to

congratulations okay thanks
hi okay hello everyone
i hope everyone can hear me okay am i
you can hear me
wonderful i want to first thank you
melia so much for
introducing me so beautifully
unfortunately we all can't be together
in in ohio in order to celebrate
my fellow amazing talented winners
as well um i
am author and illustrator and my book is
saturday
and it's about a mom and a daughter
named ava
and the mom works uh monday tuesday
wednesday thursday friday
and saturday is the day that they spend
together
they have some big plans for their
saturday but as we know
in life and as we know because of
quarantine
things don't always go as planned but i
think the real
special thing about this book is not
that their plans go awry but how they
react
and they always react with positivity
and they keep pushing forward
and they focus on what matters is that
they're there
together i know that right now we are
all going through
some very very stressful troubling times
and it can feel like the problems that
we have in front of us are just
big that they just they're so big they
can overwhelm us
at times and i think something
that the thing i love the most about
collage
because i'm a collage artist is i love
that
collage is a medium in which i get to
take
small little scraps of paper that you
have around
things we overlook all the time things
that we don't really think have much
worth
and i get to put them on the page and i
get to reveal
all the magic that's within them and it
makes me think of what are the other
things that are in my life that i'm
overlooking what are these other things
that are present in our day that we
think are small we think are
ordinary and think they're things that
aren't very important
but when we really think about those
things those are everything
and sometimes it's just a kind word from
someone sometimes
it's just a hug sometimes it's just a
hey
are you doing okay and sometimes as they
show in this book
it's stopping pausing and just taking a
deep breath
these small ordinary things can
really be everything and have power and
we should
never truly overlook them when i first
read this wrote this book
i thought i was writing a book about
time you know they don't
then how time is this interesting kind
of construct but
the more and more i thought of it and as
i was working on this book and
as i got a chance to interact with
readers and hear their stories
i realized i had written a book about
love
and when i think about love and i think
about
the love that's been given to me so much
of it has originated
here in ohio it's from the
local library that i grew up by where
all the librarians knew my name and
always recommended me books
from the king arts complex where i
learned about so many magnificent
um columbus-based artists like elijah
pierce and amina robinson
it's from my local church it's from my
family
my friends i
want to thank ohio from the bottom of my
heart for all the love you gave me
growing up
and continue to give me and how this
state has supported my career
because at some point i just came so
overwhelmed with it i just had to spill
it on the page and
that's how we get books like saturday
and so i'd like to just
thank my family and obie iffy
abella oiny bulsa adora
and chica my siblings and my parents and
most particularly my mom
for making this book possible thank you
so much everyone
thank you okay and congratulations once
again and
and thank you malia wolf and and thank
you cover to cover

very
close and special relationship with you

um you were the first people that said

david saying that i had received the
marvin grant and

slept and like
into the morning i had been working on
my manuscript i had like printed it out
and cut it apart and was rearranging
pieces and i was just really losing
confidence in it so getting that early
support from

and writers at the new york public
library
on behalf of the voorhees law firm and
the ohioana board
congratulations salvatore
thanks very much um thanks to everyone
who's made this
possible over almost 80 years
and congratulations to the other writers
here
i also owe a debt of thanks and an
apology
to the dedicated staff that ran the
strongsville branch of the
cuyahoga county public library between
1978 and 1993 when i lived there
i knew i wasn't supposed to write in the
margins of your books
but they were about the only books i had
access to at the time
and evidently i was desperate to write
on something
i'm speaking to you now from brooklyn
new york
my first home as chance would have it
was brooklyn ohio
seven of my great-grandparents
immigrated to greater cleveland and they
all died there
all my grandparents were born and died
in greater cleveland
i grew up there and my whole family
still lives there
it's an unfair advantage for a fiction
writer to grow up in the same place as
his parents and grandparents
nothing in your hometown is merely what
you see now
but is also by way of family gossip
what it was 30 years ago and 30 years
before that
you get used to seeing the narrative
inside of things
the way life accumulates generation by
generation in a place
and often the way people carry around a
phantom version
of their first homes wherever they go
for example when i was a graduate
student at the university of iowa i
lived a quarter mile south
of the old capitol building at the
center of town
that is i believed it was south in fact
it was due east
i could never get my bearings the sun
always seemed to rise in the wrong place
where did this delusion come from after
about a year of living there i realized
that having grown up south of downtown
cleveland
i considered north the direction toward
the center of the big city
no evidence to the contrary has ever
been quite persuasive
the place you come from sets your
compass and to some degree
it freezes there so i'm grateful to
think that your association regards this
book which takes place
in iowa vietnam new york new mexico and
germany
has a piece of ohioana which inevitably
it is
thank you thank you salvatore and
and uh thanks to dan and devores
congratulations to all of the 2020 book
award winners
and to brendan curtin rich and thanks to
all of our sponsors
and presenters so now with the awards
having been presented this would
normally be the point where if we were
at the state house
the authors would be moving over to a
table and signing copies of their books
so but since we are not doing that we
thought it would be fun to have a round
table so that we could hear the authors
talking about their creative
inspiration their writing process and
whatever else might come to their mind
and to moderate our panel we're
delighted to welcome back a long time
friend linda fagler
who was the longtime senior editor at
ohio magazine
and a pastor hyman a board member and
while
linda will be leading the discussion one
of the great things about being
virtual is that everyone out there in
the audience can also
ask questions of the panelists
simply use and i hope i'm right on this
somebody correct me if i'm wrong the
chat function
on the lower part of your screen which
you can submit your question and we'll
do our best to take as many as we can
um so linda and all of our authors
and writers take it away
linda
linda has frozen on me
linda fagler i don't know how to reach
her
somebody um morgan or courtney or
somebody who's our technical people if
they can
reach linda pigler so but in any case
well i'm go i'll start the i'll start
the discussion off because one book
or one thing that i always like to know
about every author because
our our thing is every
writer is first a reader
so when you were a young reader was
there one particular book or one
particular author
who inspired you so so who was your
creative muse
salvatorius cabona since you were a last
award winner speaker so we'll have you
start off in reverse
i i really loved a book called um
i didn't read very much as a little boy
as i started reading in high school
i loved um a prayer for owen meany by
john irving
i remember once for the first time in my
life i read for about three
hours without stopping and i can still
remember
coming downstairs to get a glass of
water and i
was narrating in my mind in complete
sentences
what i was doing as i was doing it and i
had never had an experience anything
like that before
the language had gotten into into my
you know neural processing um and i was
hooked
excellent uh linda figler yeah they had
a connection for you know technology is
great when it works so thank you
well i started off i just asked a
question and salvador was the first to
respond
all right great we're off to a good
start was there one particular book or
author when you were young
that was your creative muse that made
you say
by golly that's what i want to do so so
salvatore was the first person
okay let's start with that question
that's a great question david how about
everyone joining with that
and sharing their their favorite authors
anybody want to start
i guess i'll i'll just follow sure
absolutely
i i think i'll stay to picture books
um i think two picture books actually
come to mind really
one picture book in one illustrator
comes to mind
um my favorite picture book of all time
is tar beach by faith wrinkled
i particularly loved that book um
i i related a lot to the little girl in
the book she grew up in the city i grew
up in the city
and i just liked this idea this little
girl could fly across the sky
i'm also a very big fan of sadly he
passed away this year
tommy de paula
thank you ken kaufman i i was wondering
if maybe
maybe your favorite book as a as a young
reader was daphne du maurier's the birds
[Laughter]
well i was i was a voracious reader um
as a kid i read you know science fiction
and history and biographies and things
but in terms of uh
nature writing um books by roger tory
peterson were the ones that i actually
memorized the ones where i got to the
stage where i could recite entire
chapters and
so later i got to know peterson in
person and he
he told me he thought i was a good
writer because i you know i sort of
copied his style
that must be great you know to have
somebody that you admired as a writer
tell you that he likes your writing so
how about you jasmine warga yeah
i um remember as a kid loving so many
different stories particularly middle
grade novels which i think it's no
surprise then
they ended up there everything from
charlotte's web to the bunch of
sort of imprinted on me uh but i want to
give a special shout out to
an ohio writer uh margaret peterson
haddocks who wrote a book called running
out of time
um that we were assigned when i was in
grade school and that book
absolutely captivated me i lived in that
world and
i remember getting to meet um margaret a
few years ago and
having a freak out because i mean at
this point i'd met lots of other writers
but
that seemed so wild um that this
person who had written this book um that
i kept feeding me as a child was
a living breathing writer still working
in ohio so i think that's really cool
brendan
yes um um
names that come to my mind um
mary pope osborne was the writer who
kind of flipped the switch when i was
really young and then
gene craighead george my side of the
mountain
was really influential when i was when i
was young we read that in class in
fourth grade and that
really stayed with me for a long time
and then eventually
as i got older i graduated to really
uh enjoy and admire the writings of
another ohio writer ian frazier
and his essays that he's published
fabulous and last but not least jeannie
vanessco i mean you've written mostly
memoir but is that what you read
as a young reader no i mean
well i read i was always interested in
books i wasn't supposed to read
so my i remember going to the library we
went to the local library all the time
and my dad was often reading i wondered
what he was reading he was
um always uh fascinated by these books
um and they were always about the mafia
so i was like in the first and second
grade
uh reading books about the mob
um just because i wanted to i don't know
like
if he was interested in it i wanted to
be interested in it
um but the other another book though a
children's book a more age-appropriate
book for me at that time
would have been the story i'm sure a lot
of you know it i don't know who the
original author would have been but it
was the story of the girl who wore a
ribbon around her neck
and you and like you don't know why she
won't take the ribbon
off and does anyone know this
no oh okay there's this great writer
carmen maria machado did a retelling of
this story in her story collection
uh her body and other parties but the
whole it's a children's book the whole
book like this girl has a ribbon around
her neck
and at the end you discover like spoiler
the reason why
is like she um she takes the ribbon off
and her head falls off
and that just like blew my mind in
kindergarten like i thought that was the
coolest thing and that you could just do
that
in writing so yeah mafia biographies and
then the
i guess like you'd be related and the uh
the girl with the ribbon
excellent great answers thank you all
for responding so so linda let's hope
you staying frozen here
i know i know and you can you can call
on our authors david
could you all talk a little bit about
the inspiration behind your latest works
anybody can start brendan you want to
start
yeah um i can give it a shot so i just i
just finished up my
mfa at iowa state university so um
my thesis my body of work that i've just
i just created for my thesis
is i think the freshest um
on my mind um
and gosh some of the books that i was
reading
while i was composing that that i was
trying to emulate
probably a little bit of ian fraser who
i mentioned before um
and his non-fiction essays just his
inquisitiveness and his
um his ability to just kind of sit in
place and luxuriate in the details of
of a setting um he has this
this great essay um
about canal street in new york city um
and the the descriptions and details are
just so rich
um in that essay um
john mcphee um his book
um particularly coming into the country
um
a lot of nonfiction work um
i think has has been kind of like at the
forefront of my mind
in the essays that i've been writing
most recently um
yeah i think i don't know okay
thank you who would like to go next
genie want to try
sure i'll try okay um so i would say
actually the inspiration for my second
book would have been
though it had been around for a while
but the increased attention to the metoo
movement
uh so i was
at the height of the me too movement i
want to say it was like after
the fall it was the month that my first
book came out
and i was getting asked a lot of
questions about this very short scene in
my first book
where sexual assault happens and i just
kind of go past it and i didn't think
anything of it but so many people at
bookstores were asking me
about it and i got to thinking about why
i hadn't included it in my first book
and that i thought it made
it made things uneven or it was
inconvenient on a craft level
and i'm interested a lot of times in the
stuff that makes
writing inconvenient especially in
memoir i like to think of facts
as formal constraints or facts as well
as i you know
know them and i got to thinking about
this
sexual assault and had been by one of my
closest friends growing up
and i thought i wonder if he still
thinks about it so
i reached out to him and asked him if he
would go
on the record and answer my questions
about this
um this event that happened back in uh
like it would have been 14 years prior
and he agreed because he had felt
guilty all these years and um
and so him saying yes really got me to
investigate larger questions
about like is it possible to be a good
person who commits a terrible act
and what does forgiveness look like and
what does punishment look like
and restorative justice so i'd say um
the increased attention on the metoo
movement
definitely inspired me okay thank you
jasmine how about you
yeah so all of my books they tend to
start with a question
that i have about the world or about our
society and
this book in particular started um with
this question of
i was trying to figure out why so many
people
um in this country seemed afraid of
these children who are fleeing from a
war zone
and then i started to dig deeper into
sort of what it means to be
a muslim american what it means to be an
arab american and this particular
moment in america and then
kind of branching out from there this
question of how do i write
a book about the universality though of
being 12 about
showing um that these kids who
probably have very different journey and
lives than
say a child growing up in suburban ohio
at the end of the day
um the interiority of their thoughts and
dreams
um there's a lot of commonalities so i
guess all of those questions kind of
um culminated into
wanting to write um other words for home
and sort of wanting to see
a book that i thought was empowering
um in terms of the refugee experience as
opposed to
um being so wrought
um with with trauma which obviously um
there's a lot of difficulties in jude's
journey but there's also
a lot of joy and that was really
important to me
okay who would like to go next i don't
want to call on you guys so just jump in
um i guess i think
it's kind of interesting you'll be an
artist is that i think a lot of times we
joke about how
we want to kind of sit in the studio in
order to kind of think of our ideas but
all the ideas happen when you turn the
lights off and you
leave the studio and you just go out and
experience life
you know i'm definitely i mean i think
about
introvert or extra i definitely am on
the extroverted kind of side
and i love talking to people and i love
interacting with people and connecting
with people
and i find more people i connect with
and interact with i
they'll just be ideas that will come to
mind i'll run into a little girl and
i'll be really fascinated by her
really cool pattern leggings and
suddenly a little girl with patterned
leggings shows up in my
books like i'll have a conversation with
my sister and i'll be like oh then that
should be kind of added in there
i think what's just really cool about
being an artist is just
staying open to those kind of moments of
inspiration where it hits you every
single day
great thanks next
okay um well it's it's easy for me to
to say because my my latest book was
about the spring migration here in
northwestern ohio
and after living through it year after
year
you get these days in in late april when
it seems like things have been stuck
for a while and you know the trees
aren't really leafing out and the birds
haven't really arrived and you're
waiting and looking at the weather
patterns
day after day and then there's this
glorious day when everything comes
piling in
their south winds overnight and you go
out in the morning and there are all
these little birds all over the trees
these
colorful warblers that just spent the
winter in south america and it's like
you know it's like resurrection it's
like you've been born again and here's
all this variety and abundance of life
and
you know i i didn't really start writing
the book until i reached the point where
there was no way i could stop myself
from writing it it was just it was
something i had to do
it seems like the time because you've
helped us so many times at ohio magazine
with quite wildlife questions we have
but this seemed like a time feeder this
is something a little different
for you isn't it it's more of a personal
journey yeah it was just sort of the
i was trying to describe the science but
more so describe the magic of it and
just the emotional response
thank you next yeah um
i i sympathize a lot with what jasmine
said about starting with a question
um i had um uh
and also what olga said about about
about the idea coming the moment you
stop writing you know you
you you have the perfect place to work
and then it comes to you
the moment you close the door but um i
was
i was in um i was staying in latvia for
a while
and um and then was visiting um
my german publisher in hamburg on the
way back
i had um about six or seven euros left
in my pocket i was going back to latvia
and latvia was not on the euro at the
time i just hate having money that i
can't spend you know so i i got
in line to get into my flight and there
was a um
i was just going to ask the guy at the
desk how much it cost to buy martini on
this plane
because i thought that would be the
perfect way of blowing my last euros but
it would be so infuriating if the
martini cost eight euros
and i'd be stuck with this money so um
and i had nothing else to do
so meantime as i was waiting there was a
child in front of me
who uh in two or two he was about four
or five years old
and he was crying in this really
controlled but
clearly really terrified way and the
flight attendant and uh
and his mother were trying were sort of
bent down trying to calm him down
and then the woman i took to be his
mother went and sat in the seats
and talked to somebody else and i
realized she wasn't the mother at all
she was just trying to help
then the woman from the airline took the
kid away
he's crying continually the whole time
10 or 15 minutes it takes about 10 to 15
more minutes for me to get to the front
of the line
and i asked the guy at the desk how much
does it cost by martini on this plane
and he said i don't know i said
you have no idea that i don't work for
this airline this is a this is a latvian
airline they
they have one flight into this airport i
worked for the airport
and i said oh damn what was the matter
with that kid
and just as he said that the woman who
had taken the kid away
brought him back around the corner and
he was crying just the same way
for half an hour he was crying the
entire time
and he said nobody can figure out what
language he's speaking
oh wow he was he it
as it turned out over over time over the
next half hour so
it became pretty obvious that someone
had left him there
on purpose and i i other people did the
best thing that we could we were like
sort of pelting him with different
languages
trying to figure out that someone think
was sure that he was estonian
but whatever language he started
speaking at the beginning was very
obscure nobody understood it and then he
just stopped talking all together
so eventually i followed them down to
the end of the secure area of the
airport
and she took him through the door
the door closed and i never saw him
again
um when i finally got on the plane it
was every everybody was i mean for
an hour on the flight every everybody
had seen this happen
and the whole room the whole airplane
was full of people who were just sick
with
terror like on on behalf of this child
and none of us could ever as far as i
know ever find out
so my book is uh it was about 10 years
of writing the book was
how did that boy get there um and so it
goes back to vietnam
uh my answer is that he's the he's
goes to his father his father's left him
there and his father
is a vietnam veteran who's who becomes
the main character of the book the
volunteer
so just with you jasmine about like
having a question and if you you know
the writer really wants to know
something that's
that's the fuel that makes the book go
wow
thank you for sharing that anyone else
i think that was all of us all of you
okay
okay can you talk about what the is what
the writing process is like for each of
you
you can just jump in
and we'll start with brendan again i
shouldn't do call on you but
why don't you lead us off and then just
no problem um yeah i'm i'm kind of
in a transitional phase with my writing
um
you know just leaving um school
where i was working really closely with
professors and with um
colleagues in the mfa program um you
know where i was i was in kind of this
structured environment where
i was completing assignments um
that were you know mandated in either
length or topic
or subject and so
i'm kind of wondering that same question
for myself right now is
what does the creative process look for
me now now that i'm
kind of um writing independently
and not in a system anymore um
and i think that um just curiosity is
really fundamental to that um that's
what that's that's kind of the seed that
every
essay and every short story and every um
piece of writing kind of blooms
out of um
is what what piques your interest and
what um
what kind of ideas are you willing to
chase um one of my
one of my professors at hiram college
mary quaid who
um has been really influential um
in my writing career uh once in class
said um the hardest thing for a young
writer is
knowing um is knowing when your wild
hair is a good wild hair and that you
should chase it
um and so
i think that that's the start of the
creative process for everyone is is
seeing that
wild hair so to speak and deciding to
chase it
um and following it down it's rabbit
hole if that's
where it leads um and so that's that's
i think probably my favorite metaphor
for the creative process is that um
you just get into the weeds um and start
searching around until you find
um you start everything starts to make
sense and coalesce around the project
that you're working on
beyond that like i said it's
being independently accountable to
myself now is i'm still laying the
framework for that
in terms of actually producing producing
work
um but
i think that it's it's just like a
lifelong learning and growing process
okay anybody want to jump in next uh
maybe i'll jump in
okay um
i i will be honest um
writing for me is so stressful i like
finishing it rather than the actual
process of doing it
it stresses me out um i wish i could say
more romantic things about that process
but
you're a kindred soul dorothy parker
once said i hate to write i love to have
written
and that's pretty i can understand that
that
is really well i think the thing that
helps me the most and
i do this the same way whenever i'm
drawing whenever i like i don't really
know what idea i'm trying to do
i just sketch a bunch and i do a lot of
really fast sketches and i just keep
going and going and going and going
and i like just doing producing a lot
because i find when you start to produce
a lot of stories or release a lot of
drawings
you get less precious about things you
let you
over think less and you just kind of try
to put ideas down
and so a lot of the stuff that you'll
put down
isn't really much of anything but then
at least you can kind of go back and
look and you're like oh no something's
here something's there
and then you draw some more and you draw
some more and draw some more and so
usually because i find writing so
stressful that is my approach to writing
and so
before i did saturday i think i had just
i would just do multiple children's book
stories a week
and just do as many as i could and then
kind of and the interesting thing that
kind of happened was
all the stories that i had written i
kind of just like threw away
but i was glad that i wrote them because
i started to see
things that i was doing like i think the
big things particularly in picture books
when you're writing for children
is not to try to lecture children
or get too involved in whatever message
or thing you have on your heart
but really think about what's going to
make a kid smile what
that's really going to entertain them
and so i think
the more and more you write and you just
kind of produce a lot
you just get freer you get less in your
head
and you kind of enter into more of like
a childlike mindset and
create a story so that's what i hope
always happens
thank you it has yes it makes me that
reminds me of a great moment in
the annie dillard book the writing life
i don't know if you've ever read that
but she has a similar advice as what is
what you were saying
that um you you can't save anything you
have to spend
everything all of it right now the
moment you
the moment the idea comes to you she
said the great line is like
the impulse to save an interesting
thing for later should be the cue to
spend it now
because if everything that you save when
you go back to it
it's it's gone to ash right i have
actually never
written i've never read that book but
um a fellow illustrator of mine sophie
mccall uh
loves that quote and so it's actually on
my wall no no kidding
oh it's right there
[Laughter]
so i would definitely agree with that
great
that's great how about you ken
yeah well i i still haven't developed an
actual process for writing
um i know i'll have to do that
eventually um
the one thing i can say is that i've
never written anything where i started
at the beginning
and wrote through to the end i always
start like somewhere in the middle and
put pieces together
and i i probably should have an outline
but i don't do an outline until i've got
most of it
and then i sort of go back and and do it
after the fact and
outline what i've got because you know
if you're going to send off a proposal
to an agent or publisher
you need to have like the outline of it
but it it happens later so
um ideas just come to me and i'll
scribble things down on index cards
while i'm out walking around in the
woods or something and
gradually all the pieces come together
so
all i can say is that if anyone really
wants to be a writer they shouldn't
follow my example
ah genie how about you
i feel like so much of the process when
i'm when i'm stuck it's like
looking into the refrigerator just
thinking maybe the answers are just
staring right or staring at the wall um
i just think so much of pro the writing
process is thinking
uh and i don't know with like both of my
books the process was very different
where the first one it was very much in
collage
mode and i think that's because it
started as poetry shifted to fiction
went to non-fiction i was trying out
different genres in different forms
and where i would i like to print my
manuscript single side well you can see
on my my binders i use those for
different projects
um i like to print things single sided
and then
you know put them in a binder but cut
them apart and rearrange and sometimes
look for artful juxtapositions or cut a
paragraph
up and look for opportunities to deepen
um but then the second book
wasn't very collaging it was more um
it was more methodical and moving i
thought i was writing slowly
where i was going sentence by sentence
which was very unusual for me
but it actually not to say we should
value speed it seems like such an
american thing of like
productivity but it did go a lot more
quickly for me because i was
i wrote a sentence and i would think
okay looking back like what comes next
and sounds so basic
but it really helped me see it through
and but i i think like the pr it changes
project to project it depends what the
demands are what the questions are
and i i think um it's at the start of
the project
and the very end of one when i need the
most discipline you know when it's like
okay get up at 4am or 5am and
don't check the news don't you know just
just start writing
uh but when i'm in the middle of a
project that's the best
part because you're forming connections
constantly suddenly everything
becomes potential material
or potential answers to a problem that
you're facing so
so yeah i think it just it just depends
on
i feel like each time like now i'm back
in that period that's why the award is
so nice it gives you a renewed sense of
confidence
but like after each time i finish
something i'm like i'll never write
again i forget how to write how did i do
that
um and it's just it's also a lot of
patience i think that's another huge
part of the process
is being patient with yourself
okay and jasmine
yeah i agree with what everyone has
already said i think it's very similar
for me i'm sort of a
i guess every book i would say has a
different process because i have to
learn how to write
that particular book but on the
fundamentals that i think
kind of glue together for me are that
i'm a fumbler
and a collector and that i never quite
know
what the book is that i'm setting out to
write and so i sort of fumble through it
um but sort of like um okay you
mentioned that there's
a quality of fun to that and i try um to
keep that sort of quality of play and
fun because that's one of the things
that i love about writing is the
messiness of it and that i don't know
even though it's also the part that
makes me
feel um very frustrated often
so i think that so much of my writing
process is
letting ideas marinate so the characters
and the voice and the storyline
live with me for a long time and i'm
thinking about them when i'm driving
around or when i'm going to the grocery
store and then
slowly um i start to build those
connections but it's definitely
um like a messy long process that i
think is easy to romanticize
uh once i finished a book to look back
and see all the
moments that i enjoyed when things
clicked and sort of uh forget about
all the moments that i wanted to give up
on the book
and um so i think that that's what i
have to remind myself of
every time that i start again that um
that it wasn't always like just fun and
joy with
the book that uh was completed it would
be painful yes if anyone wants to ask
questions you know please type them in
the chat
room there hit chat and do it and we'll
answer them
what did you learn about what did you
learn while writing
this book talk about that process did
you learn anything anybody i'm not going
to call this time i'm not going to call
it because that's kind of a tough
question
anyway jump in
nobody's going to jump in i'm going to
have to call on people brandon
german adoption law um
very strange and the wonders will
translate
you could take happily i mean i had to
figure out
what exactly if a child is going into an
orphanage
what what what are the rules that govern
how the child gets out of the orphanage
and it being germany of course
there are rules and they're written down
and
i couldn't read german but i but google
translate could like turn
an entire book into something
approximating
english and that and a hundred thousand
other things i learned a lot about
how what was there where did the
research take you because that must have
been tough
your research where did that take you to
write this how did you did you do a lot
of research on the book
oh absolutely yeah i mean i i
in a hundred thousand places i mean i
talked to my dad uh a lot about um
the part of a good part of the book
takes place at the siege of caisson
and um uh and uh this amazing moment
when um uh for him that he you know he
thought
he he just figured he was going to die
there because
he was um he was a marine
um uh basically hiding out um
for most of the time and didn't have any
idea the larger significance of
anything that was going on and they came
home and had a second tour of duty
then came home to stay and then seven or
eight years later he was
watching a video he was watching a
documentary on tv
and found out that it had been the
largest caisson had been
the largest aerial bombardment in the
history of warfare
i mean he was he was in the middle of
history
and only knew the tiniest little
part that was immediately surrounding
him he was an enlisted man
which was why he was like i mean he was
a just selfishly as a fiction writer
exactly the kind of source that you want
for a novel because
everything that he remembered he
remembered because it was real
not because it conformed with the larger
history that we would
you know not because historians would
later say that it was important
and it's those things that like i forget
who who coined this term but
while often what you're looking for is a
significant irrelevance
you know something that's something that
that it it
details chekhov is very good at this
like it's so
irresponsible to everything else that's
going on in the story that you believe
it absolutely and it becomes
the source of reality
thank you ken how about you
um yeah most of the books i've written
have been reference books
but the i mean the the latest one the
season on the wind has got
there is a lot of information and every
time i start in to write a book like
that
i sort of assume that i know the subject
really thoroughly but once you get into
it
you have to put it down in black and
white i started thinking well
you know so even though i'd read
you know dozens of books and thousands
of scientific papers about bird
migration before
i had to go in and reread or read all
the latest information because
you know there's new research being done
and new stuff coming out
and i had to learn a lot more about the
local geography in northwestern ohio
because i didn't know it as well as i
thought i did so
um it's always a learning project and
you know i feel like i know the subject
completely until i start to write it
down
ms moore how about you
what any thing you learned while writing
the book
did i pronounce your name wrong
yeah you're mute you're on mute oh
you're talking you said
maura so i was like how do you pronounce
your name i should i should have paid
attention
well my name is ogue okay okay and your
last name
your last name okay okay how about you
what did you learn about when writing
this book what did you learn about um
well i don't know if i've learned much
when
writing it but i think the really cool
thing about um
making artwork is you know part of the
the need to make artwork or make
collages is that you
you don't actually have the words for
what you're trying to convey
and you just kind of know you don't know
you don't know how to express it
like uh to someone but you you know
how it feels and so you that's what you
kind of like weave into all
of your work and so it's kind of nice
particularly when i think about my
artwork is
looking back at it and looking back at
it over time
and discovering new things within my
work and understanding more and
learning to kind of find the language
for what when i made it i didn't really
have the language for it yet
that's going to be challenging to find
the language to take words and really
translate them into pictures
is that a challenge um i think i
i guess i don't really think of it as
like translating
um words into pictures it's kind of
it's it's like like they're both like
you're you're kind of going back and
forth okay you know
um like i know a lot of author and
illustrators who
actually like make illustrations before
they like
write everything or some people kind of
go back and forth
but most part i like write before i
illustrate
but there's like a lot of like the
illustrations or things that you'll see
in my sketchbook
i was already kind of playing around
with particular things that were just
kind of stuck
particularly in my mind something that
was kind of interesting about book
like saturday is so much of saturday has
a musicality to it
and a lot of the characters positions it
kind of looks like they're dancing from
page to page
and i didn't plan this from
the beginning but that's the fun of
making artwork is
finding the surprises later on um
but i use a lot of old song books in the
collages
okay it was kind of interesting kind of
looking back
and seeing all the different ways that
i'm kind of creating a language within
the book
now do you use different materials for
your collages uh yeah
so yeah tell me how you choose the
materials and and what you use you saw
song books or one
what are some of the other favorites
newspapers
birthday cards paper i make myself
things i paint over sometimes i'll like
cut out pieces of paper
and i'll start kind of layering them on
top of each other and paint some more on
it and just use different kind of tools
and things like that
one of the things i love particularly
about collage is that it's just anything
goes
i think uh i was hilarious i was talking
to my
agent i think some weeks back and he
always kind of sends out cookies and
things like that and they come with like
this like little craft note um
and i just love this craft paper that it
comes with because most craft paper this
is like a weird artist thing but like
most craft paper has a very warm tone
most craft papers you see
but this craft paper has a slightly
cooler tone than most craft papers
and so like i really appreciated the
cookies and like the nice kind of
heartfelt note
but that definitely went into my paper
drawers and ended up flying into one of
my books and so
from like my my family and the people i
know know me very well where
i might be like oh thank you and unwrap
my gift and then like
keep the wrapping paper you know
it sounds like many times that's great
when i was still going to
schools like kids will like hear about
like my paper process
and so sometimes my gifts are um someone
gave me like some green paper from some
cake shop that like had a little
frosting on it but
i ended up using the paper but i get
lots of paper on
i used to get lots of paper on my
travels as well which is great that's
great when people see
somebody sending you paper that's great
people have it's kind of great
genie how about you what did you learn
while writing this book
gosh so much so much because i think it
um it goes back to jasmine had mentioned
you know starting with a question i
think so many questions were informing
my exploration um certainly it was
fascinating to me that
the changing definitions of sexual
assault
and rape and how that really shapes
one's
understanding of what happened to
oneself that was really interesting and
to see how it differs
state by state and then after the book
came out certainly talking
with readers about that and for them to
like
read a definition and realize oh what i
experienced
was rape you know like not having
necessarily the language for it
um and it seems like such an obviously
neanderthal thing like of course
language shapes our thinking but it was
really interesting to read about
um to read about the history of the law
and like what shaped
these motivations behind certain
definitions but then something else was
um
i never quote like i understood it
conceptually but this idea of gender
performance
or the performance of gender and i
you know when i started my project and i
was going to reach out i
reached out to this former friend i
thought okay i'm going to be very tough
on him i'm going to ask him
you know really hard questions and i i
have a list in the book of questions i
thought i was going to ask him and then
as soon as i heard his voice i recorded
all of these
conversations as soon as i heard his
voice i slipped back into
like our friendship i mean we had been
friends for almost five years and so
i immediately became accommodating and
wanting to make him comfortable
and saying oh no no no i'm okay like
enough time has passed
uh and like listening back to it was a
little more defined because i knew to an
extent
certainly i that i did this but i just
didn't realize to what extent so that
was something
interesting that i learned about myself
um but uh so much of the book became
about female
friendships like a lot of my friends
read the transcripts
of the conversations my interviews with
him and you know they were
um they found it so obnoxious like his
uh his answers and then i would make
excuses
for him uh and so that it was just
the self-awareness that came through and
writing the project
i think was really meaningful not that i
write for catharsis or
and it's not that but um
but i think the history of rape law and
then just listening to those interviews
and transcribing them and really
witnessing myself
performing like doing gender performance
where it doesn't feel like a performance
right it feels very genuine
but these are learned behaviors so say
those were two of the big things i
learned
okay and jasmine how about you what did
you learn while writing this
yearbook uh i guess maybe on like a
philosophical level which i can only
now see after having written the book
but
this idea of writing into what you're
afraid of
in some ways and things that make you
uncomfortable and in doing that
you can find this like patch of light to
work within
and i think that um when i first started
this book
i was um coming up against a lot of
walls because i didn't want to go to
these places that
made me uncomfortable or made me upset
and realizing that
through writing into that i would be
able to kind of get to the light
on the other side and then
the main character jude is confident
in a way that i wasn't as a young person
and i think that in writing her
confidence
and this sort of
bravery it sort of made me braver to be
able to
go out and talk about this book um
in ways that used to make me really
uncomfortable to talk
um about and so i think that i kind of
learned
um through writing that um
yeah so i don't know and just a
a big part of writing for kids is
getting to see
how children react to the book and
absorb the book and
before the world shut down i was getting
to do a lot of school visits and i think
that
through writing this book i've learned
again it's reconfirmed so much for what
i thought about the young reader but
that you can trust them and they make
these connections and
they've taught me things about the book
that i didn't realize so i guess i've
learned
um from that from writing but that's
been like an incredible gift to see
the book again um kind of through uh the
way that they experienced it
okay one one final question i have and
anybody can jump in if you know
what's next for you what will your next
project be
anybody want to share that well
i have a new book coming out in may um
it's another middle grade novel
it's called the shape of thunder um and
it is about two young girls who
um it takes place um
a year after a school shooting has
happened at the high school and they're
small ohio town they're both
middle schoolers um but the book
explores the way
um they've both been affected by this
tragedy they're kind of on
opposite sides of the tragedy and their
friendship has
uh been fractured by it so i talked a
little bit i guess at the beginning when
we were asked about like favorite books
when we were young about
the bridge to terabitha and this book in
some ways is like my homage to that book
it's a book about
two um kids who are
kind of finding a place where they can
feel safe
and kind of feels like magic when the
rest of the world
feels unseen thank you anybody else want
to mention what's next
in their world with books um i've
had success in projects in the past of
not necessarily knowing what the end
project or product was going to look
like or the connections that i was going
to find once i started exploring a topic
but
i i went up to alberta a few
years ago to work with some ecologists
who were studying this short grass
fescue prairie
in southern alberta and at the time i
was really
obsessed with this idea of
points of inaccessibility which are the
points on a body of the point on a body
of land
which is the furthest point you can get
from any
shoreline and the
point of inaccessibility in north
america is in south dakota and my plan
was to
visit this this if i try to find this
spot
on my way up to alberta or my way back
and i was just
kind of consumed with this idea of
standing
on the heart of the continent um
but the more time i spent up in alberta
with these ecologists and these
scientists who are studying
this really complex ecosystem the more i
realized that the identity in the heart
of a of a geographic place is
much more abstract and takes into
consideration a lot more things than
just
um the physical location um and so that
was an example of a project that really
like just kind of unfolded around me as
i was within it
and right now i'm really interested in
in um barn owls which are an endangered
species in iowa
and i'm not really sure
where the barn owls are going to take me
but um
i think just kind of jumping with both
feet um has worked out well in the past
and so
i've i've got these kinds of ideas of
knocking together some nesting boxes and
um
just seeing what happens um once the
barn owls come to visit
okay anybody else want to share what's
next
no um yeah sure okay as
as we speak as like i turn around like
i'm here in my studio in rhode island
but i'm working on my my next book it's
not a book i wrote but it's a book i'm
illustrating called everybody in the red
brick building who's supposed to come in
2021
and it's this really fabulous little
bedtime story
about this red brick building that's all
quiet and everything's wonderful
and then the baby wakes up the baby
wakes up somebody else and somebody else
so please feel free to look forward for
that um
sometime another fall okay
anybody else uh going once
going twice sure i'll talk
i'm actually deep into another book
project now that's um
it's naturally it's got birds in it but
it's about the history
of uh discovery sort of the end of the
age of discovery of birds in eastern
north america
uh in the early 1800s when almost all
the obvious birds had been discovered i
mean everybody knew about
blue jays and red-headed woodpeckers but
just sort of the
the last few birds in that region uh to
be discovered and why they
remained undetected for so long so i'm
pretty far along with that
okay anybody else
