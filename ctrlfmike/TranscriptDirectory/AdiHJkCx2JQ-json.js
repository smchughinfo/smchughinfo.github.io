    "revised code section 2305.113",
    "c it included specific exceptions that",
    "could extend",
    "the very strict four-year limit on",
    "bringing bringing a medical malpractice",
    "claim",
    "in ohio the reversal savings statute",
    "revised code 2305.19",
    "was not among those exceptions the court",

    "in antoon",
    "and i think council what's the purpose",
    "of the statute of repose why was it",
    "enacted",
    "there are several purposes your honor",
    "one",
    "is to ensure that medical providers",
    "have notice of claims another is to",
    "ensure that those claims",
    "don't get stale and most importantly i",
    "think it is to",
    "end the uh",
    "finally firmly and finally end claims uh",
    "so that they can be free from liability",
    "as the language this and other courts",
    "have used",
    "so for those three reasons how does the",
    "savings statute",
    "go contrary to those reasons uh",
    "well i think most importantly uh your",
    "honor the savings statute",
    "would allow medical claims against",
    "medical providers",
    "to continue essentially uh for many many",
    "years",
    "uh beyond what the general assembly has",
    "how many many years",
    "if you only get one refiling",
    "it's it well it's it's it's unknown your",
    "honor as you know in ohio",
    "uh you can voluntarily dismiss under 41a",
    "on the eve of trial",
    "uh refile and so a case might have been",
    "going on for",
    "seven or eight years uh a a plaintiff",
    "could",
    "dismiss and refile and then start the",
    "clock completely over because",
    "as this court has said very clearly in",
    "antune and many other cases",
    "a dismissal under 41a terminates the",
    "original case as if it never",
    "happened and a new case commences at",
    "that point",
    "but the defendants are on there on",
    "notice that there's a claim",
    "i mean all the reasons for the statute",
    "of repose here",
    "are are not there's no derogation of",
    "those",
    "when applying the the saving statute",
    "that applies to",
    "to all cases i i don't see how this",
    "should",
    "be any different uh two two points i",
    "think justice stewart one",
    "is uh that is not uh it does not serve",
    "all of the purposes",
    "of a statute of propose one of the",
    "purposes is to firmly and finally end",
    "liability in the specter of liability",
    "for",
    "medical providers and the statute of",
    "repose",
    "as written by the general assembly uh",
    "intends for that period to end",
    "uh four years after the act or",
    "occurrence",
    "so that certainly is not met by the",
    "saving statute now that this",
    "closes is commencing with within four",
    "years",
    "commencement yes your honor and this",
    "court has been very clear since at least",
    "the devil case in 1959",
    "that uh when a when a case is dismissed",
    "under rule 41a",
    "it is if it is is as if it never existed",
    "and so you look at the new case and when",
    "it commenced",
    "uh we think the logic of antoon uh",
    "really drives the decision",
    "here your honor and while this court",
    "left open the question",
    "uh it did not uh suggest that the courts",
    "of appeals should write on a blank slate",
    "in fact there are important lessons to",
    "be drawn",
    "from antoon well from a legal standpoint",
    "yes this is this",
    "is it's as if it never existed but the",
    "defendants are put on notice",
    "of the of the claim which is one of the",
    "things the statute of proposal is",
    "supposed to protect",
    "because i would imagine if there's",
    "litigation on a case and then it is",
    "dismissed",
    "as if it never happened i can't imagine",
    "a defendant would could go to the lawyer",
    "and say",
    "well i don't owe you anything because",
    "the litigation never happened",
    "your honor i i i'm not going to dispute",
    "the fact that",
    "what that that in this situation that",
    "particular",
    "purpose of the statute of uh of repose",
    "is not really an issue these cases were",
    "refiled fairly closely in time",
    "afterwards so there was notice",
    "of course as you pointed out the the",
    "question really is one of law not policy",
    "and so uh we think the statute of repose",
    "is very clear",
    "on its plain language uh and that uh as",
    "i was saying the decision in entune",
    "says very clearly that uh when looking",
    "at the statute of proposed for medical",
    "claims",
    "uh the court should look to the newly",
    "filed complaint the complaint in this",
    "case filed in hamilton county in 2015",
    "and decide whether that complaint was",
    "filed within four years of the actor or",
    "occurrence",
    "there's no dispute here that it did not",
    "and so",
    "we think the statute of repose applies",
    "fundamentally the one thing i think this",
    "court and the general assembly have been",
    "clear about",
    "in antoon going back to ruther in other",
    "cases",
    "is that statutes of repose are different",
    "from statutes of limitations",
    "where statutes of limitations can have",
    "equitable",
    "polling or the exceptions generally in",
    "the statutes",
    "apply statutes of repose are to be read",
    "strictly",
    "that's not just what this court says",
    "it's what the ohio the u.s supreme court",
    "has said over and over again",
    "including cts corp versus wahlberger and",
    "the calpers cases that we cite",
    "in our briefs so uh while",
    "the underlying policy considerations uh",
    "may be useful",
    "uh i think this court has to start with",
    "the plain language",
    "and read the statute of repose as the",
    "general assembly",
    "intended it this is part of",
    "a long-running",
    "work by the general assembly in this",
    "court to understand",
    "the limits of medical malpractice claims",
    "the general assembly has put very strict",
    "limits on those claims it treats them",
    "very differently uh a plaintiff has to",
    "get an affidavit of merit which is not",
    "something we require",
    "of other torts the statute of",
    "limitations is only a year and there is",
    "a statute of repose we think the general",
    "assembly",
    "has signaled very clearly that",
    "medical malpractice claims",
    "should be strictly uh limited",
    "and this court the council the savings",
    "statute then has no relevance here",
    "if you say that the um",
    "uh that the um",
    "statute of repose is the",
    "consideration the guide guidance here uh",
    "the savings has no even though they",
    "filed within the one year",
    "is that what you're saying uh yes chief",
    "justice the",
    "the the saving statute applies to",
    "statute of limitations",
    "and and it in fact applies to statutes",
    "of limitations and medical claims",
    "uh this court has said so since saunders",
    "in 1984 and we don't dispute that",
    "it applies to statutes of limitations",
    "generally we think the rule",
    "is and should be reinforced here",
    "that there are no exceptions to extend",
    "statutes of repose",
    "other than those explicitly written into",
    "the statutes by the general assembly we",
    "think that's what",
    "this court's uh the logic of this",
    "court's in tune decision",
    "dictates we think that's what ruther",
    "dictates uh and",
    "uh and so yes the the statute the saving",
    "statutes applies",
    "to the statute of limitations unless the",
    "general assembly expressly says",
    "otherwise",
    "uh and if you see uh at page 24 of our",
    "brief we have a chart that shows",
    "that the general assembly has from time",
    "to time done that",
    "it references 2305.1",
    "in the product liability saving in the",
    "product liability statute of repose",
    "and so uh there we think the general",
    "assembly was saying yes",
    "use the stat the savings statute",
    "the key here too of course your honors",
    "is that the general assembly",
    "has specific exceptions that it did",
    "write into",
    "the statute of repose the council",
    "but couldn't do the legislature have",
    "said this saving statute",
    "does not apply to the statute or oppose",
    "um yes it could your honor but i don't",
    "think it ever thought that it needed to",
    "based on",
    "the long history of jurisprudence of",
    "this court and the state of ohio the",
    "ever changing legislature",
    "you don't think that they i mean because",
    "time and time again we have seen",
    "or that or where that isn't necessarily",
    "the case",
    "so if we wanted to be clear that it",
    "didn't apply",
    "it seems like they would specifically",
    "have noted that",
    "that they yes that could have been",
    "another way they did it i think",
    "they did it very very clearly here",
    "though by",
    "incorporating certain exceptions and not",
    "incorporating others",
    "i think of it frankly as there being a",
    "menu of",
    "ways to extend statutes of limitations",
    "in",
    "ohio law the savings statute is one of",
    "them",
    "unsound mind disability or minority is",
    "another",
    "uh and the general assembly chose from",
    "that menu picked particular things to",
    "put into 2305.113 c",
    "crafted a very detailed uh and specific",
    "uh exceptions to that in section d of",
    "this statute",
    "and so i think you have to read that to",
    "say that what they didn't incorporate",
    "they did not intend to apply plaintiff",
    "i'm sorry council",
    "planets use the savings statute for a",
    "variety of reasons",
    "and it could amount to",
    "on the eve of trial having one of their",
    "experts pass away or some type of",
    "emergency like that",
    "and they might refile the case right",
    "after a month",
    "but after the the statute of repose do",
    "you think the legislature intended cases",
    "uh in which that occurs to be not",
    "decided on the merits simply because",
    "the refiling fell after the",
    "uh expiration of the statute or opposed",
    "something that had been lit being",
    "litigated",
    "fully beforehand i i do your honor and i",
    "think",
    "i think that this court has uh made",
    "clear that that is",
    "uh permissible i think um when you look",
    "at",
    "there are lots of uh consequences to",
    "rule 41a dismissals i think uh justice",
    "mcgee brown and her",
    "concurrence in ruther made clear at",
    "paragraph 38 of that decision",
    "that any deadline may have a harsh",
    "result for the person who misses that",
    "deadline",
    "but those are the choices the general",
    "assembly is allowed to make in deciding",
    "what the deadline isn't missed here",
    "that's that's the point it's",
    "it's not miss and an example that",
    "justice donnelly gave",
    "there is nothing missed the litigation",
    "has gone",
    "on missing the deadline is is one thing",
    "and and the statute talks about",
    "commencement clearly the",
    "the action has been commenced",
    "uh justice stewart i think antoon makes",
    "clear though that",
    "once voluntarily dismissed this court",
    "and the general assembly treat that",
    "action as it was",
    "as if it was never commenced so i think",
    "you really do have to look at the",
    "second the new filing of the new action",
    "and um and how is that how is your",
    "interpretation just",
    "how how is it just from from a policy",
    "standpoint",
    "from a statutory interpretation",
    "standpoint from a",
    "from a case law standpoint of of cases",
    "should be decided on their merits",
    "i i i i think justice stewart that the",
    "general assembly uh as this court said",
    "in",
    "antoon uh and uh is is balancing",
    "it is essentially the one that",
    "determines that balance of fairness",
    "and justice uh in this setting",
    "to go back to what justice mcgee brown",
    "said",
    "she said the results may seem harsh but",
    "it is the general assembly's decision",
    "to determine uh where to draw those",
    "lines",
    "uh this court if i had filed my",
    "memorandum in support of jurisdiction at",
    "501 on the day that it was due",
    "would have told me that i couldn't uh",
    "continue my appeal",
    "it is a harsh result but uh it is one",
    "uh that uh this court enforces strictly",
    "uh even if that might be unjust for my",
    "client and certainly if this court can",
    "enforce rules in that strict of a manner",
    "the general assembly can decide",
    "to enforce strict rules as well",
    "and they're also this is where this",
    "court takes not on civil matters",
    "obviously but",
    "also grants delayed appeals that are not",
    "timely",
    "uh it it does from from time to time",
    "your honor and the general assembly",
    "uh if it was making the deadlines for",
    "this court could make those choices as",
    "well",
    "but i do think those are the choices for",
    "the general assembly to make we think",
    "they've clearly made them here",
    "uh madam chief justice i've i'm over my",
    "time i'd like to reserve what i have",
    "left",
    "okay thank you mr flowers",
    "uh good morning uh chief justice",
    "o'connor uh members of the court",
    "my name is uh paul flowers i represent",
    "the plaintiff peles in this case",
    "robert williams and michael and amber",
    "sands",
    "um i have a number of co-counsel on the",
    "case with me who i'm not going to",
    "introduce but i know they're actively",
    "watching because of all the text",
    "messages i'm receiving",
    "and with that i will say i would like to",
    "start off with with",
    "judge justice stewart's initial question",
    "uh which i really thought got right to",
    "the heart of it that dealt with",
    "the policy considerations um let me just",
    "say first i",
    "thought one of the the criticisms of the",
    "first district's opinion that is unfair",
    "is that they were engaging in",
    "public policy which is not true",
    "they were following legislative policy",
    "there's a big difference",
    "we know what the legislative policy is",
    "for the statute of proposal in this case",
    "because",
    "this court identified it in both and",
    "tuned",
    "and in ruther and what we're really",
    "looking for here is to",
    "one make sure there's no indefinite",
    "litigation a definite filing on",
    "litigation and two to provide certainty",
    "and predictability",
    "um for the for the defendants",
    "in the first district just looks at this",
    "and says you know what",
    "this doesn't violate any of that um",
    "they're using it as a cross check",
    "they're just applying the plain and",
    "ordinary meaning of these two statutes",
    "uh which can be applied together",
    "and the first district's opinion look it",
    "looks at that and says",
    "uh by doing this we are not overwriting",
    "these policies",
    "uh the defendants get notice within the",
    "four years of the lawsuit they can",
    "preserve witnesses they can gather",
    "evidence they can prepare their defenses",
    "um they have the notice that's what the",
    "statute proposes intended to accomplish",
    "instead of looking at policy",
    "considerations i'm most concerned",
    "with the actual language of the statute",
    "so how do you",
    "how do you address the language that we",
    "have in the statute of propose",
    "that i'm paraphrasing but says this is",
    "it",
    "this is all you have it's it's four",
    "years how",
    "how do you address that i agree with you",
    "100",
    "you have four years to file your claim",
    "it's it's the other side of the window",
    "so statute limitations is one side of",
    "the window statute or opposed the other",
    "side of the window",
    "you have to file it uh within the four",
    "years and that was accomplished here",
    "i mean um it was done and the statute of",
    "proposals satisfied",
    "statute opposed at that point can be set",
    "aside now we have the statute of",
    "we have the savings statute that comes",
    "in only because",
    "the action had to be dismissed to get a",
    "venue that was going to",
    "lead to a faster trial um in hamilton",
    "county",
    "the council council according to my",
    "calculations and",
    "maybe my math is off but uh didn't uh",
    "the um wilson's uh",
    "four and a half years uh post surgery",
    "and sans",
    "five years post surgery in the uh",
    "filing for the for the refiling in",
    "hamilton county",
    "yes yes that's about right the refiling",
    "in hamilton county was five days after",
    "the dismissal",
    "that's december 16 2015 and then we had",
    "about two weeks",
    "um for the sands uh they refiled in",
    "december 9 2015",
    "you know scarcely any gap in time at all",
    "well you know scarcely you know it i",
    "mean that's",
    "not what the statue said as as justice",
    "french uh",
    "the statute of repose bars a suit that",
    "is brought after a specified time",
    "uh and it as",
    "codified uh provides that medical claims",
    "must be commenced within",
    "four years after the occurrence",
    "so clearly the filing in hamilton county",
    "was after four years",
    "there's no dispute on that right true",
    "the",
    "filing in butler county was within four",
    "years well within four years but that's",
    "as though it never happened right the",
    "nullity theory",
    "right and and if if you go down that",
    "path um",
    "then all of a sudden we can never apply",
    "um the statute the the saving statute to",
    "any case",
    "wait a second it that comports with",
    "antoon",
    "does it not well we have no problem with",
    "the n2",
    "at least not today but we have no",
    "problem with antoon today",
    "and everything we're saying and all our",
    "positions are entirely consistent with",
    "both ruther and and tim",
    "um yes there's a lot of supreme court",
    "cases that remark",
    "that once you voluntarily dismiss the",
    "case it's as if it never exists but",
    "that's that's",
    "never been applied to an extreme so for",
    "example",
    "if you have an appeal in the first case",
    "um it's remanded",
    "and then the plane of voluntary dismiss",
    "that case we don't we don't rip that",
    "appellate decision out of the law books",
    "it's still there it and if a defendant",
    "makes an admission or any party makes it",
    "admission",
    "in the first case in a deposition um",
    "they're stuck with that admission in the",
    "second case as well what happened with",
    "antoon",
    "well with antoon this court didn't go to",
    "the question of whether or not the",
    "savings statute",
    "applied i mean justice piffer pointed",
    "out that would have been a really easy",
    "quick and easy way to",
    "to resolve antoon but that issue wasn't",
    "resolved and for good reason you know",
    "the case was already resolved in the",
    "fact that they didn't meet the statutory",
    "repose in the first place",
    "well right it in in tune it was as",
    "though it never happened it never",
    "the first filings didn't save uh the",
    "subsequent well there there's that that",
    "sentence in antoine absolutely",
    "but i don't think that was critical of",
    "the decision at all it wasn't i mean",
    "in tune was a procedural mess a lot of",
    "it was filed pro se",
    "um they just didn't satisfy the savings",
    "statute in the first place",
    "i mean here both claims were filed",
    "within the four years",
    "um so as justice stewart indicated",
    "nothing was missed",
    "um everybody was on notice they could",
    "prepare a defense",
    "um all the purpose of the statute were",
    "satisfied",
    "and and one thing i thought was really",
    "interesting going through all this case",
    "law was was judge monk's",
    "concurring opinion in the mcneil case in",
    "the first district",
    "i mean judge monk looks at section c2 of",
    "the statute of propose",
    "it and i'm a paraphrasing here but he's",
    "it",
    "section c2 if an action is not commenced",
    "in four years",
    "any action upon that claim is barred and",
    "he looks at the interaction between ann",
    "and annie and says you know it's",
    "contemplating future actions so the",
    "converse is",
    "if an action is filed within four years",
    "then any action",
    "on that claim is not barred um but",
    "it does contemplate future filings and",
    "future claims that's what what judge",
    "monk said and remember he's just",
    "one of several ohio judges now ohio",
    "appellate judges",
    "who have all gone our way on this i mean",
    "there is no ohio appellate level judge",
    "who has adopted the defense's",
    "interpretation these statues nor is",
    "there any federal judge",
    "applying ohio law they've all gone our",
    "way on this as well and i think that",
    "does say a lot that",
    "all these judges can read these statutes",
    "harmoniously",
    "and say like we can satisfy the purpose",
    "of this one",
    "we can satisfy the purpose of this one",
    "they work together",
    "there's no need for exceptions and",
    "whatnot mr flowers uh",
    "i i have a question it seems to me that",
    "when the legislature wants these",
    "savings statutes to apply to a statute",
    "of repose",
    "it knows how to do that and it does it",
    "expressly",
    "by referencing that exception to",
    "whatever statute of repose",
    "it's it's uh considering and it",
    "certainly did that",
    "with the products liability uh statute",
    "of repose",
    "so it and this obviously is one of your",
    "your colleagues arguments",
    "that when it wants when it wants the",
    "statute uh",
    "the savings statute to apply to a",
    "statute of repose that knows how to do",
    "that and it expressly does it",
    "and it did it with the product's",
    "liability it did not do it with respect",
    "to a medical claim",
    "why doesn't that indicate that",
    "it intended for the savings statute not",
    "to apply",
    "right well that's what what",
    "judge uh justice gorsuch and the u.s",
    "supreme court referred to recently as",
    "the canon of donut holes",
    "um this idea that um because an",
    "exception isn't there we're going to",
    "make an",
    "assumption from that or because specific",
    "language doesn't exist we we",
    "assume that they meant to exclude that",
    "um as the first district recognized and",
    "then they were citing in",
    "the in tune or the the atwood case um",
    "it's a real",
    "poor measure of statutory interpretation",
    "so what what justice is but it's a it's",
    "a well-recognized one",
    "uh it has been applied in many many",
    "cases",
    "at least in this state well this is",
    "just justice gorsuch's decisions from",
    "bostic versus georgia which came out",
    "just",
    "a couple of months ago it's the big",
    "homosexual transgender",
    "gender title vii case and he writes",
    "nor is there any such thing as a canon",
    "of donut holes",
    "in which congress's failure to speak",
    "directly to a specific case that falls",
    "within a more general statutory rule",
    "creates a tacit exception instead when",
    "congress chooses not to include an",
    "exception to a broad rule courts apply",
    "the broad rule",
    "and that's just basic straight statutory",
    "interpretation is is",
    "uh justice french was it was uh",
    "expressing it it's just the words of the",
    "statute",
    "we're not going to worry about what",
    "could have been in there what's in",
    "something else",
    "what what they might have done what they",
    "could have done i mean you could play",
    "that game both ways",
    "um because you could say just as easily",
    "well you know",
    "saving statutes here was amended pretty",
    "substantially in 2009",
    "uh they didn't carve out an exception",
    "exception for the statute of repose",
    "um ergo that means they meant to include",
    "the statute of repose within the savings",
    "statute",
    "i mean it you can play this game both",
    "ways endlessly",
    "and that's why it's just a very poor",
    "indication of legislative intent which",
    "we don't need",
    "because these statutes aren't ambiguous",
    "i mean the defendants kind of allude to",
    "this in the brief they say if it's",
    "ambiguous then this you know",
    "they don't want to come out and say it",
    "but it's easy to read",
    "these words work together quite a few",
    "ohio judges have already concluded that",
    "that both of these statutes can be read",
    "harmoniously",
    "um together um and serve their purposes",
    "so so you you you really don't have an",
    "answer to the logic of the point i made",
    "you you just don't like the point that's",
    "what it sounds like to me",
    "well not you know what i what i've",
    "tried to say maybe not too eloquently is",
    "that um",
    "trying to pick out what legislature",
    "could have done",
    "what they could have excluded what they",
    "could have included that's a game that",
    "everybody can play",
    "from both sides and we can play just as",
    "easily as they can so",
    "i'm urging the court not to go down that",
    "road which the first district refused to",
    "go down",
    "um for good reason um now it's",
    "interesting",
    "the wade case and this is the 1986",
    "decision from",
    "from the 10th district that judge norris",
    "wrote who's still",
    "sitting on the sixth circuit today uh",
    "the defense have completely",
    "misinterpreted this because he says",
    "he says you know there's an exception in",
    "the statute",
    "saving statute it doesn't apply here",
    "here go",
    "the saving statute applies to this",
    "medical malpractice claim where we've",
    "got a statute or opposed issue",
    "you know that simple um and then he does",
    "get into a little bit of this kind of",
    "negativity reasoning after that",
    "which he does get criticized for in",
    "other courts",
    "but that's way back in 1986 on that they",
    "looked at this and said you know we're",
    "just not going to speculate",
    "as to what could be there what couldn't",
    "be there because",
    "all we really know from the legislature",
    "is what they intended to do",
    "which was make sure that we don't have",
    "one",
    "endless opportunities to file and two we",
    "provide certainty",
    "um and predictability for the defendants",
    "we do know that also",
    "they picked four years they for whatever",
    "reason",
    "they picked four years in order to",
    "achieve that certainty uh give a window",
    "large enough to accommodate some of the",
    "vagaries that happen during",
    "litigation and they say after four years",
    "reading the statute no exceptions the",
    "window shut",
    "well right and it's four years to do",
    "what and the answer is",
    "four years to file a claim that was done",
    "here",
    "right it's not four years to get your",
    "claim",
    "counselor your claim was as though it",
    "was never",
    "filed in butler county uh",
    "right you know as i indicated if if if",
    "that's gonna be the holding then you're",
    "gonna have to overrule freisinger i mean",
    "a case that was unanimous",
    "on that point and has stood for 33 years",
    "without any legislative interference",
    "fraizinger says council they said four",
    "years",
    "to prevent claims from coming out of the",
    "blue",
    "right exactly it's to prevent that sort",
    "of surprise where all of a sudden you've",
    "got",
    "endless periods to file um it's hard for",
    "the defendants to find witnesses and",
    "gather evidence",
    "after a lot of passage of time none of",
    "that's a concern here",
    "um because the the initial initial side",
    "of the window was met",
    "i mean that those claims were filed in",
    "there everybody knew it was coming",
    "and and dr durrani's choice was to flee",
    "now that brings up another point which",
    "is that",
    "anything that happens here today is",
    "going to be advisory um because",
    "because he fled um right now the statute",
    "of limitations",
    "and the statute of oppose is being told",
    "and",
    "the tolling statute is very specific is",
    "what it encompasses and it includes",
    "uh the statute of repose but we don't",
    "have that issue in front of us",
    "correct well you know i always think",

    "the decision rendered in our armco",
    "versus public utility commission 1982",
    "this court said",
    "it is well settled that this court does",
    "not indulge itself in advisory opinions",
    "and that's what we're going to have here",
    "because we go right back down and he's",
    "still overseas",
    "and the statute of proposals is still",
    "going to be told um",
    "so yes we're talking about important",
    "legislative policies or whatnot but they",

    "all because they were met second of all",
    "because",

    "don't",
    "you don't want to give up on anything i",
    "still think it's important",
    "as several ohio judges have now",
    "indicated",

    "that you know you can read these",

    "um and when you do there's no need for",

    "first district court of appeals",
    "misapplication of this court's decision",
    "in",
    "jean-baptiste it also",

    "expansion of juvenile court",
    "jurisdictions in these matters",
    "as well as the extension of the length",

    "the classification and the modification",
    "and the review or the termination if we",

    "um certainly uh the amicus in this",
    "matter",
    "addressed uh the possibility of this",
    "court being able",
    "to reconsider or revisit jean-baptiste",
    "but it's certainly the state of ohio's",
    "position it's not entirely necessary",
    "for that to occur because jean-baptiste",
    "is",
    "very distinguishable with from what",
    "occurred here in that",
    "the initial classification hearing under",
    "2152",
    "0.83 is what was involved in",
    "jean-baptiste",
    "and that is the statutory mechanism that",
    "the state",
    "is indicating provides the extension of",
    "jurisdiction",
    "when it comes to rb's case",
    "the the statute's very specific that",
    "the init once the initial classification",
    "occurs",
    "that continues until and unless",
    "it is modified or terminated",
    "so certainly i think that um if",
    "this court were to want to reconsider",
    "because",
    "again in john baptiste that",
    "some of those extensions and the",
    "expansion",
    "provisions those weren't at all",
    "addressed in jean-baptiste but again",
    "i don't think it's entirely necessary",
    "that that occurred here",
    "council council the initial",
    "classification",
    "happened uh uh when the case was being",
    "uh resolved in juvenile court correct",
    "yes your honor and he was then a tier",
    "one uh",
    "um uh reporter correct",
    "correct and okay and so then",
    "pardon me there was actually an",
    "agreement that that was the appropriate",
    "letter right",
    "right i understand how that was resolved",
    "and then he goes through several years",
    "and there's",
    "counseling and there's uh you know uh",
    "non-reporting probation and a variety of",
    "things that happen",
    "and is it you say it would be",
    "unnecessary for the trial court then to",
    "have another",
    "hearing prior to the uh",
    "you know the end of the uh case prior to",
    "him turning 21 uh for",
    "the further duties for another",
    "declaration of what his duties and",
    "responsibilities are",
    "for reporting no you're on i don't think",
    "it's unnecessary",
    "um and is it mandatory it is mandatory",
    "that the hearing take place",
    "but the timing the timing of that",
    "hearing",
    "and especially when you look at the",
    "circumstances in this case",
    "that the timing of the hearing is",
    "directory um and i think that if we look",
    "at",
    "um you know that that's been well let me",
    "let me stop you right there and see if",
    "we agree on this",
    "that there was an initial determination",
    "uh and that followed him for the next uh",
    "three four years right yes",
    "okay and then it was incumbent upon the",
    "court",
    "to have another determination made",
    "to define his duties and",
    "responsibilities with regard to",
    "reporting",
    "going forward yes",
    "okay and when did that second hearing",
    "take place",
    "okay well what we have here is an",
    "attempt for that second hearing to take",
    "place",
    "around 2014. um and",
    "and initially rb",
    "had filed a ceiling application",
    "uh with the court in 2014 and",
    "the court said you know what at this",
    "time you're not eligible",
    "because we still have to have this",
    "completion of disposition hearing",
    "so from that moment forward subsequent",
    "to that ceiling that that was",
    "that was denied because they they still",
    "needed to proceed on",
    "uh the the um whether the classification",
    "was going to be",
    "maintained from that moment forward",
    "it was rb who constantly once that",
    "completion of disposition hearing got",
    "scheduled it was rb",
    "himself who had constantly been",
    "challenging um the court's jurisdiction",
    "or asking for continuance what",
    "difference does that make",
    "the court's in control of his schedule",
    "correct but the court i think",
    "in all regard understanding that",
    "rb wanted to get this matter continued",
    "to ultimately have the classification",
    "removed",
    "attempted to hold that hearing that",
    "mandatory hearing that the court",
    "knew it needed to have it wasn't that",
    "the court was trying not to have the",
    "hearing",
    "the court was very patiently attempting",
    "uh to complete this okay and again and",
    "again you would agree",
    "the court is the uh arbiter on when a",
    "hearing will take place and could have",
    "scheduled a hearing",
    "within the time before he turned 21.",
    "and it did it scheduled that hearing",
    "multiple no no i could have held it",
    "let's just say he could have",
    "held it correct but when we talk about",
    "fundamental fairness here when he's",
    "asking for new evaluations",
    "or new councils coming in um",
    "at various times of this i i think that",
    "we would have a fairness problem if the",
    "court at that moment had forced",
    "um that hearing um to occur when",
    "they weren't ready for it i mean the rb",
    "and his side weren't ready for it so i i",
    "don't think that",
    "um the way the court um",
    "handled this matter was in any way",
    "unfair at all",
    "um i and i think that um",
    "again there's been so many arguments in",
    "this matter with regard to jurisdiction",
    "and i think when the court looks at the",
    "the voluminous",
    "record in this case that jurisdiction",
    "was constantly",
    "uh being attacked and so the court was",
    "stopping at each moment",
    "to address those attacks and if we look",
    "at",
    "this historically this court's analysis",
    "when it comes to whether or not um",
    "the timing provision um that's provided",
    "in statute is",
    "mandatory versus directory i think the",
    "the big indicator here",
    "is that um loss of jurisdiction is never",
    "specifically addressed isn't that really",
    "the issue not whether it's",
    "mandatory or directory but what the",
    "remedy for the",
    "if it can be mandatory but the question",
    "is what the remedy is for the",
    "trial court's failure to hold it when",
    "uh it's required to do so does that i",
    "agree with that",
    "i mean what what why why why is that",
    "juris",
    "why would that be jurisdictional i mean",
    "why would why would the remedy be",
    "as in many cases court doesn't do",
    "something they're supposed to do you",
    "file it rid of mandamus",
    "right and certainly in this scenario i i",
    "i don't",
    "believe that lack of jurisdiction is the",
    "appropriate",
    "uh remedy that the the fact that this",
    "certainly it's subsumed within this",
    "whole statutory provision",
    "that this is going to continue on beyond",
    "the the juvenile obtaining the age of",
    "21.",
    "um that that's you know from the get-go",
    "that jurisdiction is expanded",
    "and in fact i think if we look to um the",
    "fact",
    "that they even the general assembly even",
    "um address the general relinquishment of",
    "control of a child when they're",
    "committed to dys",
    "in when they amended this this statute",
    "um",
    "all other times that when a juvenile is",
    "committed to dys",
    "the juvenile court relinquishes control",
    "but there was a specific exception",
    "that's provided",
    "um in in this whole statutory scheme and",
    "i think that speaks volumes",
    "um to the intent of the general assembly",
    "is not for the juvenile court",
    "um to lose jurisdiction to make these",
    "modifications or terminations of the",
    "juvenile even if they",
    "turn 21 and i'd like to reserve the rest",
    "of my time unless there's any other",
    "questions",
    "okay but before miss nestler starts i",
    "neglected to",
    "introduce judge eileen gallagher from",
    "the 8th district court of appeals who's",
    "sitting",
    "in place of justice fischer who's",
    "recused on this matter",
    "welcome judge all right",
    "miss nestler thank you",
    "chief justice o'connor associate",
    "justices may it please the court",
    "my name is julie kars nessler and i",

    "rb",
    "i'd like to reserve two minutes for",
    "rebuttal",
    "the state this morning has asserted that",
    "really this case is about",
    "whether a juvenile classification can",
    "continue",
    "beyond the age of 21. that's not the",
    "issue in this case this case",
    "this court has already decided that",
    "issue in ds",
    "this case is about the act of",
    "classifying",
    "the act of classification has to occur",
    "at a time in which the juvenile court",
    "has jurisdiction and with the authority",
    "to act",
    "the court has authority to act when the",
    "statute is followed",
    "was there wasn't a classification",
    "already made here",
    "your honor it was an initial",
    "classification under",
    "the juvenile the legislature enacted a",
    "statutory scheme for imposing",
    "classifications",
    "the 0.83 initial classification alone is",
    "not enough",
    "well this this the scheme says uses",
    "words like can choose to continue",
    "modify so it seems like it's already",
    "been classified here",
    "your honor i would respectfully disagree",
    "with that characterization the language",
    "of the statute specifically makes clear",
    "that that initial classification does",
    "not remain",
    "um does not continue without an",
    "affirmative act by the juvenile court",
    "that affirmative act is the hearing and",
    "the classification order under point",
    "eight",
    "four and specifically under point eight",
    "four",
    "where does the statute say that here",
    "your honor it says specifically in",
    "subsection a",
    "it says that the judge shall conduct a",
    "hearing to determine if the",
    "classification should be continued right",
    "but where does it say the part about it",
    "doesn't continue",
    "i think that's that's how your honor it",
    "has to be read",
    "into that so it doesn't say that but",
    "that's",
    "what you read that to me well yeah yes",
    "your honor because it's a statutory",
    "scheme",
    "each piece is an important puzzle to the",
    "classification",
    "um the the classification is a two-step",
    "process",
    "if the legislature would have intended",
    "for the .83",
    "initial classification to them enough",
    "then",
    "they would not have included 0.84 in",
    "this statutory scheme but they did so it",
    "has to have meaning",
    "these two provisions have to be read",
    "together they work in tandem",
    "further the uh state has relied upon",
    "subsection e um to and to argue that",
    "they have a continuation of jurisdiction",
    "that reliance is misplaced if you review",
    "that subsection",
    "that subsection only indicates that the",
    "order that will continue",
    "not that the act of classification and",
    "the act of jurisdiction",
    "to classify is what continues and um",
    "addition moreover again it says that the",
    "8-3 hearing is quote subject to",
    "0.84 once again it's not a complete",
    "process without that 0.84 hearing",
    "um if we consider as miss adams was",
    "describing",
    "uh the attempts by rb to continue",
    "the hearing isn't part of the problem",
    "here",
    "that we had those kinds of continuance",
    "requests",
    "happening so what should the what should",
    "the judge have done",
    "in in this situation then sure your",
    "honor as an initial",
    "matter uh first is the mandatory duty on",
    "the part of the court",
    "they're in control of this secondly the",
    "statements characterize characterized",
    "the record in this case the juvenile",
    "court did indeed",
    "docket uh rb's case for completion of",
    "disposition hearing",
    "in 2014. however he did not make assert",
    "um",
    "that hearing did not happen at that time",
    "rather in 2015 april 2015 to be exact",
    "the juvenile court quote withdrew the",
    "issue of reclassification",
    "that was on the juvenile court um then",
    "we went on from 2015",
    "2016. it was not until the state",
    "filed the motion to hold a completion of",
    "disposition hearing",
    "that the issue of a completion",
    "disposition here became",
    "at issue again and it was at that time",
    "that rb",
    "um that he challenged the court's",
    "jurisdiction",
    "i think also your honor to answer your",
    "question is that importantly",
    "um this statute the legislature was",
    "cleared intentional",
    "in choosing disposition to be the",
    "triggering event",
    "for these hearings um the court is in",
    "control of that disposition the",
    "disposition is the tether",
    "from the court to the juvenile what what",
    "does that mean",
    "when you say at the completion of",
    "disposition what is the timing",
    "that day that day your honor so it has",
    "to be that day",
    "that would be rv's position your honor",
    "that provides so",
    "so if the disposition ends",
    "on his 21st birthday",
    "uh i suppose this position isn't",
    "completed until",
    "11 59 of uh of the",
    "uh day before or uh so",
    "so when's the court hold the p the",
    "hearing",
    "hearing that case correct so your honor",
    "again",
    "the juvenile court it controls when the",
    "disposition terminates",
    "so they can terminate the disposition on",
    "the same day",
    "and they hold the hearing that same day",
    "as well",
    "they can do it earlier too though i mean",
    "the end date is his 21st birthday they",
    "could do it when he's",
    "20 and a half they could do it at any",
    "point they want to reevaluate",
    "um or you know take into consider",
    "consideration um",
    "you know what uh they conduct a hearing",
    "of the effectiveness of the disposition",
    "and any treatment provided to the child",
    "determination of risk and all the other",
    "factors that the judge has to take into",
    "consideration at a dispositional hearing",
    "does not have to be done on its 21st",
    "birthday absolutely not your honor",
    "you're absolutely correct again",
    "but but you but it does have to be done",
    "and you're reading on the exact day that",
    "the disposition ends",
    "yes yes right so the dispositions uh",
    "set to end on a sunday this court the",
    "court has to come in hold the",
    "disposition that day",
    "again your honor the juvenile court is",
    "the one that controls the disposition",
    "what if the child is sick on the day",
    "that the disposition sets in",
    "again again your honor that is within",
    "the providence of the juvenile court",
    "it's not within the problems that",
    "juvenile court if if the juvenile goes",
    "to the hospital the day that the",
    "disposition is supposed to end",
    "but your honor the disposition ends when",
    "the juvenile court says",
    "it ends so they can extend that",
    "disposition out",
    "and therefore extend the court's",
    "jurisdiction the",
    "uh again i wanted to relate back to the",
    "are you saying they can extend it past",
    "21",
    "no your honor 21 enter on that yes",
    "i'm sorry your honor i didn't",
    "i didn't hear your question i said be",
    "clear on that you said they can just",
    "you know extend it that's not you've got",
    "to qualify that",
    "okay your honor if i so the age 21 is",
    "the outermost bound",
    "this is similar to what this court",
    "recently found in um in ray aw",
    "age 21 is the the absolute last time",
    "that this court",
    "is the time the court uses jurisdiction",
    "so the day before is the absolute last",
    "time that the court could",
    "do complete the act of classifying so",
    "for um so i know that age 21 plays a",
    "role because of the facts of this",
    "particular case",
    "but for most youth it is going to be",
    "earlier than that it could be",
    "15 16 17. it all depends on what the",
    "disposition",
    "was ordered for that youth and the point",
    "that i was trying to make",
    "uh justice dewine is that the juvenile",
    "court is the one that",
    "terminates that disposition think i",
    "underst i understand that",
    "but i mean it seems a little impractical",
    "to say okay",
    "you've been ordered to complete this",
    "program the program ends on a certain",
    "day i",
    "i set this order for this position in a",
    "certain day",
    "and if the court does is not available",
    "to conduct a hearing on that very day",
    "uh then under your under your theory",
    "there's no jurisdiction over",
    "the juvenile no your honor that's not",
    "our theory um",
    "again what you said has to be done on",
    "the day of the completion of disposition",
    "correction but you're what you're saying",
    "is that treatment was the end of the",
    "disposition",
    "but for a situation like what the",
    "hypothetical you are posing",
    "typically that would require a child to",
    "be under orders of probation",
    "and so okay so i'm a judge i put i put",
    "the i put him on",
    "juvenile on community control for two",
    "years it ends on",
    "january 3rd 2020. i either have to",

    "your theory",
    "it would have to be i guess under your",

    "this court in in interpreting the",
    "juvenile sex offender",
    "statutes and nraia and nrads",

    "does the court have statutory authority",
    "to",
    "do the act in ia it was to do the",
    "initial classification",
    "under 0.83b in ds it was when can you",
    "determine the age jurisdiction",
    "the jurisdiction is tied to the",
    "statutory authority",
    "and you have to follow the statute to be",
    "vested with jurisdiction",
    "that's specifically what this court",
    "found in",
    "the age 21 is the outermost bound to",
    "that jurisdiction if you don't hold the",
    "hearing and don't continue the process",
    "for classification",
    "before the age of 21 that classification",

    "john gutie's and that's why this court",
    "should affirm the first district's",
    "decision",
    "that's one of the basis there's an",
    "additional basis for rb",
    "and that is that he completed his",
    "disposition in 2013",
    "and his hearing should have ha that",
    "happened at that time",
    "his disposition was entered december 2nd",
    "2011.",
    "he was placed on probation in order to",
    "complete",
    "treatment at ultracrest he completed",
    "that residential treatment and",
    "on february 6 2013 he",

    "aftercare",
    "until the juvenile court they were the",
    "ones who took the action",
    "they are the ones who completed found",
    "that he um",
    "determinated his probation that is the",
    "moment that july",
    "29 2013 is the moment he completed his",
    "disposition",
    "and the moment that the juvenile court",
    "had jurisdiction under .84",
    "to have the end of this position hearing",
    "they did not do that therefore they",
    "lacked",
    "jurisdiction to continue again the",
    "legislature was",

    "full process or a full",
    "scheme each piece has to be complied",
    "with",
    "in order to enter a valid classification",
    "the fatal",
    "the fatal error in this case is the",
    "juvenile court",
    "failed to continue rb's classification",
    "as required by 84 at a time in which it",
    "had jurisdiction",
    "again he rb turned 21 on july",
    "20th 2017. the juvenile court did not",
    "continue that classification",
    "until three months later on october 30th",
    "2017",
    "clearly outside the bounds of their",
    "jurisdiction the classification",
    "has to be rendered void additionally as",
    "i said",
    "the salient issue here for all juveniles",
    "in ohio is when must this completion of",
    "disposition carry occur",
    "and that completion of this position",
    "that hearing has to occur at the same",
    "time",
    "it's practical i know it's practical",
    "the court knows where the kid is at that",
    "time can bring that in",
    "can provide they have the records to",
    "allow them to be a well-informed",
    "fact-finder",
    "this case provides the clear example of",
    "what happens",
    "if that hearing is delayed here rv",
    "was unable to there is no um he was",
    "unable to present",
    "evidence related to the people that were",
    "intimately involved in his treatment",
    "the entire purpose of this hearing is to",
    "review the effectiveness of his",
    "treatment",
    "he cannot have a meaningful hearing when",
    "the witnesses that were involved in that",
    "treatment",
    "are unable to be located and are",
    "or if they are located or unwilling to",
    "testify because it's been four years",
    "from his treatment and i think that's",
    "important to reiterate one more time",
    "neuron",
    "is that the treatment that rb received",
    "in this case",
    "it was four years from the time the",
    "court reviewed him that is not what the",
    "legislature intended",
    "that's not what this court envisioned in",
    "n raid ds when it said that these",
    "children would get a procedural",
    "protection",
    "to ensure that these classifications",
    "only remain when it's",
    "necessary or the child hasn't been",
    "rehabilitated",
    "the the system failed rb in this case",
    "um and that leads me to",
    "rv's cross appeal again in order to",
    "have due process and the promise",
    "provided by this court in ds there had",
    "been",
    "a meaningful hearing and there just",
    "simply wasn't um additionally it's quite",
    "clear that he was prejudiced",
    "not only was rb did he lose an",
    "opportunity",
    "for removal but excuse me you filed you",
    "filed a cross appeal in this case",
    "um and i was i was a little concerned",
    "that you filed then you filed a reply",
    "brief",
    "but the reply brief didn't deal with the",
    "cross appeal",
    "it it was another it was essentially a",
    "sir reply on the merits what should we",
    "do with that that's",
    "you know that's not allowed by the rules",
    "should we strike that brief should we",
    "not consider the argument she raised in",
    "there",
    "no your honor i think because the due",
    "process",
    "claim intertwines with well this wasn't",
    "this wasn't about the due process",
    "claiming you",
    "directly addressed what you you directly",
    "replied to the reply brief",
    "that's well your honor well beyond the",
    "scope of what you're allowed to do and",
    "you're",
    "our our cross appeal there's two",
    "arguments the",
    "first argument is that you must comply",
    "with the statute",
    "so we are reiterating the same things of",
    "why the statute was not complied with",
    "the alternative argument is that if you",
    "agree that the statute was complied with",
    "that simply due process was not complied",
    "with in this case",
    "so that is why there that um that reply",
    "you have to agree that goes well that",
    "the arguments you made go",
    "go well beyond your cross appeal i mean",
    "there was",
    "statutory arguments that responded and",
    "it absolutely",
    "is better and what i'm trying to and",
    "again",
    "it is because part of our constitutional",
    "argument is the failure to comply with",
    "that statute",
    "also violates due process um i just",
    "briefly i wanted to mention again",
    "that rv was you used your time your you",
    "have no time left",
    "sadness uh yes your honor first i'd like",
    "to point out that",
    "all of the case law um and i think we",
    "can all agree on this",
    "it is only involving that initial",
    "classification hearing under uh 2152.83",
    "and that is what distinguishes here",
    "um that statute specifically says",
    "that the order continues the court's",
    "jurisdiction",
    "to reconsider to to modify",
    "to review that initial classification",
    "of continues beyond the age of 21. so",
    "all of the case law",
    "um is not applicable this really is a",
    "case of first impression when we talk",
    "about the review hearing",
    "and and very clearly this is a review",
    "hearing it's not a new classification",
    "hearing",
    "that the court is not allowed to then go",
    "back and say",
    "oh no you're you're you can either go",
    "down a tier",
    "or not at all um the court couldn't",
    "change the tier to a tier three at that",
    "point so this is not a new",
    "classification hearing it it's",
    "clearly a review hearing and it the the",
    "court i",
    "i think are you saying that the the",
    "judge is limited",
    "as to what the judge will in that",
    "uh hearing a post-disposition",
    "uh cannot relieve the uh",
    "minor of the duty to report yes they can",
    "they can remove they can't foundation",
    "yes they can remove the classification",
    "you're saying they can't go from a one",
    "to a three",
    "right they can't enhance okay right so",
    "so i'd say that whether the",
    "classification",
    "sticks and you've got a duty for",
    "reporting or",
    "the judge can remove it and you are free",
    "of the",
    "uh duty is a pretty important hearing to",
    "have",
    "it is your honor and that's why it's",
    "important for the juvenile",
    "court to to get it right um they they",
    "have",
    "uh and and this is the goes to the",
    "entire purpose",
    "um of the general assembly creating",
    "these layers",
    "um the court this is this is an",
    "individual who committed",
    "some pretty serious sex offenses at the",
    "age of 14 years old",
    "so the juvenile court has another seven",
    "years",
    "um to to deal with this individual",
    "um so it's certainly and there were",
    "multiple layers here he had",
    "um an inpatient treatment program",
    "and i certainly don't think that it",
    "would be at all wise for a court to once",
    "they're",
    "they've they finished that uh that",
    "period of treatment",
    "to to then make the consideration of",
    "whether or not they need to",
    "to to register um later on what what is",
    "prudent here is",
    "is exactly what the court did is let",
    "let's",
    "you know phase back phase back each each",
    "time",
    "you know as to what his disposition is",
    "he gets",
    "put he gets finishes his treatment then",
    "he's on a period of",
    "um monitoring with the electronic",
    "monitoring",
    "than just probation and then ultimately",
    "down to",
    "the non-reporting probation with",
    "monitored time",
    "in encompassed within each step of this",
    "disposition",
    "is the fact that he's supposed to",
    "register and he didn't even do that in",
    "2015 he stopped registering and then we",
    "have an intervening adult",
    "prosecution for that failure to register",
    "which is then",
    "based upon and again that eats up some",
    "more time for the juvenile court because",
    "certainly they're not",
    "in a position to intervene while an",
    "adult um",
    "prosecution's ongoing so i think if we",
    "look and this is a",
    "voluminous record again it spans",
    "multiple years",
    "but everything the court did",
    "was in all respect very",
    "fair um to rb and i think if you look",
    "back at that",
    "in 2014 i think the trial court very",
    "well",
    "or the magistrate very well may have",
    "wanted to consider",
    "that application uh to seal but couldn't",
    "so let's let's start the process that's",
    "what the the court was",
    "at all um every step wanted to to go",
    "ahead and have that hearing",
    "they didn't have to have it at that",
    "moment that thought okay",
    "why don't we bring you in we'll we'll",
    "hold that into disposition or that",
    "completion of disposition hearing um",
    "start start the process",
    "but excuse me for interrupting",
    "the the word that i get concerned about",
    "in your proposition of law",
    "is the word permanent do you really mean",
    "permanent well i think that",
    "um yes for the the fact that we had the",
    "initial",
    "classification here um in most cases",
    "certainly we're not going to stretch",
    "beyond the age of",
    "of 21 unless it's absolutely necessary",
    "i think that that's that's very apparent",
    "from the magistrate very much",
    "wanted to hold the hearing",
    "um before his 21st birthday um that that",
    "was",
    "very that's very clear um in the",
    "transcripts",
    "so i the the word permanent and that",
    "came from",
    "um a dissent that we had from another",
    "first district case",
    "um here that i think that it it",
    "it makes it clearer um to all the",
    "juvenile courts as well as",
    "the appellate court that it's the once",
    "you have that initial classification",
    "hearing",
    "that they do have the ability to engage",
    "in",
    "a meaningful review of the",
    "classification and make sure they get it",
    "right",
    "um that that certainly that that",
    "jurisdiction is going to",
    "um continue on until they can re",
    "reasonably hold that completion of um",
    "disposition review hearing and that's",
    "the reason for the word permanent even",
    "if it's 10 years out",
    "15 years out i mean i i guess there's",
    "there's",
    "got to be something something smaller",
    "than permanent and i think encompassed",
    "within",
    "obviously when we're talking about a",
    "tier one person",
    "that's going to be 10 years yeah so",
    "certainly you know maybe permanent for",
    "his life",
    "no but for that duration of what the",
    "duty lasts",
    "that makes sense i'm sorry i misspoke or",
    "misworded that yeah",
    "thank you for your honor why why do you",
    "believe that",
    "the juvenile court was",
    "divested of jurisdiction while there was",
    "a pending",
    "common police court general division",
    "action",
    "on the failure to report their lateral",
    "they could run laterally i'm sorry i'm",
    "having",
    "trouble hearing i am",
    "curious as to why you believe that the",
    "juvenile court could not handle any",
    "matters while the common police court",
    "general division",
    "had a pending indictment for failure to",
    "report",
    "well i don't think that i i don't know",
    "of any",
    "legal um i just i think that while",
    "during the pendency of that for the",
    "court",
    "to then go and have a hearing that could",
    "affect",
    "um that i don't know that logistically i",
    "don't know how that would",
    "um that would transpire um legally",
    "whether or not",
    "you know they could actually go in and",
    "they're courts of equal jurisdiction",
    "there so i i don't know",
    "legally or technically how that is but i",
    "i just i",
    "i think that again it goes to the",
    "reasonableness that the",
    "juvenile court was operating under in",
    "this case and the fairness",
    "so without the state would ask that this",
    "court reversed the first district's",
    "decision in this matter thank you",
    "thank you",
    "uh miss nessler did you uh reserve time",
    "did i hear",
    "you did your honor um i was out of time",
    "used all your time i'll give you 30",
    "seconds",
    "thank your honor um in this case um the",
    "0.84 hearing",
    "is the of the utmost importance it is",
    "not only the hearing that just",
    "that decides whether or not the penalty",
    "continues but",
    "it decides whether or not that goes into",
    "adulthood",
    "and it's all the collateral consequences",
    "that come and therefore we ask that this",
    "court to hold that in order to have",
    "jurisdiction to continue the",
    "classification",
    "the court must hold the hearing at the",
    "time the child completes the position",
    "and before the child attains age 21",
    "they'd also ask this court to affirm the",
    "first district's decision thank you",
    "thank you you'll take the matter under",
    "advisement you'll be notified i'm",

    "end the matter recent decision hudson uh",

    "district's decision in this case",
    "this court revisited its void",

    "any sentencing issues imposed by a",

    "appeal and therefore they should be",
    "barred by the doctrine of race judicata",
    "since he did not raise this issue on",
    "direct appeal",
    "um so yeah so uh so i believe that",
    "they are barred by race judicata based",
    "on this court's recent jurisprudence",
    "in hudson and harper now even if we were",
    "to get to the substance",
    "of this of this case um the sentence",
    "there is no error",
    "there is no error to appeal for",
    "in in eppley's merit brief eppley",
    "concedes that",
    "sentencing when imposing a sentence a",
    "trial court is not required to",
    "impose make a rote recitation",
    "of the actual statute so long as the",
    "statute complies with the general",
    "assembly's attempt um",
    "the trial court has not substituted its",
    "sentence for the sense of the general",
    "assembly and in this case as i discussed",
    "above",
    "the intent of the general assembly in",
    "this case was for offenders convicted of",
    "aggravated murder",
    "to be had be get a life sentence with",
    "parole eligibility after 20 years",
    "and that's exactly what we have in this",
    "case so the question before this court",
    "regarding the substance",
    "is whether or not there is any sort of",
    "substantive difference",
    "between 20 years to life and life with",
    "parole eligibility after 20 years",
    "and there simply isn't the exact same",
    "sentence well council is there",
    "such a sentence as 20 years to life",
    "not in the statute no that there's",
    "actually no like",
    "it's not a verbatin recitation in the",
    "in the orc the orc says life with",
    "pro-eligibility after 20 years",
    "but 20 years to life is for all intents",
    "and purposes",
    "is the exact same sentence the trial",
    "court was not required to make a verb",
    "voting recitation of the actual statute",
    "um",
    "now i've been asking what is the actual",
    "practical difference between the two and",
    "there is none",
    "um in his merit brief aptly makes the",
    "argument that",
    "by imposing a sentence 20 years to life",
    "the trial court essentially took in",
    "a definite sentence and converted it",
    "into a",
    "indefinite sense and that's simply not",
    "true all one has to do",
    "is look at the definitions in black's",
    "law dictionary of what is a definite",
    "sentence and what is it that",
    "is an indefinite sentence and black's",
    "law dictionary defines a definite",
    "sentence",
    "as a sentence for a fixed length of time",
    "rather than for an unspecified",
    "duration neither one of these sentences",
    "20 years to life or life with pro",
    "eligibility after 20 years",
    "is for a fixed amount of time they're",
    "both life sentences",

    "fact",
    "of these sentences are indefinite",
    "sentences",
    "um black's law dictionary defines",
    "indefinite sentence as a maximum prison",
    "term",
    "that the parole board can be reduced",
    "through statutory authorization",
    "after the inmate has served the minimum",
    "time required by law",
    "therefore they're both indefinite",
    "sentences since they both are",
    "senses of a max of life",
    "that can be reduced once the defendant",
    "serves 20 years now",
    "for years trial courts have been",
    "uh have used these phrases",
    "interchangeably when imposing",
    "a sentence for aggravated murder trial",
    "courts have said",
    "life with pro-eligibility after 20 years",
    "or 20 years to life",
    "when imposing a sentence for murder they",
    "said",
    "15 years to life life with",

    "this sentence the court imposed",
    "20 years to life i mean there's",
    "really never been an issue until",
    "recently in the eighth district",
    "has started starting with their case in",
    "a state versus kemp",
    "and state versus smith they basically",
    "said if the court does not make",
    "essentially follow the verbatim the",
    "statute verbatim",
    "then the sentence is void also as that",
    "has that",
    "uh practice then been adopted uh in your",
    "jurisdiction",
    "uh where judges are more careful in uh",
    "voicing",
    "exactly what the sentence is um i",
    "i would like this i would like to think",
    "so but you still have we still have",
    "situations where",
    "courts still use them interchangeably",
    "it's only been really since the smith",
    "case",
    "that it's really taking on a lot of",

    "aware of",

    "having situations where",
    "they they use them interchangeably you",
    "know",
    "so so that that that's an issue",

    "i would like to think that they are",
    "they've been more cognizant of that but",
    "at the end of the day",
    "like i've been arguing they're the same",
    "sentence one way or the other 20 years",

    "vacate these sentences",
    "a lot of these sentences being decades",

    "profession where words matter",
    "yes whether lawyers judges um",
    "statute drafters words matter",
    "and you know the what",
    "causes me a little concern is that you",
    "said that the",
    "practice in the eighth district given",
    "the cases that have been decided by the",
    "eighth district court of appeals",
    "have not been a cautionary tale for the",

    "sentencing language",
    "well i mean yes i mean that that's an",
    "issue and we are",
    "like as prosecutors when we're in the in",
    "the sentencing uh hearings we're",
    "doing our best we can to well are you",
    "are you in the sentencing hearings at",
    "all times is there a prosecutor present",
    "in the sentencing hearings",
    "uh generally yes especially for",
    "sentences of aggravated murder and",
    "murder",
    "okay and then it would be up to well it",
    "shouldn't be up to but it is a duty of",
    "the prosecutor to make sure the judge is",
    "pronouncing the correct sentence is it",
    "not",
    "exactly yes i agree and they should",
    "follow the pursuant to the",
    "uh the eighth district's um opinions so",
    "yeah that's definitely something that is",
    "a responsibility of the",
    "the prosecutor and when that falls",
    "through the cracks",
    "i mean uh we have to deal with it on",
    "appeal",
    "and my my position is that when that",
    "does happen when a court does",
    "send someone to 20 years to life rather",
    "than life with parole as good after 20",
    "years",
    "it's the same sentence there's no",
    "practical there's no practical",
    "difference between the sentence",
    "is this court held recently in state",
    "versus benella",
    "concerning consecutive sentences this",
    "court",
    "made it clear that talismanic wordings",
    "are not",
    "really necessary at sentencings so long",
    "as",
    "the intent of the legislature is",
    "complied with",
    "the uh so long as the tense of the",
    "legislators complied with the",
    "trial court hasn't substituted its own",
    "sentence",
    "for that of the one provided by the",
    "general assembly",
    "and here 20 years the life in life with",
    "parole eligibility after 20 years",
    "is the exact same sentence there's no",
    "indication of the",
    "trial court like replacing its own sense",
    "with the one provided for by the",
    "uh the legislature um if there's any",
    "other questions i would just uh",
    "ask to save the balance of my time for a",
    "rebuttal",
    "thank you mr martin",
    "made please the court john martin on",
    "behalf of mr dowdy",
    "my friend says there's no difference",
    "two words no difference i have two words",
    "in response and that is to whom",
    "and it's that to whom the fact is that",
    "the question is not whether it makes a",
    "difference",
    "to anybody other than the general",
    "assembly",
    "because this court following its",
    "traditional jurisprudence recognizes",
    "that it is the general assembly that",
    "defines punishment",
    "and so if i may this morning i'd like to",
    "talk about",
    "three things one is there",
    "a statutory extinction between",
    "20 to life and life with parole",
    "eligibility at 20.",
    "second i would like to talk",
    "about whether or not that distinction",
    "implicates void versus voidness",
    "and then third i would like to talk",
    "about the practical effect",
    "the statutory distinction",
    "if we look at 292902",
    "it lays out penalties for murder and for",
    "aggravated murder",
    "and the general assembly says ag murder",
    "either death or life imprisonment",
    "murder 15 to life imprisonment",
    "and then we move over to 29 2903",
    "and it talks about the fact that that",
    "life imprisonment",
    "can come with parole eligibility",
    "but in 2929.03 and we cite the statute",
    "at length and",
    "at pages five and six of our brief and",
    "at 2929.03",
    "c1 a little v",
    "you have a situation where we see that",
    "in first of all in four it says",
    "that when this is dealing with ag murder",
    "where there was a death spec",
    "and the jury comes back without death",
    "and they say that subject to the",
    "following subsection",
    "quote life imprisonment with parole",
    "eligibility after serving",
    "30 full years of imprisonment so that's",
    "one of",
    "the penalties that the general assembly",
    "recognizes",
    "and then in part roman five",
    "little v if you will it goes on and it",
    "talks about the fact that if you have a",
    "victim that's less than 13 years of",
    "age and you have certain uh predator",
    "specs and the like",
    "that the sentence is not that it can't",
    "be",
    "that one it is an indefinite term",
    "consisting of a minimum term of 30 years",
    "and a maximum term of life",
    "so here we have in the exact same",
    "subsection of a single statute the",
    "general assembly using two different",
    "terms",
    "and when the general assembly uses two",
    "different terms",
    "we presume that they have",
    "two different meanings the eighth",
    "district has done nothing but apply",
    "this court's traditional statutory",
    "interpretation jurisprudence in looking",
    "at that and and i might point out that",
    "kemp and i i don't know what this is",
    "worth but",
    "if nothing else anecdotally kemp was",
    "written by judge kenneth rocco",
    "who had himself been a six-year member i",
    "believe or",
    "about six-year member of the general",
    "assembly so we have",
    "a former state representative who's",
    "drawing this distinction between hey",
    "wait a minute",
    "definite indefinite okay now is it a",
    "definite",
    "term if you have life with parole",
    "eligibility",
    "after 30 years or after 20 years in my",
    "client's case",
    "mr zelaznakar does a good job of telling",
    "you that",
    "in black's law dictionary that doesn't",
    "make a difference",
    "but again to whom to the general",
    "assembly this court must presume it did",
    "make a difference",
    "because they used the two terms in",
    "different places now if it makes a",
    "difference to the general assembly",
    "then the next question that comes up is",
    "well what about void and voidness what",
    "am i going to do about the fact that",
    "this court has decided harper",
    "and hudson here's why",
    "harper and hudson are distinguishable",
    "harper and hudson which were both prc",
    "cases",
    "both involved cases where the judge had",
    "the authority to impose",
    "prc did it imperfectly",
    "but nonetheless had the authority to do",
    "that",
    "but in this situation if we recognize",
    "that to the general assembly",
    "life with parole is different than",
    "20 to life then we're in a situation",
    "where",
    "it makes it then the general assembly",
    "has not said the judge can do both it",
    "can",
    "can impose either it's been very",
    "specific as to which one",
    "and i i realize that one of the",
    "questions that comes up is am i just",
    "playing games with talismanic phrases",
    "the answer is no see this isn't a",
    "question of saying you have to use the",
    "exact words",
    "but what you cannot do is to substitute",
    "one legal term for another legal term",
    "and then turn around and say well it",
    "doesn't really make a difference",
    "and therefore all martin's doing is",
    "saying talismanic phrases",
    "no i'm not i'm saying that when words",
    "matter",
    "legal terms that are distinctly used in",
    "different places of a statute",
    "themselves also matter",
    "now if we don't limit",
    "harper and hudson in the manner",
    "that i'm going that i'm for which i'm",
    "advocating",
    "we run into the following problem let's",
    "say that we take",
    "harper and harp and harper does this",
    "wonderful job of taking us all the way",
    "back to",
    "state x-ray and really developing the",
    "whole line of jurisprudence",
    "but in talking about the jurisdiction",
    "of the trial court i think it's",
    "important to remember",
    "and this was not an issue in in harper",
    "or in hudson",
    "that the general assembly when it",
    "confers",
    "jurisdiction on a trial court",
    "it gives it two different lines of",
    "authority",
    "the authority to try the case and the",
    "authority to punish",
    "see it's this authority to punish that's",
    "the problem here for the state of ohio",
    "because the general assembly has not",
    "ordained the trial court",
    "to punish aggravated murder",
    "in this case with a 20 to life it is",
    "only ordained the trial court",
    "to punish with life",
    "with the parole eligibility which in",
    "this case happened to have been imposed",
    "at 20 years",
    "and so when the general assembly uses",
    "two different terms",
    "and then in its conference of",
    "authority to the trial court to go",
    "forward and do our work",
    "it does not give them the authority to",
    "go",
    "beyond those statutory parameters if",
    "that were the case",
    "then we could have the situation where a",
    "common police court judge",
    "who sentences a defendant for",
    "the theft of a loaf of bread is a petty",
    "offense and gives him",
    "20 years and we would say well that's",
    "voidable",
    "and if you didn't catch that in the",
    "general if you didn't catch that in the",
    "journal entry",
    "then in fact it's too bad you're going",
    "to have to do 20 years",
    "on the petty offense and that cannot be",
    "and we know from the line of cases that",
    "harper cites",
    "that are rid of habeas corpus doesn't",
    "lie traditionally",
    "in that kind of a situation well if a",
    "writ of habeas corpus doesn't lie and if",
    "we look at the constitution and the",
    "other ritz that are available",
    "mandamus prosedendo prohibition quo",
    "oronto",
    "none of those fit so there has to be a",
    "way",
    "for the state of ohio to be able to",
    "avoid that type",
    "of injustice and it is through the void",
    "sentence",
    "doctrine used in limited",
    "in in limited doses and that limited",
    "dose",
    "that limited dose comes in saying",
    "trial judge could you have done this",
    "anyway if the answer to that question is",
    "no",
    "then the sentence is void trial judge",
    "could you have done this",
    "but you just did it the wrong way",
    "avoidable",
    "and that's a distinction that allows",
    "harper and hudson",
    "to make great strides for judicial",
    "economy",
    "without violating 14th amendment due",
    "process",
    "so if i could let me move then to my",
    "third point",
    "and my third point is does it make a",
    "difference and i",
    "talked in my brief at the very end",
    "about the idea that it sends a different",
    "message to the parole board",
    "the glass half empty glass half full but",
    "i want to be a little bit more concrete",
    "than that",
    "this morning if i may and no i'm",
    "let me just say right now i haven't",
    "found a place",
    "where somebody's serving 20 to life",
    "is different than life after 20. but",
    "here's what i have found",
    "and i cited a supplemental authority i",
    "gave i",
    "cited to the court state x-ray davis",
    "versus janus and that was a rip case",
    "that you decided back in april",
    "about 20 full versus 20 to life",
    "okay 20 full to life or parole after 20",
    "full versus parole after 20.",
    "those were two different sentences in",
    "that case",
    "correct that that's that's not the",
    "equivalent of what we have here",
    "no it's not your honor and and i want to",
    "make sure that i i",
    "i'm not trying to suggest that but what",
    "i want to point out to the court i used",
    "that case",
    "only to provide the factual background",
    "to look at",
    "some one of the pieces of authority that",
    "was cited by both parties and that was",
    "oac 5120-2-10",
    "and 5120-2-10 gets into the issues about",
    "good",
    "time in those in in and when it's going",
    "to be treated and in 5120-2-10",
    "b it talks about that 20 to life",
    "li and 24 and then it says",
    "and you know from janus that that's a",
    "question that was a matter of a",
    "statutory mandate",
    "that you're supposed to do one in one",
    "place as your honors as",
    "mr justice dewine points out those are",
    "two distinct sentences",
    "and then the but look at what they say",
    "at the very end of that they say look",
    "we're gonna treat any sentence",
    "of uh to aggravated murders we're gonna",
    "presume it to be a sentence of life with",
    "parole eligibility after 20",
    "unless the journal entry says something",
    "different",
    "so we see that the executive branch",
    "is saying look if it's in the journal",
    "entry",
    "we're gonna follow that whether that was",
    "a legal sentence or not all janice did",
    "was to give perspective to what was",
    "being said there",
    "and and the point is this if",
    "the executive branch is going to be",
    "following what the trial court",
    "journalizes what the trial court says",
    "what happens if down the road and this",
    "has not happened yet",
    "but i can't come back to you in 30 years",
    "the good lord willing i could even be",
    "able to",
    "and say to you",
    "my client is not getting good time",
    "and since the time that i was here the",
    "last time your honors",
    "the oac has been changed and there's",
    "good",
    "time in life cases",
    "but there's not good time in cases",
    "involving",
    "indefinite sentences or there's a",
    "different calculation",
    "of good time in one setting versus good",
    "time in another",
    "and it made a difference and so the",
    "problem here is this if the general",
    "assembly is going to use two different",
    "terms",
    "then respectfully we presume they make a",
    "difference",
    "and we see that the executive branch in",
    "the past has said",
    "or present has said we're going to look",
    "at that journal entry",
    "we're not going to look at the statute",
    "we're going to look at the journal entry",
    "and if the judge said it was indefinite",
    "in this case they were talking about 20",
    "like from 20 full but the point being",
    "the oac has shown that the executive",
    "branch will be guided",
    "by the journal entry and if down the",
    "road there are changes if the parole",
    "board takes a different",
    "attitude and says you know when it's 20",
    "to life that's different than life with",
    "parole eligibility after 20.",
    "regardless of which way they they they",
    "have that",
    "arrow point if they say there's a",
    "difference in",
    "if the oac turns around and says we're",
    "going to treat",
    "good time differently and we've got a",
    "journal entry that's wrong",
    "then my client does suffer",
    "so at the end of the day",
    "the general assembly makes the laws they",
    "pick the words",
    "trial judges shouldn't be turning around",
    "and ignoring",
    "one term of art not term of art legal",
    "term",
    "for another legal term and then",
    "we have the fact that the executive",
    "branch",
    "rightfully so looks to a trial court's",
    "journal entry",
    "when it decides how it will enforce the",
    "law",
    "this is not a situation and this is a",
    "situation where",
    "all of this happens where a trial judge",
    "acts without that authority",
    "that has to be conferred by the general",
    "assembly",
    "in the end to whom",
    "is the distinction and this court",
    "employing traditional separation of",
    "powers",
    "should recognize the primordial role",
    "of the general assembly in making the",
    "law if there are no further questions",
    "i thank the court for its time thank you",
    "mr zelen carr you have six",
    "let's see how much longer do you have",
    "four minutes and 19 seconds left",
    "thank you your honor um i'd like to talk",
    "about the janus case because",
    "he brings up a good point in the janus",
    "case",
    "the janus case if you look at paragraph",
    "seven through eight of the janus case",
    "that was the situation",
    "where the trial court by",
    "family by including the term fool",
    "into its term actually changed the",
    "sentence there was an actual substance",
    "change the court recognized that by when",
    "when",
    "the term full is in the sentence it",
    "precludes the defendant from getting",
    "things like",
    "good time credit or joining programs so",
    "that was an actual substantive",
    "difference",
    "what i didn't hear through during his",
    "um argument was how 20 years to life",
    "in life with parole's ability after 20",
    "years are two different sentences",
    "they're just clearly not they might be",
    "phrased differently but they're the same",
    "thing",
    "and if you look at the ohio",
    "administrative code",
    "you'll hide administrative code",
    "recognizes",
    "that like even though a sentence for",
    "murder is 15 years to life",
    "and a sentence for aggravated murder is",
    "life with parole eligibility after 20",
    "years",
    "when you look at the ohio administrative",
    "code under uh",
    "5120-2-10g",
    "which governs murder sentences it states",
    "um a prisoner serving an indefinite term",
    "of imprisonment of 15 years of life for",
    "the offense of murder",
    "becomes eligible for parole",
    "consideration after the 15-year minimum",
    "sentence",
    "now when you look at the ohio",
    "administrative code uh",
    "governing aggravated murder 5120-2-10",
    "k it basically says the",
    "same thing it says a prisoner serving a",
    "sentence of imprisonment for an",
    "offensive aggravated murder committed on",

    "council i recognize that that certainly",

    "is to is to get at the truth",
    "uh but what about uh the other the other",
    "issue that your",
    "friends on the other side ray uh raise",
    "which is to prevent",
    "a flood of follow-on litigation",
    "uh to to give a definite end that that",
    "you shouldn't see",
    "additional liability based on something",
    "that you did in in",
    "one case how do you respond",
    "you're under that is a red herring in my",
    "view because there is no flood of",
    "litigation",
    "for for these issues well would you",
    "agree though that that is one of the",
    "purposes",
    "for the litigation privilege for the",
    "litigation immunity",
    "i would not agree that's a purpose at",
    "all i would agree that that is a benefit",
    "that has been",
    "acknowledged by this court and uh by",
    "other courts around the country",
    "that it would stop litigation but",
    "for the reasons that i'm about to get",
    "into this litigation should not be",
    "stopped",
    "well but that isn't that a different",
    "question i mean what we're",
    "thinking about is really how are we",
    "going to apply this",
    "looking prospectively in every case",
    "rather than",
    "how are we going to apply it in this",
    "particular case",
    "well the first point was it should be",
    "applied in defamation cases",
    "only but if you're going to expand it",
    "beyond defamation cases",
    "then you should use the test that this",
    "court's already enunciated",
    "which is has to be reasonably related to",
    "the litigation",
    "and if it's not then the",
    "privilege could apply and there wouldn't",
    "be any affordable litigation",
    "how could settlement discussions not be",
    "reasonably related to the litigation",
    "because as that term is defined it has",
    "to either prove or disprove",
    "the underlying issue in the lawsuit",
    "settlement discussions nobody admits to",
    "anything in settlement discussion they",
    "don't approve or disprove anything",
    "so as we if you applied this court's",
    "definition",
    "then they would not be covered by the",
    "privilege",
    "thank you secondly your honor",
    "the directors are fiduciaries as a",
    "matter of law to certified steel",
    "the receiver pled that their fiduciary",
    "duties were breached",
    "and this court must assume that",
    "fiduciary duties aren't like a light",
    "switch that get turned on and off",
    "they are unremitting and constant",
    "they do not cease at the courthouse do",
    "door",
    "and finally your honor and my time is",
    "about to run out",
    "providing the absolute meaning here is",
    "unnecessary",
    "because both delaware and ohio recognize",
    "a business judgment rule",
    "that protects decisions by directors",
    "assumes they're made in good faith but",
    "it's a rebuttable presumption",
    "and in egregious cases like this one",
    "that presumption can be rebutted",
    "the appeals court decision here not only",
    "nullifies corporate fiduciary duties for",
    "directors",
    "it also eradicates the business judgment",
    "rule",
    "i would defer to mr brookes lincoln",
    "surfer at this time",
    "council chief justice o'connor and mid",
    "please the court",

    "known as clark dietrich uh i'd like to",
    "take five minutes of the remaining time",
    "without reserving any of that for",
    "rebuttal at justice french i'd like to",
    "start with",
    "with your question to mr helmer about uh",
    "the benefits of",
    "follow-on litigation and i think one of",
    "the responses to that question",
    "is as mr homer said that may be a",
    "benefit of the litigation privilege",
    "but it is it's not a a good way to",
    "define the scope of the litigation",
    "privilege",
    "and that is because there are other",
    "doctrines",
    "that address and solve the problem of",
    "follow-on litigation",
    "within the given context of a particular",
    "tort",
    "in this context of our case that problem",
    "is addressed by the",
    "business judgment rule the presumption",
    "against",
    "second-guessing director decisions",
    "discourages follow-on litigation",
    "and acts to eliminate a lot of such",
    "litigation at a very",
    "early stage when it has not been",
    "discouraged in the first place",
    "other tort theories such as professional",
    "negligence",
    "that might come in this context also",
    "have elements to them that are",
    "make follow-on claims hard in the first",
    "instance and so uh yes it's a it's a",
    "reasonable policy consideration to think",
    "about follow-on litigation",
    "and finality of litigation but we",
    "already have other doctrines that",
    "address that problem",
    "and in grafting that goal onto the",
    "litigation privilege",
    "creates problems it creates problems",
    "because the litigation privilege is an",
    "absolute immunity that prevents even the",
    "inquiry into the underlying conduct",
    "and that fundamentally is the problem",
    "with the 12th district's rule here",
    "and also with the position being",
    "advocated",
    "uh by the defense their rule",
    "would preclude even inquiring",
    "into a breach of fury duty in the",
    "context of litigation",
    "interpreted literally as the descent",
    "below",
    "indicated the 12th district's rule would",
    "preclude",
    "any inquiry even inquiry",
    "into professional negligence claims in",
    "the context of litigation",
    "your honors that can't be the law of",
    "ohio",
    "and it's not the law in other",
    "jurisdictions either",
    "and other jurisdictions have taken three",
    "general approaches to addressing",
    "this kind of issue that is corralling a",
    "litigation privilege that sweeps to",
    "some states and the restatement adhere",
    "to the traditional rule",
    "so that the litigation privilege applies",
    "only to defamation claims",
    "other states have expanded the the array",
    "of",
    "which the privilege applies but they",
    "keep them limited to those that found in",
    "defamation",
    "that is claims alleging a reputable or",
    "psychological",
    "injury arising out of litigation",
    "testimony or evidence",
    "still other states have a broader rule",
    "that's articulated generally for the",
    "privilege",
    "but then carve out exceptions or impose",
    "significantly",
    "limitations on the otherwise broad scope",
    "of their general rule",
    "the most common of those exceptions is",
    "one for professional negligence claims",
    "and that's based on the common sense",
    "idea that the litigation privilege",
    "isn't to prevent a principle from suing",
    "its own",
    "agent for negligence or misconduct in",
    "context of litigation",
    "and that exception provides a very nice",
    "analogy to this case",
    "some other states have carved out other",
    "exceptions to another",
    "rule and have done what the senate judge",
    "below proposed",
    "which is limiting the claims to which",
    "the privilege applies",
    "to those that are brought by a party",
    "opponent",
    "in the underlying litigation and that",
    "kind of exception",
    "also addresses the concern that you",
    "raised just as french",
    "both of those exceptions that states",
    "have carved out to",
    "you know broad general scope definitions",
    "of the litigation privilege",
    "uh exhibit a point that are that's very",
    "relevant here",
    "and that is the litigation privilege",
    "should not be used to deny recourse to a",
    "litigant",
    "who has been wronged by the agent or",
    "representative",
    "of that litigant any of those options",
    "that other states have chosen would",
    "solve the fundamental problem here of a",
    "privilege that sweeps too broadly",
    "we think the one sounding uh limiting",
    "the scope to those",
    "sounding and defamation makes the most",
    "sense your honors for the reasons we've",
    "articulated in the",
    "in our breathe at the end of my time",
    "your honors and i will",
    "yield the balance for mr helmer's",
    "rebuttal",
    "thank you all right all right for the",

    "appear here",
    "for you today i'd like to address two",
    "issues one that the litigation privilege",
    "does apply",

    "go to the business judgment rule",
    "that the receiver has failed to state a",
    "claim",
    "in this regard i'm going to narrow",
    "myself solely to what the receiver",
    "actually pled mr helmer makes additional",
    "arguments today",
    "but i'm going to receive i'm going to",
    "narrow myself to literally what he",
    "played",
    "page 2 paragraph 2 page 6 paragraph 16",
    "what he pleads is that the cssa opposed",
    "a motion to dismiss and instead",
    "insisted upon the having the jury decide",
    "the matter he does that by requesting a",
    "vote",
    "so he's responding to judge faith and by",
    "the way at that time chip and ed",
    "this is chip gardner my client ed slish",
    "koeppelli",
    "were parties they were the cssa a",
    "corporation speaks to its",
    "representatives",
    "and at that point they were responding",
    "directly to a judicial inquiry",
    "and they said we want to have the jury",
    "rule that is absolutely i've just stated",
    "a prima facie case",
    "of the litigation privilege because",
    "they're litigants in the course of a",
    "case",
    "and they're responding to a judicial",
    "question so with regard to wilitzer",
    "which mr helmer grasps onto",
    "bullets here is an odd case because it",
    "deals with a private medical exam being",
    "done",
    "apparently for a labor dispute but the",
    "court there had a 4-3 split it was a",
    "closely decided",
    "divided supreme court of ohio and they",
    "drew the following line",
    "it was an investigative medical function",
    "not a quasi-judicial function",
    "asking for the jury to rule is as close",
    "as you can conceivably get to the",
    "litigation process",
    "mr helmer then argues well",
    "it's a narrow rule it really doesn't",
    "apply here but suraji tells us it's a",
    "liberal immunity",
    "rule of immunity it extends to every",
    "communication at every step in the",
    "course of litigation",
    "complaint to the end further pleadings",
    "and statements and this was a pleading",
    "we want to have the jury rule",
    "is protected perjury is protected",
    "clearly in derogation of the",
    "truth-finding process but this court is",
    "found as others have to and that's",
    "schmidt versus statistics",
    "stole versus kennedy that perjury is",
    "protected",
    "as is bad faith statements so the",
    "narrowing that mr blickensterford and mr",
    "helmer attempt really is not true the",
    "fact is this court has embraced",
    "a broad rule all along mr mr",
    "let me excuse me um let me",
    "let me ask give you this hypothetical",
    "suppose the directors of",
    "procter gamble decide that all this",
    "consumer products",
    "making is too much work and instead",
    "they're going to devote",
    "all their corporations resource to",
    "patent litigation",
    "suit people who they think are breaching",
    "their path their patents",
    "and a few months later they announced",
    "they announced the decision their stock",
    "price plummets",
    "wouldn't would they would they not be",
    "liable",
    "could they not be sued for breach of",
    "fiduciary duty uh",
    "two answers your honor um if you don't",
    "let me change your fact that i'm just",
    "slightly",
    "now just watch answer this fact pattern",
    "let's stick to this one",
    "i like coca-cola which is why i put on",
    "weight but if they tried new coke it was",
    "a horrible disaster",
    "if they came back to new cove or they go",
    "and decide they want to focus on",
    "litigation",
    "there is a great question about whether",
    "they've acted appropriately under the",
    "business judgment rule perhaps if the",
    "stock prices plummet",
    "right the question the question is and",
    "let's go back to my hypothetical these",
    "are this",
    "is i think akin to what we have here",
    "which is a decision",
    "whether or not to continue or pursue",
    "litigation",
    "uh with the directors in that example",
    "under your reading of ohio law would",
    "they be entitled to a litigation",
    "privilege these were",
    "decisions about litigation well i don't",
    "know where they'd be decided",
    "they'd be entitled to litigation because",
    "it's not made",
    "in the courtroom directly related to",
    "litigation is somewhat related as a",
    "business decision business discussion",
    "if we look at the business judgment rule",
    "which would be well",
    "but i think we need to talk about the",
    "privilege though that's that's kind of",
    "the that's the issue we accepted",
    "uh what",
    "you say the difference is that they",
    "weren't in the courtroom in that what",
    "imagine for example uh the directors in",
    "the courtroom",
    "uh they get a very reasonable",
    "settlement offer uh maybe uh",
    "and the directors decide that they've",
    "hired their brother",
    "one of the director's brother-in-law to",
    "continue the litigation",
    "he's making a lot of money uh they don't",
    "they don't want to",
    "accept the excellent offer because they",
    "want him to continue to get paid in this",
    "case",
    "is is there a breach of fiduciary duty",
    "claim there may well be but the",
    "i mean but what's the difference under",
    "your version of the privilege if it's",
    "immune if it immunizes these decisions",
    "whether to accept settlement offers to",
    "go forward with",
    "litigation why would it apply",
    "because in the case where a corporate",
    "board is still informed and makes a bad",
    "decision because it's just not informed",
    "or makes a decision out of bias",
    "and it it's not making it in the court",
    "it's making it in the board room",
    "if you will it's making a business",
    "decision there may well be a breach of",
    "fiduciary duty but no",
    "so it depends on the look how the board",
    "sitting when they make the decision",
    "no but your honor respectfully they were",
    "at six weeks and into a jury trial",
    "they're sitting there on sunday night",
    "they get approached at nine pm",
    "and they have to make a decision as a",
    "board what do we do",
    "they then actually accept the offer the",
    "following day so exactly what the",
    "receiver complains about they then did",
    "that is a little different than coming",
    "up with the idea of selling poison",
    "as a board and deciding you know we're",
    "going to bypass the fda rules",
    "right but but but you're asking us to",
    "adopt a rule that would apply to all",
    "those situations i mean",
    "i'm not respecting your honor give me",
    "the contours of the privilege that you",
    "would like us to",
    "uh i think we fixed glare within",
    "litigation privilege",
    "in this case it was a statement in",
    "response to a court",
    "in the courtroom because their lawyer",
    "was there in the courtroom",
    "they were negotiating in the courtroom",
    "they responded monday morning to the",
    "court",
    "that is very different than some you",
    "know if you will contrive",
    "corporate conspiracy where the",
    "corporations acting in its own",
    "self-interest or bias if you will okay",
    "so",
    "so should should we have a privilege but",
    "not",
    "the reasonably related privilege to the",
    "litigation that the lower court had",
    "i think it has to be reasonably related",
    "saying i want to have the jury rule",
    "is as reasonably related as statement as",
    "you can get",
    "okay but but i was trying to understand",
    "what your standard would be",
    "because we're gonna have to make a",
    "decision if we're going to",
    "have a standard we have to articulate it",
    "so right your honor",
    "my respectful suggestion would have been",
    "and i know it's up to this court",
    "is that the wheels of justice turn slow",
    "but mighty fine",
    "mr blick and stripper throws out and",
    "they've thrown out the idea of",
    "lawyers assaulting judges and you know",
    "people assaulting witnesses",
    "i can't deal with that fact pattern",
    "because right now i'm not asking for a",
    "grand rule i think the dissent got it",
    "wrong here",
    "all the people but do you think the",
    "majority got it wrong because the",
    "majority",
    "articulate a grand rule that would cover",
    "those situations",
    "i think the i think the majority got it",
    "right because they were applying it",
    "to this fact pattern i don't think they",
    "were trying to resolve",
    "a just a rule that applies to every case",
    "everywhere",
    "they the fact pattern they were posed",
    "with was on the eve of trial",
    "litigants decide that they want to have",
    "the jury rule",
    "that's the fact pattern they got they",
    "weren't asked about these other cases",
    "and so to me perhaps it comes with a",
    "different different scenario but",
    "corporation acts in its own",
    "self-interest but the fact is that's a",
    "little different than the fact pattern",
    "we've got and i think the facts make a",
    "difference",
    "does that answer your question your",
    "honor um",
    "not really but i think",
    "i apologize justice i certainly am i'm",
    "trying i'm not trying to avoid your",
    "question",
    "um with regard to the so regarding the",
    "majority rule this majority this court",
    "has filed a majority rule on the",
    "restatement",
    "um ever since 1930 restatement one two",
    "and three",
    "this case falls squarely within three",
    "statement of torts",
    "the purpose here of course is to make",
    "sure that every witness can testify",
    "if we accept the rule that they're",
    "articulating here then the witnesses",
    "would not be able to testify because",
    "everyone will be terrified",
    "if they walk into ohio they're not going",
    "to have both the litigation privilege",
    "and the business judgment rule",
    "nothing requires them to just choose",
    "between the two",
    "lastly as justice francis french noted",
    "the idea is to end litigation not to",
    "promote it",
    "i one last point before i hand off the",
    "baton to scott ratchik and of course i'm",
    "here to answer your questions",
    "looking again at the receiver's",
    "complaint page 8 paragraph 27",
    "page 11 paragraph 42 page 1247 he says",
    "something very specific each time",
    "he says that the cssa members chip and",
    "ed",
    "were acting in the interest of their",
    "member companies as a matter of law",
    "he has just failed to state a claim the",
    "reason is we're governed by delaware law",
    "and delaware law says their duty was to",
    "the member companies to this",
    "if that's the case why wouldn't we just",
    "remand it to the court of appeals to",
    "apply the business judgment rule if",
    "you're correct they would their conduct",
    "would be immunized into the business",
    "judgment rule",
    "well that's certainly one possibility of",
    "justice dewine the",
    "other possibility again i don't think",
    "you even get to the business judgment",
    "rule",
    "because if we accept the proposition",
    "that they were answering a question",
    "from the court as parties and the cssa",
    "was a party and they say we want to hear",
    "the jury rule",
    "then that would render them completely",
    "immunized but if we go back down",
    "certainly if you get to the right now",
    "the court could look at it and say",
    "we look at the complaint he fails to",
    "state a claim",
    "therefore i think the trial court in the",
    "appellate court got it correct",
    "good morning madam chief justice",
    "justices of the court may please the",
    "court my name is scott ratchik and i am",
    "co-counsel for apelli",
    "edward slish justice dewine let me take",
    "up your question",
    "under your hypothetical i would argue",
    "two things one if the decisions",
    "were made outside of the context of",
    "a proceeding meaning before a litigation",
    "was",
    "filed there's case law that suggests",
    "those actions are not protected by the",
    "privilege including for example",
    "woolitzer which suggests that activities",
    "undertaken",
    "before a litigation is filed are not",
    "protected the same is",
    "true in the page capital case if the",
    "actions that you described were taken",
    "in the course and scope of and were",
    "reasonably related to the",
    "active litigation or judicial proceeding",
    "i would argue",
    "your honor that yes the privilege does",
    "apply",
    "so if so if directors are blatantly",
    "self-dealing if they reject to sell an",
    "offer because they want",
    "their brother-in-law's law firm to make",
    "more money",
    "they there's there's there's no",
    "fiduciary claim that can be inserted",
    "against them",
    "your honor and i will answer that",
    "question and then bring us back to these",
    "facts",
    "but under the circumstances that you",
    "just raised there are other alternatives",
    "for recovery",
    "from by that corporation they can go",
    "after the brothers they can",
    "fire the director they can uh",
    "whether or not there are other sanctions",
    "that might be available",
    "uh the answer is they can pursue those",
    "but they can't go after the director for",
    "breaching his fiduciary obligation too",
    "in the context of the litigation",
    "privilege that would be correct your",
    "honor",
    "and but we don't have those facts here",
    "and to reiterate what mr pollock said",
    "we are dealing with these facts here the",
    "rule",
    "may not be a perfect rule but this court",
    "has acknowledged",
    "that it's not a perfect rule and in both",
    "willitzer",
    "and under uh soros in particular",
    "this court has made it very very clear",
    "that conduct which otherwise would be",
    "actionable",
    "is to escape liability because the",
    "defendant is acting in furtherance of",
    "some",
    "important uh social interest",
    "and additionally that although the",
    "result may be harsh in some instances",
    "and a party to a lawsuit may possibly be",
    "harmed without legal recourse",
    "on balance a liberal rule of absolute",
    "immunity is the better policy as it",
    "prevents endless lawsuits",
    "those are the words of this court so",
    "justice dewine while you",
    "posture a hypothetical to us that is",
    "on the extreme edges",
    "i would say that that falls squarely",
    "within the precedent of this",
    "court recognizing that that injustice",
    "may occur in limited situations",
    "just as the appellants suggest",
    "that a ruling in their favor or a ruling",
    "in our favor is going",
    "to create assault and battery in the",
    "courtroom and witness",
    "tampering and all of those things",
    "couldn't we accomplish the same thing",
    "by uh putting this in the context of the",
    "business judgment rule explaining that",
    "well",
    "maybe there's no litigation privilege",
    "the business judgment rule",
    "provides uh broad project protections",
    "for good faith decisions about whether",
    "to continue litigation",
    "you could your honor but that's not what",
    "the",
    "litigation privilege is intended to do",
    "it is intended as justice french alluded",
    "to earlier",
    "to end uh follow-on lawsuits and to",
    "allow",
    "participants in a judicial proceeding",
    "to act and to speak",
    "as zealously as they can",
    "so that and they can do so without",
    "fear of follow-on lawsuits",
    "but this isn't really about speaking",
    "zealously right it's about",
    "it's about the problem i have here is",
    "we're not talking about speaking",
    "zealously in litigation we're talking",
    "about",
    "decisions making",
    "that would ordinarily seem like",
    "fiduciary decisions",
    "but you're going to do a speech in",
    "litigation",
    "well the decisions here were actually",
    "spoken",
    "one the decision almost",
    "yes but how much more communication can",
    "we have",
    "than in this case where they're accused",
    "and i understand my time is",
    "running up if i might uh finish your",
    "question",
    "um the decision",
    "here was that they're being accused of",
    "is opposing a motion to dismiss",
    "and that communication that decision",
    "and that argument to the court is what",
    "is",
    "centrally at issue here uh as mr [ __ ]",
    "alluded to",
    "that's what the cause of action is here",
    "so",
    "i would argue to you where more can you",
    "get either",
    "one a communication two",
    "as just as french alluded to earlier",
    "seeking the truth",
    "how much more truth oriented can you get",
    "than we want the jury to decide",
    "and so justice dewine while i understand",
    "you're looking for a broad rule",
    "i'm not sure that this is the case",
    "that can give you the opportunity for a",
    "broad rule",
    "but what this case does afford you",
    "is an opportunity to properly apply the",
    "litigation privilege",
    "to the facts of this case",
    "where the directors instead of uh",
    "doing any of the parade of horribles",
    "that are noted",
    "simply said to the court we want the",
    "court to decide",
    "they had an independent judge with the",
    "ability",
    "to regulate that courtroom thank you",
    "council",
    "council thank you okay",
    "you've used your time thank you your",
    "honor",
    "all right mr helmer you have uh looks",
    "like a minute and 47 seconds",
    "thank you your honor uh justice dewine",
    "you were told that we failed to state a",
    "claim in this case",
    "and that remaining this case could",
    "solve the problem the problem with that",
    "your honor is the trial court",
    "was specifically asked to rule on that",
    "issue",
    "and did rule on that issue and did",
    "determine the receiver stated a cause of",
    "action",
    "that was not appealed by either these",
    "directors although",
    "they did appeal other issues they didn't",
    "appeal that issue",
    "justice french as to ending litigation",
    "after listening to mr ratchek i'm sure",
    "you're now convinced",
    "that with all these other remedies that",
    "corporate directors would have that he",
    "claims they would have",
    "litigation wouldn't be in it at all it",
    "just would be moved to a different",
    "courtroom",
    "next your honor you were told that this",
    "settlement offer was accepted by",
    "certified steel and if you look in the",
    "brief",
    "you're going to see the only citation to",
    "that is our complaint at paragraph",
    "17. we do not say that because",
    "that's not true finally",
    "this decision was like the procter and",
    "gamble",
    "hypothetical was made in the boardroom",
    "it was made the night before in the",
    "boardroom",
    "that turned down this golden ticket",
    "settlement and as a result",
    "certified steel got hit with a 43",
    "million dollar jury verdict",
    "that it cannot pay it's",
    "the trial judge that handled this case",
    "did supervise it",
    "and he's the one that not only warned",
    "council of their breach of",
    "potential breach of fiduciary duty he",
    "appointed john reister as a receiver",
    "to look into that issue investigated and",
    "litigated",
    "we ask that you reverse the decision of",
    "the court of appeals",
    "thank you thank you gentlemen we'll take",
    "the matter under advisement you'll be",
    "notified of our decision",
    "making honor thank you for your honor",
    "marshall",
    "marshall will you adjourn court please",
    "hear ye",
    "hear ye hear ye this open session of the",
