    "good afternoon everyone",
    "tuesday we talked about",
    "what we think will be our endgame when",
    "we have the vaccine and then enough of",
    "us",
    "have taken it so we get the community",
    "immunity um and the best guess is that's",
    "sometime next summer no one knows",
    "exactly but that's the best",
    "guess of the experts and that day will",
    "come",
    "but today i want to talk uh and examine",
    "exactly where we are",
    "uh as of today in regard to this virus",
    "what the essential facts are",
    "then i would like to briefly talk about",
    "what i believe that we have learned in",
    "the last",
    "seven and a half months",
    "so today october 15th these are the",
    "essential facts",
    "yesterday we reported 2039",
    "cases our record",
    "today we are reporting 2178",
    "cases another record this is in",
    "stark contrast to not too long ago",
    "september 20th barely a month ago we had",
    "762",
    "cases and for some time we were",
    "hovering around a thousand",
    "cases so we've gone up dramatically",
    "in a relatively short period of time",
    "number two in addition to the increased",
    "cases we're seeing more people get",
    "sick enough to be hospitalized",
    "hospitalization of course is is a",
    "lagging indicator",
    "and as more we see more cases we assume",
    "we're going to see more hospitalizations",
    "but already",
    "we're seeing a significant change",
    "on september 20th we had 563",
    "coveted patients in ohio hospitals",
    "yesterday we had 1042",
    "patients covet patients in ohio",
    "hospitals",
    "so it's basically doubled in a short",
    "period of time",
    "number three",
    "today we add 13 new",
    "red counties giving us a total of 29",
    "red counties that represents 65 percent",
    "of the population of the state of ohio",
    "65 percent of us basically two-thirds of",
    "us are now living in red",
    "counties number four in addition to our",
    "29 red counties we also now have",
    "52 counties that are high incidence",
    "counties as of today",
    "and again we'll define what that means",
    "this means the county has more than",
    "100 cases per hundred thousand residents",
    "during the past",
    "two weeks this number is the distinction",
    "that the cdc makes between a county with",
    "a moderately high level",
    "of spread and a high level of spread",
    "so 52 counties high level of spread",
    "we certainly know that a high level",
    "cases in the community means a higher",
    "risk of catching the disease for",
    "for everyone number five",
    "um let's let's before we get to that",
    "let's go",
    "directly eric to the numbers and we'll",
    "start with the days",
    "the summary again as we said",
    "2178 cases our 21 day average is",
    "still there but it certainly is moving",
    "up as these numbers continue to go up",
    "uh reported deaths today five",
    "hospitalizations 108 a little bit over",
    "the 21 day average",
    "icu admissions have jumped rather",
    "dramatically with 43.",
    "let's look at the next slide eric",
    "this is our advisory last week",
    "this is what this date looks like",
    "this week let's go to the next slider",
    "so this is what we're looking at uh",
    "today",
    "and again",
    "the h simply means high incidence so",
    "we're seeing a good part of the state in",
    "red",
    "we're seeing very little the state now",
    "seven counties that are in yellow",
    "let's take a look at the next slide here",
    "uh and this is just putting the high",
    "incidence counties together with the red",
    "counties those are the ones that have",
    "color to them",
    "and again it shows that most of us you",
    "know",
    "live in a high insulin county or and or",
    "a red",
    "a red county let's take a look at the",
    "next linear",
    "this is shows the change uh",
    "and we've taken each week going back to",
    "july 2nd",
    "and shown how many counties were in the",
    "yellow",
    "what percentage were in in the orange",
    "what percentage in",
    "red and so if you flip over to here",
    "you see yellow is very very small",
    "i've got we've got some some of the",
    "orange",
    "and then red is is the biggest uh",
    "much that we have seen it uh it was",
    "fairly high",
    "back on looks like july",
    "16th uh it was fairly high there",
    "there as well let's take a look at the",
    "next slider",
    "uh this is all 88 counties ranked by the",
    "highest",
    "uh occurrence again",
    "we're seeing a number of counties well",
    "over half the counties",
    "that are high high incidence so if you",
    "take down",
    "you go down the first 52 counties or",
    "above that hundred",
    "hundred or above and if you look down",
    "below that you'll see if you look at the",
    "next ten counties they're",
    "they're creeping up on those numbers too",
    "let's go to the next one eric",
    "this is again from the top to to the",
    "bottom",
    "um not all 88 counties we've got i think",
    "20 counties here",
    "and you can see these are all you know",
    "at least two sometimes three",
    "times as much of the high incidence",
    "i want to talk briefly about why the",
    "high incident number",
    "is important in conjunction with our",
    "high",
    "with our public health alert system uh",
    "the two figures the alert system the",
    "color code",
    "color maps as well as the list of high",
    "incidence counties really",
    "work together it's like looking at the",
    "weather report for the day you can't",
    "make your decisions by looking at only",
    "the temperature or the chance of rain",
    "everything",
    "all kind of works together when looking",
    "at the spread of",
    "covet one of the most important factors",
    "is how many cases there are in",
    "a population and you look at that for",
    "the last two weeks so it's not",
    "historical not something happened",
    "through",
    "three months ago it's what's happened in",
    "the last two weeks",
    "so we can think of this like the",
    "temperature for the day uh it's",
    "your most important number for knowing",
    "what you need to wear if you're going",
    "outside so it tells you",
    "you know how much spread you have in",
    "your county",
    "uh again liking it to weather the",
    "temperature tells you a lot about the",
    "weather in a day but it doesn't tell you",
    "if it'll be windy rainy snowy humid in",
    "the future",
    "so we should think of the advisory",
    "system that map system",
    "as the rest of these factors all put",
    "together and some of them frankly are",
    "early warning",
    "signs the advisory system",
    "your county's particular color combines",
    "several other measures like the number",
    "of people going",
    "to the doctors for covert or the number",
    "of patients in your hospitals",
    "with coven cases per capita are",
    "incredibly important for understanding",
    "how much spread and",
    "potential spread there is in the",
    "community an advisory system is another",
    "layer of information",
    "it's like looking at the temperature",
    "then also getting an alert for strong",
    "winds in the area",
    "but here's the difference the difference",
    "is we can't generally change the weather",
    "we can't change the weather but we can",
    "change the outcome",
    "and so these are reflection of what we",
    "see today but also a reflection of early",
    "warning signs",
    "but we can change the ultimate outcome",
    "uh down the road by what we do what we",
    "do today",
    "let me also talk about a couple other",
    "numbers",
    "our positivity number today is 5.4",
    "and our seven-day moving average is 4.2",
    "during the third week in september our",
    "positivity number was 2.7",
    "uh this simply means that the percentage",
    "of our test coming back",
    "positive has more than doubled",
    "uh this is very important uh as we see",
    "tests go up we would expect to see some",
    "more cases",
    "but what we really then have to look at",
    "is positivity and what we should be",
    "seeing is a decrease in positivity as",
    "the testing goes",
    "dramatically up instead of that we're",
    "seeing",
    "not a decrease in positivity we're",
    "seeing a very very significant",
    "increase so in summary at this point we",
    "have 70 counties 70 of already",
    "counties that are either red or high",
    "incidents that's 10 million ohioans or",
    "85 percent of the population",
    "live in an area with a high risk of",
    "community",
    "transmission",
    "i want to review uh because we've not",
    "done this for some time and because so",
    "many ohioans are now living in a red",
    "county i want to review",
    "go through and look at the indicators",
    "indicator one is called new",
    "cases per capita the indicator is",
    "flagged if there are greater than 50",
    "cases per 100 000 residents over the",
    "last two weeks",
    "this allows for counties with different",
    "population sizes to be appropriately",
    "compared",
    "this is what we've been saying is our",
    "temperature and the weather report is",
    "very important but it's not the whole",
    "picture",
    "indicator 2 is sustained increase in new",
    "cases",
    "this is an indicator this is an early",
    "warning sign",
    "this is flagged if there is an",
    "increasing trend",
    "at for at least five consecutive",
    "straight days in overall cases by onset",
    "date over the last three weeks this",
    "reflects disease spread",
    "in the population indicator three is",
    "proportion of cases not in congregate",
    "setting again what this is trying to",
    "simply determine",
    "uh is if more than half your cases are",
    "not a congregate setting that tells us",
    "there is spread",
    "clearly out in the community indicator 4",
    "is sustained increase in emergency",
    "department",
    "ed visits for covet-like illness this is",
    "flagged if there's an increasing trend",
    "of at least five consecutive days",
    "in either the number of visits to the",
    "emergency department with covalent",
    "illness or",
    "a diagnosis over the last and this is",
    "all over the last three weeks it",
    "provides information on the health care",
    "seeking behavior of the population and a",
    "sense of how concerned residents are",
    "about their current health status and",
    "the virus",
    "indicator five sustained increase in",
    "outpatient visits for covet-like illness",
    "this is flagged",
    "where there is an increasing trend of at",
    "least five consecutive days in the",
    "number of people going to a",
    "health care provider with cova symptoms",
    "who then",
    "receive a coveted confirmed diagnosis or",
    "a suspected diagnosis",
    "and again over the last three weeks so",
    "this indicator requires some kind of",
    "diagnosis from a doctor rather than just",
    "a patient reporting covet-like symptoms",
    "in addition to providing information on",
    "how concerned residents are about code",
    "it also gives us an",
    "early indicator of health care use for",
    "covert",
    "indicator 6 a sustained increase in new",
    "covert hospital admissions",
    "this is flagged when there is an",
    "increasing trend at least",
    "five consecutive days in the number of",
    "new hospitalizations due to covert",
    "and this again is over the last three",
    "weeks this informs us of the burden on",
    "the hospital system",
    "and disease severity and as a sign the",
    "storm clouds are gathering",
    "uh in fact that it's it's coming um",
    "we could be in for a very very heavy",
    "heavy storm",
    "uh as you recall uh this",
    "indicator uh has to do with",
    "uh europe uh",
    "because people end up many times in",
    "regional",
    "hospitals that is that is indicated",
    "indicator six intensive care unit bed",
    "occupancy",
    "is flagged if both the percentage of the",
    "occupied icu beds in each region goes",
    "above",
    "80 for at least three days in the last",
    "week and more than 20 percent of icu",
    "beds are being used for covet",
    "19 positive patients for at least",
    "three days in the last week",
    "there are four of these indicators that",
    "are typically present",
    "for our red county so far this is what",
    "our",
    "weather forecast looks like two",
    "indicators are present",
    "in all of these 29 counties indicator 1",
    "which is new cases per capita an",
    "indicator 3",
    "proportion of cases not in congregate",
    "setting",
    "indicator 2 sustained increase in new",
    "cases is flagged in 22 of our 29",
    "counties an indicator 5 sustained",
    "increase in outpatient visits is present",
    "in 23 of the 29 counties",
    "both of these mean we're seeing the",
    "weather start to turn in these counties",
    "it's again an early early indicator",
    "um",
    "indicator 4 sustained increase in",
    "emergency visits is flagged by 10 red",
    "counties an indicator",
    "6 sustained increase in hospital",
    "admissions is flagged",
    "by just three of the red counties",
    "again unlike the weather we have the",
    "ability to to control this but this is",
    "where we are",
    "are today",
    "we have as i said 13 new red counties",
    "today new red counties",
    "i want to talk a little bit about what",
    "we are seeing in the data and what we're",
    "hearing from the health commissioners in",
    "regard to those counties",
    "almost to a person our local health",
    "department officials have told us we",
    "this week that our schools are doing a",
    "very good job",
    "but what they are seeing is spread",
    "sometimes connected with the schools",
    "in social gatherings but not officially",
    "connected",

    "friends and family",
    "um as one health commissioner said",
    "people are complacent in places where",
    "they're",
    "comfortable that's human nature and",
    "we've talked about this before but what",
    "we're seeing many times is people who",

    "what we'll continue to learn um",
    "the message you know is the same stay",
    "home when you're sick",
    "keep your distance wear a mask",
    "wash your hands uh let's turn to",
    "a couple of health care care providers",

    "read an article",

    "okay let me um we'll",
    "hold up uh there um",
    "let me go to dr david margolius",
    "is the division director of internal",
    "media medicine at",
    "metro health system um",
    "doctor i know you're seeing a lot of",
    "patients and maybe you could tell us a",
    "little bit about",
    "what you're seeing as far as your",
    "patients and maybe",
    "what they have kind of collectively told",
    "you and what you've discerned",
    "obviously not telling us what any one",
    "patient told you but what have you kind",
    "of learned",
    "uh in your in your job uh in dealing",
    "with covid patients",
    "sure well thanks governor dewine really",
    "getting your message this morning",
    "meant a lot to to all of us at metro",
    "health",
    "who have been caring for people with",
    "covet and people who are worried about",
    "getting coveted for the last six months",
    "so i really appreciate that",
    "so i'm the director of the covet hotline",
    "here and",
    "um just like the rest of the state um",
    "we've seen",
    "sort of waves of of of increasing",
    "concern",
    "um come and go and we've had a couple",
    "good months where where we were",
    "averaging about 50 calls a day",
    "uh that resulted in doctor visits on the",
    "phone",
    "but for the last couple weeks those",
    "those calls have doubled and",
    "the folks that i speak to who test",
    "positive it's a pretty similar theme",
    "it's it's they've spent time with",
    "friends family",
    "indoors without masks and so it's a",
    "pretty common theme i think it's",
    "human nature just like you said to to",
    "want to spend time with people",
    "and and i my message today is it is okay",
    "to spend time with people",
    "but it doesn't have to be a binary",
    "decision it doesn't have to be",
    "yes or no if you do spend time with",
    "people which you should",
    "wear a mask try and be outside try and",
    "be six feet apart",
    "and if you do those things chances are",
    "that it would be really",
    "really unlikely to get kova 19 if you're",
    "wearing a mask you're keeping your",
    "distance and",
    "and you spend as much time as possible",
    "with others outside",
    "doctor how many how many first of all",
    "thank you for what you do",
    "thank you know everyone metro uh",
    "who's dealing with covet patients and",
    "this has been a long seven and a half",
    "months i know",
    "so we're very very grateful for what you",
    "all do",
    "how many patients do you think you may",
    "have talked to",
    "uh during this epidemic as far as",
    "you know people who had covet you know",
    "roughly",
    "yeah roughly i would say um",
    "a couple people a day uh for",
    "probably over 200 people who've had it",
    "who've been diagnosed",
    "in yesterday's cleveland.com",
    "they quote you saying i think more and",
    "more people are getting together",
    "some of this is happening because",
    "there's this urge this human",
    "nature to get back to normal life i",
    "think that's part of",
    "what has been driving these surges um",
    "and then you say later on your quote is",
    "saying we just need these constant",
    "reminders",
    "uh that's still very much out there",
    "it's not not going away and so i guess",
    "you're",
    "you're really talking about human nature",
    "we all want to be together with family",
    "we all want to be together with friends",
    "um and and it sounds like your message",
    "is you can still do a lot of this but",
    "you just got to be really careful is",
    "that",
    "is that is that kind of your bottom line",
    "yeah that's the message",
    "i think you know it's a harm reduction",
    "mentality it's it's if you're going to",
    "spend time with people",
    "spend time safely um you know look look",
    "at coach kevin stevansky of the browns",
    "you know when he wears that mask it's",
    "it's it's there he's doing it i think",
    "many other examples exist where you",
    "really can",
    "be around other people and you can do it",
    "safely and i think",
    "what i worry about is it's like folks",
    "who break their diet",
    "you know if you break your diet and have",
    "one cheeseburger",
    "or one candy bar you know it's probably",
    "going to be okay",
    "but if you break your diet and it's like",
    "you know cheeseburger every day",
    "that's really going to hurt you and so",
    "it's the same thing with with",
    "covenanting i mean you can really",
    "be around other people but do it safely",
    "so avoid",
    "big crowds if you do spend time inside",
    "with others",
    "just everybody should wear a mask and",
    "and hopefully we'll become more and more",
    "comfortable with",
    "reminding each other that you know i",
    "think at the beginning it was a",
    "uncomfortable conversation to say to",
    "someone hey you know your mask is",
    "you know not quite covering your nose",
    "you know get that up but i think if we",
    "really share this mentality that we're",
    "all in this together we're doing this",
    "for",
    "our kids so our kids can be in school",
    "and and our grandparents can stay",
    "safe you know and our relatives can stay",
    "safe and so",
    "we're all in this together the masks",
    "have gotten a lot more comfortable",
    "over the last seven months you know",
    "there are a lot more colors and such to",
    "choose from and i i really think we can",
    "do this",
    "but what we've seen is this roller",
    "coaster of all right",
    "i haven't you know heard anyone in a",
    "while anyone i know getting covered 19",
    "so maybe it's kind of gone maybe i can",
    "go back to doing what i was doing before",
    "or doing the things that i did last year",
    "at this time",
    "but it's still here we're not",
    "an island like new zealand where we can",
    "stop new cases from coming",
    "in and so we do have to adjust to this",
    "new normal and that means spending time",
    "with each other",
    "safely that's great i",
    "i read an article last night",
    "and i want to read you a quote um",
    "because i i thought this summarized it",
    "at least from what i've been able to",
    "learn uh fairly well uh",
    "kind of what we have learned over the",
    "last seven half months",
    "and and here's the quote cover 19 is",
    "airborne over dispersed and often",
    "uh asymptomatic that means it spreads",
    "mostly through",
    "tiny spray droplets commonly produced by",
    "people talking loudly in crowded",
    "unventilated spaces over long periods",
    "leading to super spreading clusters",
    "where one sick person infects many",
    "healthy people",
    "that account for a large share of total",
    "infections infected people without",
    "symptoms might also be",
    "super spreaders i don't know if you is",
    "that a",
    "fair summary do you think or do you want",
    "to add anything to that",
    "yeah no i think that that covers it i",
    "mean i you know i i",
    "on behalf of the the medical community",
    "i'm sorry that we didn't know",
    "more about universal masking in march",
    "you know we didn't know it's not",
    "something that that we learned in our",
    "training",
    "it's not um we i wish we had remembered",
    "more from the 1918 influenza pandemic",
    "but it wasn't something we learned about",
    "and we know",
    "so much more now you know in in",
    "october we know about masks working",
    "it doesn't mean that everybody has to",
    "wear an n95 mask i mean",
    "all it takes is this cloth mask to",
    "prevent that type of spread that you're",
    "describing",
    "well doctor again thanks to you and",
    "everybody at metro for",
    "all you do and thanks for uh being in",
    "our press conference today",
    "i appreciate it very much thank you my",
    "pleasure",
    "we'll go back now",
    "let me go go to dr dreher again medical",
    "director of population health",
    "innovation institute at metro health",
    "system",
    "uh doctor we hope we can hear you now",
    "can you hear me now we can we can hear",
    "you now",
    "we can't we can indeed um you know we're",
    "seeing a",
    "this increase in covet cases in ohio i",
    "don't know whether",
    "i went through the data you're very",
    "familiar with the data",
    "um what's your take on this and and you",
    "know from kind of the big",
    "picture what should what should ohioans",
    "take away from",
    "this data i think they should by the way",
    "yeah we we watch it all the time uh in a",
    "different view the elephant than your",
    "team watches the governor",
    "but same messaging and first message is",
    "ohio knows how to do this it's been",
    "amazing when we have watched this since",
    "march and been scared since marston saw",
    "it but",
    "i mean there was times that that other",
    "states similar to us were 10 times the",
    "infection rates than we were we know how",
    "to do",
    "this and it's the basic stuff it's it's",
    "staying mask",
    "it's saying social distance it's washing",
    "your hands it's disinfecting everything",
    "that hasn't changed i mean like david",
    "said we",
    "we kind of had a little misunderstanding",
    "in march and then the mass thing got",
    "clear and now that's clearly a big deal",
    "we actually look at the data a little",
    "different than you",
    "because the strength point to us is the",
    "hospitalization rate",
    "yes the case rate is kind of a lead",
    "indicator but the true rate is",
    "hospitalization because we admit",
    "people the same way in april as we do",
    "now so it's a pretty consistent number",
    "if the hospitalization rate is going up",
    "the disease burden from covet in ohio is",
    "going up so",
    "in very short order ohioans know how to",
    "do this",
    "they can do it again we want to",
    "encourage you to do it again",
    "all of us do together we are all in this",
    "together but the other thing i want the",
    "message is",
    "when the beds start disappearing from",
    "covid they disappear for every disease",
    "and it makes everybody unsafe even if",
    "you happen to have covet and even if you",
    "had immunity if all this happens",
    "you don't have a bet for your heart",
    "attack for your stroke for your",
    "pneumonia",
    "so it is it is a universal thing so i",
    "just want to emphasize that and",
    "i people ohio has done it we know how to",
    "do we need to do it again",
    "well thank you very much for the message",
    "and and and doctor",
    "again thank you for all that you you",
    "have been doing",
    "uh everybody at metro um i i want to be",
    "clear because i will get some questions",
    "in a minute uh we're not saying that",
    "hospitals are overflowing at this point",
    "um right absolutely not no we are",
    "we are all in good shape and we have",
    "planned a b and c",
    "you know from the leadership of the",
    "government from the leaders of other",
    "healthcare institutions and we are all",
    "working together",
    "we're fine this moment but we are paid",
    "to be paranoid as doctors",
    "and we are worried about plan a b and c",
    "so but we are good right this moment",
    "but but we want to stay good by people",
    "doing the",
    "thoughtful thing okay very very good",
    "well anything else you'd like to share",
    "with us we just appreciate uh",
    "your your time very very much and",
    "appreciate yeah the one last thing that",
    "we want to say though",
    "is um you know herd immunity is sort of",
    "a good thing but herd immunity really is",
    "more defined",
    "by in our standards is mostly from",
    "vaccines in other words when there's a",
    "hurt immunity",
    "you know part of it is from people",
    "getting a disease and then they're",
    "immune",
    "but the bigger part of it is the vaccine",
    "you don't want to do hurt immunity by by",
    "exposing people to the disease alone",
    "that that just increases the number of",
    "deaths so we are strongly supportive",
    "of vaccine-driven herd immunity",
    "and that we don't have that yet you know",
    "so i know it's a confusing message to",
    "different people but we just know from",
    "the medical community",
    "i want you to know herd immunity really",
    "is we wanted to be a vaccine-driven",
    "human immunity not a disease exposure",
    "one so we just want that message out",
    "there too",
    "well and look none of us know at least i",
    "don't know",
    "um you know when that's coming but we're",
    "we're hopeful",
    "and we're hopeful when we get into next",
    "year at some point we are",
    "you know able to first take care of the",
    "most vulnerable and",
    "first responders and then as more comes",
    "out",
    "you know achieve whatever level we need",
    "to achieve",
    "in in society so at that point you and i",
    "will be talking i hope about uh you know",
    "encouraging people to get to get their",
    "shots and get",
    "immunization so that'll be a happy uh",
    "it'll be a much happier uh",
    "uh time so doctor thank you again very",
    "very much",
    "appreciate it",
    "let me just a little bit let me at this",
    "point let me go",
    "let me go to lieutenant governor i know",
    "john has some",
    "things john hi governor",
    "uh yes because everybody knows what",
    "today",
    "is today is the last day to fill out the",
    "census",
    "uh our our time has drawn to a close for",
    "the 2020 census",
    "we need to get you counted today's the",
    "last day to do it",
    "uh it determines how 675 billion dollars",
    "in federal funds",
    "uh are spent and and what portion of",
    "that comes back to ohio",
    "this is for schools hospitals public",
    "roads",
    "and public safety and bridges things",
    "like that",
    "and it also could determine our",
    "political voice in washington whether we",
    "lose a congressional seat or not so",
    "all very important if you want to fill",
    "out your census form",
    "uh and be counted just like we're going",
    "to be counted in our vote we want to be",
    "counted in the census",
    "uh 2020 2020census.gov 2020census.gov or",
    "844 330-2020",
    "for more information and i'll just close",
    "with this",
    "humorous thought that statistically",
    "speaking",
    "you don't exist unless you fill out the",
    "census so",
    "i hope i hope everybody will do that",
    "and help ohio have a bigger presence",
    "in this country by your presence in the",
    "census",
    "uh and then i know",
    "that covid sometimes makes us feel like",
    "there are",
    "all kinds of problems out there and and",
    "i know it can",
    "can wear on us and we do like to",
    "highlight the people who are going above",
    "and beyond the call and really making",
    "things",
    "better for all of us and one of the",
    "groups of people that do that are child",
    "care centers we know",
    "that in when the virus came that there",
    "was a lot of questions about how to do",
    "it safely",
    "many child care centers stepped up and",
    "did a wonderful job to",
    "help moms and dads go back to work",
    "especially those essential workers",
    "and and to give them the peace of mind",
    "that not only were their children going",
    "to be safe but they were actually going",
    "to learn",
    "and grow and develop in that setting and",
    "we want to highlight",
    "one particular child care center the",
    "children's discovery",
    "center in lucas county who really",
    "stepped up during this",
    "time frame to to keep their side their",
    "class sizes low by",
    "by hiring new people and putting every",
    "single protocol in place that others",
    "learn from",
    "to keep the environment there safe",
    "when many schools were closing and going",
    "to remote learning the children's",
    "discover",
    "children's discovery set up a virtual",
    "learning space for kids",
    "to come while their parents work and",
    "they also assign teachers to help",
    "students with their schoolwork",
    "again one example of many",
    "who went above and beyond to make sure",
    "that child care worked",
    "that children were being served that",
    "moms and dads could go to work",
    "and just this is a little part of how we",
    "all chip",
    "in do a little bit extra uh to help us",
    "all get through this and we thank",
    "children's discovery center and all",
    "those",
    "child care centers out there who are",
    "doing that and then i'll close with this",
    "thought we talked about mom and dad",
    "going back to work",
    "we know that that there's still a high",
    "unemployment rate in ohio",
    "but i want to reassure folks there are",
    "opportunities out there",
    "on ohio means jobs alone there are 158",

    "how we can move forward",
    "back to you governor thank you very much",
    "we'll",
    "go to questions",
    "governor first question today is from",
    "spencer hickey at hannah news service",
    "thank you governor on last thursday",
    "you announced a new order on a nursing",
    "home indoor visitation",
    "and i was just wondering if you could go",
    "over the details of that",
    "given that it was kind of mentioned",
    "towards the end and",
    "don't think it had been discussed too",
    "much i know some facilities have opted",
    "not to open for indoor visits yet",
    "yeah i will i will do the best i can",
    "but for a more accurate rendition",
    "people should look at our web page where",
    "we we specifically",
    "outline it the goal",
    "has been to try to safely",
    "have people in nursing homes have",
    "visitors and",
    "it's been one of the most heartbreaking",
    "things frankly that's occurred we closed",
    "the",
    "nursing homes to visitors early early on",
    "when the virus was coming in we did that",
    "to save lives",
    "but we also know there's been a lot of",
    "agony because of that when people can't",
    "see their family",
    "so we went to outdoor visitation when",
    "the weather was better",
    "and when we did that we're moving from",
    "there",
    "now to to indoor visitation um",
    "and a lot of it is within the discretion",
    "of the nursing home they have to be able",
    "to have the people that",
    "are necessary to do this but we",
    "encourage all the nursing homes to you",
    "know make",
    "make a provision for this to be done so",
    "that people can visit",
    "their family members uh it's you know",
    "it's very very very important and i'll",
    "i'll um we'll get you",
    "i'll get you the next time and i'll just",
    "read the specific",
    "uh details but it was worked out along",
    "with the nursing homes",
    "um and the whole whole idea is to",
    "open it up but do it in a in a safe way",
    "and that's our constant constant",
    "challenge as we",
    "as we do these things",
    "next question is from andy chow at ohio",
    "public radio and television",
    "andy hi governor um i'm wondering if you",
    "could talk a little bit more about",
    "testing it seemed like last week the",
    "state was averaging about",
    "40 000 tests a day but seems to have",
    "dropped off in numbers as",
    "far as we can tell from the dashboard is",
    "there an effort by the state to try to",
    "ramp up testing again to encourage",
    "people",
    "to to get testing as a more of a",
    "preventive measure",
    "yeah you know we now",
    "uh are in the process of dispersing",
    "uh 228 000 i think was the figure",
    "uh of the new test from the white house",
    "these the strip tests",
    "and we've kind of outlined how those are",
    "going to be utilized they're going to be",
    "used to some extent our nursing homes",
    "we'll try to we're going to use them",
    "some of our colleges are going to use",
    "them as well",
    "to ramp up their testing capacity",
    "we're also going to use those tests um",
    "in",
    "other areas where if we see a surge we",
    "see a problem",
    "uh develop we'll be able to move in with",
    "those tests so",
    "you're going to see these numbers go up",
    "just because of those alone",
    "we've also got other things that are",
    "going on",
    "where we're going to continue to see the",
    "testing go up so",
    "i think i don't know the exact average",
    "andy for the last seven days but our",
    "last 10 days but",
    "you know we're significantly higher than",
    "we were we've sort of hit a plateau now",
    "we've got to kick it to kick this thing",
    "up again",
    "and continue the the testing so we're",
    "gonna",
    "we are focused on more and more and more",
    "testing faster we can get it out and we",
    "can get",
    "out in in in the correct way uh we're",
    "going to use that i mean it's going to",
    "for example in the nursing homes",
    "it's going to significantly increase the",
    "how often",
    "for example we are testing employees",
    "it's going to increase uh and allow",
    "ohio to comply with what what the",
    "guidelines are from the federal",
    "government is if you",
    "get a case what you have to do and",
    "federal government",
    "provides for very intensive testing",
    "after that until you clear out there's",
    "no cases left",
    "and we're fine with that we're going to",
    "deploy a lot of these tests",
    "to do that so you're going to see the",
    "numbers go up",
    "next question is from jeff redick at",
    "wsyx",
    "in columbus afternoon governor",
    "uh preface this by acknowledging what",
    "you had said",
    "uh last week that the future of the",
    "state's economy will depend on people's",
    "confidence to go out or not",
    "but on last thursday",
    "you had said we're not going to shut",
    "down this economy again we're not",
    "then on tuesday you were asked about",
    "could there be any more lockdown",
    "measures this winter and you said yeah",
    "there could be",
    "will you commit to not authoring any",
    "other",
    "state ordered shutdowns or lockdown",
    "measures or are you not making that",
    "commitment",
    "no thanks for the question i'll try to",
    "clarify it",
    "um we don't have any plans to do",
    "shutdowns",
    "uh but no governor can stand up here",
    "during a pandemic",
    "and and you know say under no",
    "circumstances will we",
    "shut something down and that just that",
    "would be irresponsible we have no plans",
    "uh to shut anything down we believe",
    "as you heard from the from the doctors",
    "uh",
    "that there is a safe way to do most of",
    "the things that we",
    "as ohioans want to do and we just ask",
    "people to do those",
    "uh look what you're seeing in today's",
    "numbers",
    "should",
    "get our attention there's a red tide",
    "flowing all over the state of ohio",
    "and virtually everybody in ohio is now",
    "living",
    "in in a high incident uh",
    "high rate of spread area and",
    "that's something that we can do",
    "something about though it is not",
    "inevitable",
    "this spread of the virus in ohio can be",
    "slowed down it can be reversed",
    "it's totally within our hands to do it",
    "we have the ability to do it",
    "distancing wearing a mask",
    "when you're inside you know make sure",
    "that you're getting some air from the",
    "outside",
    "in and these are wash your hands these",
    "are",
    "basic things as the doctor said a moment",
    "ago",
    "from metro most things we can do",
    "i mean people talking about thanksgiving",
    "if you're going to do it safely you're",
    "probably not going to do it exactly like",
    "you've done it before but you can still",
    "do",
    "something you can still you know have",
    "friends uh but you're gonna have to do",
    "it differently",
    "yeah if we're gonna be safe and and",
    "that's",
    "you know when we look at these numbers",
    "um this is the worst situation ohio has",
    "been",
    "in and more ohioans are vulnerable today",
    "than ever before because of how far the",
    "spread has",
    "has gone there are very few ohioans who",
    "can say wow",
    "i live somewhere where there's no you",
    "know there's no covet and",
    "there's no spread and as",
    "was indicated doctor indicated",
    "we've learned a lot you know we've",
    "learned a lot the medical community has",
    "learned a lot in the last seven and a",
    "half months",
    "we have always tried to tell people what",
    "we knew",
    "but doctors were telling us medical",
    "experts were telling us but they have",
    "learned",
    "and as they have learned we have tried",
    "to continue to you know",
    "keep people informed so we can",
    "live our lives safely schools can stay",
    "open but it's pretty hard to keep",
    "schools open",
    "when you had massive spread of the covet",
    "in your community",
    "no matter how good those schools are",
    "those teachers are",
    "superintendent principal no matter how",
    "hard they're working to keep their kids",
    "safe if it's out in the community it's",
    "going to get in the school",
    "same way with nursing homes you know it",
    "comes from the community",
    "uh and if we can lower that rate in the",
    "community we lessen the chance that gets",
    "into our nursing homes",
    "so it's these are things that we can do",
    "these are things that we can do we got",
    "to be careful",
    "but we can do them",
    "next question is from ben schwartz at",
    "wcpo in cincinnati",
    "hi governor a large er yeah a large",
    "number of",
    "ohioans in the tri-state area and around",
    "cincinnati have to travel",
    "to indiana for work every day yesterday",
    "the ohio department of health put out an",
    "advisory asking",
    "ohioans to self-quarantine after",
    "visiting states with a 15 percent covet",
    "positivity rate or above",
    "indiana is one of those states so what",
    "should ohioans who have to travel to",
    "indiana or other states like that",
    "regularly",
    "what should they do in this situation",
    "yeah ben",
    "even even when we had uh our more",
    "stringent",
    "order early on uh we certainly made",
    "exceptions for people who are commuting",
    "to work",
    "people traveling back and forth now that",
    "we have a",
    "state that's on our border that has that",
    "high incidence",
    "it mostly serves really as a warning",
    "uh and you know if you look at the",
    "counties that border",
    "indiana they're also some of our highest",
    "uh positivity counties and highest",
    "incident counties",
    "uh but we just we put this out uh to",
    "tell people if you're going in",
    "any of these states it's above 15",
    "positivity you should know that",
    "and you should you know adjust your",
    "behavior accordingly it just simply",
    "tells you that there is significant",
    "spread very significant high spread",
    "in in that particular state so again",
    "like",
    "our color code it is a warning",
    "it is a caution that's really what it's",
    "for",
    "next question is from jim province at",
    "the toledo blade",
    "thanks again governor i appreciate this",
    "um it's been three months to the day",
    "since you held your special televised",
    "address to ohioans to urge them to wear",
    "masks",
    "and to practice social distancing and",
    "that was",
    "after ohio hit another infection record",
    "and before you and it also came before",
    "you issued a statewide mass order",
    "what does it say about our progress that",
    "we've been that we're back in this",
    "position again",
    "in october well it means people are",
    "tired they're sick of the",
    "the sick of the virus and they want to",
    "get on with their lives and and i get it",
    "but i i think you know that the history",
    "that you just described is very",
    "instructive",
    "because three months ago i gave the",
    "speech and then",
    "after that we started putting orders on",
    "in regard to masked worry very",
    "controversial a lot of people still",
    "upset about it i understand that",
    "but here's what we found uh we found",
    "what we thought we would find",
    "and that is when those orders went on",
    "people started wearing their masks more",
    "and initially jim when those were put on",
    "those were mostly urban",
    "counties that were red and those urban",
    "counties",
    "very quickly went from a compliance",
    "maybe an average of 50 55 percent to",
    "maybe 85 percent",
    "when that compliance rate went up we",
    "started seeing cases",
    "then after that start to go back down",
    "and so ohioans have done this",
    "before we have been here before we know",
    "what works",
    "wearing a mask works keeping a distance",
    "keeping some discipline washing your",
    "hands",
    "all of these things work and if we can",
    "do these again at a high level",
    "uh we'll we'll knock this virus right",
    "back",
    "uh but this virus is coming on",
    "really strong now and it's coming on",
    "strong all throughout",
    "the state of ohio and so what we did",
    "before",
    "we can do again this is really the third",
    "big challenge",
    "our first challenge was you know ohioans",
    "basically stay home you control this",
    "thing",
    "we did that ohioans did that did it",
    "phenomenally well",
    "the second one was was as you said three",
    "months ago",
    "and i gave the speech then we started",
    "putting",
    "you know mass quarters on and ohioans",
    "rose to the challenge again",
    "and started wearing the mask at a much",
    "higher compliance and because of that",
    "we knocked it down again",
    "now we've got a really high rate",
    "and it's moving fast and we can do it",
    "again",
    "we've been through this and one of the",
    "reasons i i like the ad",
    "that our two coaches did um uh",
    "her admirer jim tressel uh because",
    "that's the emphasis of hey we're tough",
    "we're ohioans we can do this",
    "we got to hang in there and that's",
    "really",
    "where this game is we can see the end",
    "and we don't know exactly what it's",
    "going to be but it's it's we",
    "certainly think it's going to be next",
    "year and we certainly think we're going",
    "to have the",
    "have the vaccine we're going to get the",
    "vaccine out to to",
    "enough people so at some point then",
    "the world gets back to where we want it",
    "to be",
    "but our goal should be to have all of us",
    "who are",
    "alive right now make it and be there and",
    "be there at the end",
    "and we can do that and we can do it",
    "without",
    "destroying what we love in fact the",
    "virus is the biggest threat to our",
    "schools the virus is the biggest threat",
    "to our loved ones in nursing homes the",
    "virus is the biggest threat to our",
    "economy",
    "and when we recognize that",
    "when we put on a mask and do do what we",
    "have to do",
    "this is our pathway to freedom it's our",
    "pathway to keep the economy going it's",
    "our pathway to keep our kids in school",
    "it's a pathway to keep our kids in",
    "college it's a pathway to",
    "do the things that we want to do and if",
    "the virus",
    "continues to roar through ohio you know",
    "we're not going to be able to do those",
    "things so i i think it's",
    "this is the third big challenge we've",
    "faced it's here",
    "it's i've tried to describe it today and",
    "describe it in the last several",
    "sessions the data clearly shows it but",
    "we can overcome it",
    "we can clearly overcome it because we've",
    "overcome it before",
    "next question is from jesse ballmer at",
    "the cincinnati enquirer",
    "hello governor um my question is there's",
    "a group of",
    "lawmakers in the senate introducing",
    "legislation to lift",
    "that 10 pm last call or early bar",
    "closures",
    "could you maybe respond to that or and",
    "give an update on",
    "your review of that issue yeah",
    "look um we'll talk about that next week",
    "um fully understand",
    "um i mean no one fully understands",
    "unless they're in the business but",
    "i i've talked to enough bar owners",
    "people who own restaurants",
    "to understand that this has had an",
    "adverse impact on them and we're looking",
    "for ways frankly to help them",
    "financially and we hope to be able to",
    "talk about something next week now we're",
    "never going to be able to put them make",
    "them whole",
    "we're never going to be able to make up",
    "that money but we need to help",
    "and i intend to help them and i want to",
    "talk with the legislature",
    "about the best way to to help them",
    "because",
    "they are in a unique position we've had",
    "a lot of small businesses that have been",
    "hurt but they've they've been hurt very",
    "specifically",
    "uh because of our need for the public",
    "good",
    "to close the bars at 10 o'clock",
    "um i've spent the last several days",
    "talking to a lot of people who would be",
    "directly impacted by that",
    "and this is going to be something that",
    "you know i just",
    "don't think that we're going to be able",
    "to do at this point",
    "we get this virus down uh we certainly",
    "will be able to",
    "to do that uh but we got to get it down",
    "and we got to get control of it um but",
    "we're working",
    "i've been working with the lieutenant",
    "governor and i uh",
    "and we want to take something to the",
    "legislature in the next several days",
    "and work with them to come up with some",
    "financial help for those",
    "those those bars and those restaurants",
    "so",
    "uh you know this these numbers um",
    "you know candidly i thought we would be",
    "able to lift that this",
    "but when you look at these numbers these",
    "numbers are just",
    "horrible and they're going the wrong way",
    "and we",
    "just can't do it at this point",
    "next question is from max philby at the",
    "columbus dispatch",
    "hey governor the state of ohio doesn't",
    "require",
    "health care providers to report specific",
    "vaccinations",
    "to the state and i'm wondering if you",
    "think that's something the legislature",
    "should consider",
    "changing in preparation for a coveted",
    "vaccine and",
    "why or why not you know i'm not really",
    "looked at that",
    "um and i'll get back to you on that but",
    "i i you know one of the things that",
    "you know we want to be able to know uh",
    "is all kinds of data like that",
    "and so you gotta protect people's he",
    "protect people's privacy",
    "uh but knowing numbers uh",
    "you know what percentage of people that",
    "uh you know have received a vaccination",
    "uh is certainly very important it's it's",
    "a question that you know i know i",
    "ask our team in regard to flu uh",
    "well baby shots uh these are all things",
    "that you know",
    "the legislature needs to know and the",
    "governor needs to know and the people of",
    "ohio need to know because they affect",
    "the health of all of us",
    "so i'll get back to you on that but",
    "certainly",
    "more information is better",
    "next question is from john london at",
    "wlwt in cincinnati",
    "hi governor i've tried to listen to you",
    "really carefully here today i've heard",
    "you",
    "say this is the worst situation ohio has",
    "been in",
    "you said red tide flowing across the",
    "state no county has gone purple",
    "governor and despite the dramatic higher",
    "numbers and the positivity no",
    "changes have been made in the rules or",
    "the guidelines and i'm wondering what",
    "you're prepared to do if the numbers",
    "keep going up",
    "what would be at risk and what's your",
    "trigger point are we",
    "close to that now",
    "you know john um",
    "there's a limit to what a governor could",
    "do or should do",
    "um and we're at the point",
    "where we have to live with this virus",
    "the consequences of going in and",
    "shutting things down again",
    "would be devastating not just",
    "financially but devastating to people",
    "in their individual lives so we do not",
    "want to be in a position to do that",
    "but let me make it really clear this is",
    "not a situation",
    "where we don't know what to do this is",
    "not a situation where we don't know what",
    "works",
    "thank heavens we know what works and",
    "we've learned it",
    "the hard way we've learned it an",
    "agonizing seven and a half months",
    "but there is now a real real consensus",
    "among health experts the medical",
    "community the world over",
    "about the things that we can do that",
    "can keep this virus down and they lie",
    "within each and every",
    "one of ohio citizens each and every one",
    "of us",
    "has the power to change the future",
    "when you look at the data today the",
    "future that that paints is",
    "ugly it is not good",
    "um it will be",
    "a tough very tough tough",
    "november december january maybe february",
    "who knows how long",
    "we can avoid most of this pain",
    "we can avoid",
    "losing a lot more people than we should",
    "be losing",
    "but we've got to do the basic things",
    "we've got to wear mask in public",
    "we've got to keep a distance we've got",
    "to not go to",
    "events that look look like fun",
    "but where you're going to have family or",
    "friends there",
    "at least that are big gatherings and if",
    "you can keep gatherings outside",
    "i know it's getting colder but if you",
    "keep some things outside",
    "but at the very you know we're a mask",
    "this mask if both people are wearing",
    "masks",
    "the data the more data i see the better",
    "the better this this looks um",
    "and so we all have within ourselves",
    "the power uh to live with this",
    "which is really what we have to do so",
    "i'm",
    "you know i hope that the data we showed",
    "today",
    "um will kind of be a wake-up call",
    "uh to every ohioan uh that this is real",
    "it's real in your county um",
    "and but we have it within our capacity",

    "two political events now within the last",
    "month the one in cleveland with the",
    "debate and then the pence event on",
    "monday",
    "uh in both circumstances there was",
    "inconsistencies in the",
    "and the people that were social",
    "distancing and also wearing masks",
    "um i'm just curious because we've talked",
    "about accountability here",
    "um how can you stress accountability for",
    "ohioans",
    "in everyday life but not to the trump",
    "campaign at different events",
    "well i can reassure you that i've",
    "done my level best to practice what we",
    "preach i've worn",
    "masks tried to keep my distance from",
    "folks",
    "i know it's a complicated matter right",
    "now with political campaigns going on",
    "but you know i can't you know look the",
    "the political events",
    "are allowed to occur under the order",
    "uh we have tried to set a good example",
    "i stood up in front of a hostile crowd",
    "and asked them to wear masks",
    "much to my own peril as they didn't",
    "think much of my suggestion",
    "but i i you know that's the",
    "the best the best thing that we can do",
    "is to try to",
    "act as good examples i've tried to do",
    "that and",
    "and believe that is consistent with what",
    "we've been saying",
    "next question is from jake zuckerman at",
    "the ohio capitol journal",
    "hi governor case loads hospital rolls",
    "death counts positivity",
    "i mean all the indicators are moving in",
    "the wrong direction",
    "is there any kind of policy or strategic",
    "change underway or are we just kind of",
    "betting it all",
    "that people change their habits this",
    "latent game",
    "well look there's there's well",
    "dolly is dally is commenting on like",
    "what i'm doing i guess anyway hello",
    "dolly um",
    "there's three things really going on i",
    "think",
    "one is is certainly beyond",
    "our control and that is what",
    "the companies are doing uh in regard to",
    "coming up with the vaccine",
    "uh that's coming two",
    "is what people do it's the most",
    "important thing",
    "because the most barring",
    "having the medical solution uh",
    "the shot you know it comes back to what",
    "we all do",
    "we know what works we know mass work",
    "uh and literally if 80 percent of the",
    "people of this state",
    "would wear masks and be careful we'd",
    "knock these numbers",
    "down dramatically",
    "the other thing is you know incumbent",
    "upon us",
    "and local health departments and mayors",
    "and everyone else but",
    "but i take the lead and that is to get",
    "testing",
    "out and get testing and make it",
    "available",
    "throughout the state and have it done in",
    "a strategic",
    "way that accomplishes two things uh",
    "one is those tests have to be deployed",
    "and are being deployed to save lives",
    "directly",
    "so the most vulnerable population are",
    "nursing homes for example",
    "and the other you know is to you know",
    "slow community spread",
    "make sure that we're hitting uh",
    "underserved populations",
    "national guard is is helping us do that",
    "but a lot is going on in regard to",
    "testing right now",
    "as we deploy new tests and we continue",
    "to look at other ways to get more",
    "testing",
    "so that's on us things are going okay",
    "we just need to keep kicking it up and",
    "kicking it up",
    "next question is from jack windsor at",
    "wmfd in mansfield",
    "hey jack hi governor you reviewed the",
    "advisory system and pointed out",
    "there are a few indicators that are",
    "flagged in many of the rick counties",
    "of those two can be triggered by",
    "non-coveted illnesses",
    "outpatient visits and emergency",
    "department visits",
    "and three of them are tied to tasks now",
    "those new tests you mentioned we're",
    "getting",
    "and using the fda guidance says they",
    "pick up bacterial infection",
    "viral fragments that are old and not",
    "contagious and even non-covate viruses",
    "and the fda warns that a positive test",
    "needs to be considered other factors",
    "five of the seven indicators governor on",
    "the system are wobbling so how do we",
    "know",
    "we're not getting right indicators and",
    "high incidence warnings based on",
    "non-coveted illnesses and positive tests",
    "that are either false",
    "or lack additional uh consideration",
    "you have system is perfect um and this",
    "is not perfect",
    "uh you know but this was put together",
    "uh with advice from national experts",
    "from people in the trump administration",
    "um",
    "to come up with a way to measure",
    "um using a number of different",
    "indicators so you weren't just relying",
    "on one",
    "to tell the people in the community",
    "exactly where they are",
    "we think this system works works very",
    "well",
    "um you know we also tell people to look",
    "at the number of cases",
    "in that community that's very very",
    "important as you heard one of the",
    "doctors talk about from their",
    "perspective",
    "uh very understandably it's the number",
    "of",
    "people going into the hospital",
    "and so you know by all indications we're",
    "headed the wrong direction if you look",
    "at just the people going into the",
    "hospital",
    "which is a lagging indicator",
    "death would be the last lagging",
    "indicator farthest lagging but",
    "going into hospitals pretty far along i",
    "mean you've already",
    "you've been exposed and then you've you",
    "know you've come up with symptoms",
    "usually and then you're tested",
    "and then maybe you get really sick and",
    "anyway you end up in the hospital",
    "so the the number of of covet patients",
    "in the hospital today",
    "is about double what it was not too long",
    "ago so",
    "we're not no one's saying we're",
    "overflowing with patients",
    "but that's a that's an indicator that",
    "you know is a solid solid solid",
    "indicator we think the other ones are",
    "solid too but you just count the number",
    "of people in the hospital",
    "from from from covet",
    "we use the other indicators frankly",
    "because that's a lagging indicator",
    "we need to we need to see what's early",
    "on going on so at least we can",
    "give give the community some indication",
    "of which way",
    "which way they're going and so every",
    "indicator",
    "is going the wrong way on us",
    "right now next question is from laura",
    "hancock",
    "at cleveland.com hello governor",
    "hey laura hi um poll workers have been",
    "told",
    "this was like in august that they um",
    "cannot ask people to wear masks",
    "at polling places it was directed from",
    "secretary frank larose",
    "um now there's a surge and people are",
    "early voting",
    "um if there's a statewide mass mandate",
    "why can't",
    "we make people wear masks at polls",
    "yeah i think my understanding i've",
    "talked to the secretary of state uh",
    "franklin rose about this",
    "is that you know people are told to wear",
    "a mask",
    "when the when they're voting they're",
    "told to wear a mask in line if they're",
    "waiting in line",
    "all the people working there wearing",
    "masks but i think",
    "when asked the question would you deny",
    "someone the right to vote",
    "who would not wear a mask his answer was",
    "no we would not",
    "deny them the right to vote and i think",
    "you know we get into some other",
    "very serious constitutional issues",
    "when we if we would say we're going to",
    "deny you the right to vote",
    "if you did not have a mask so i think",
    "that",
    "you know everyone's told to wear a mask",
    "everyone's expected to wear a mask will",
    "there be someone",
    "you know or some people who show up and",
    "don't worry i suppose",
    "uh but that's that's not what",
    "we're telling people to do but if you",
    "get down to the question are you gonna",
    "throw that person out you're gonna tell",
    "them you cannot vote",
    "it's election day whatever day it is",
    "you're not going to vote",
    "we're not going to allow you to vote",
    "without a mask what the secretary of",
    "state has said and",
    "i don't disagree is we're not going to",
    "deny that person the right to vote",
    "but we're asking them please wear a mask",
    "governor look we've got if i could just",
    "we've got we've got poll workers are",
    "going to be there 15 hours",
    "uh or so and 13 of those hours the polls",
    "are open",
    "they're going to be exposed to a lot of",
    "lot of people",
    "and so you know it's just not right to",
    "walk in there",
    "and not have a mask on john yeah",
    "that's exactly right you know we need to",
    "respect each other",
    "uh protect each other and i think the",
    "process will work is if you come",
    "in you will be offered a mask if you",
    "don't have one",
    "uh if at that point uh you don't want to",
    "wear a mask then i think they will",
    "encourage you to vote curbside because",
    "there is a curbside option",
    "for voting so that you don't have to be",
    "in the facility without a mask",
    "uh and at that point after the poll",
    "workers exhaust",
    "all of their options uh for trying to",
    "get somebody to cast a vote in a",
    "in a safer manner then they would",
    "just allow the person to vote because",
    "you can't deny them",
    "that opportunity and and that's the",
    "procedure that will be followed",
    "next question is from dan perlman at",
    "wcmh",
    "in columbus hi governor",
    "earlier today you said that there are",
    "several red counties that",
    "have formal events planned such as club",
    "crawls political events art affairs",
    "and now is the time to rethink whether",
    "those should go",
    "on focusing on political events would",
    "you",
    "urge political candidates from both",
    "parties to refrain from holding these",
    "events",
    "here in ohio and would you attend a",
    "rally or event",
    "given the situation that we are in right",
    "now",
    "well our message is consistent",
    "uh what we've said whether we're talking",
    "about political rally a demonstration",
    "uh you know anything like that",
    "as far as exercising first amendment",
    "rights",
    "and that is please everyone more mask",
    "we've asked organizers to you know make",
    "sure",
    "people have the opportunity to wear a",
    "mask they're encouraged to wear a mask",
    "and",
    "should wear a mask um and so i would",
    "hope",
    "that um you know i wouldn't say that we",
    "shouldn't joe biden shouldn't come into",
    "ohio or the president shouldn't come or",
    "the vice presidential candidate",
    "shouldn't come i would never say that",
    "uh what i should would say though and i",
    "am saying is that",
    "look we need to be careful uh and we",
    "need to keep",
    "have events where people can keep a",
    "distance we need to try to do them",
    "outside",
    "and we need to you know have a strict",
    "adherence to wearing a mask",
    "i mean that's what we have told every",
    "every group",
    "um and sometimes you know people listen",
    "more than they they do",
    "other times but um you know that's the",
    "message it's pretty simple",
    "uh you can have these rallies you can",
    "have uh you know the opportunity to",
    "to do these things which is part of um",
    "you know the month of october",
    "and early early early november as these",
    "campaigns",
    "wind down uh you know this is what we",
    "expect to see particularly if we live in",
    "ohio because ohio's always a",
    "battleground state so i'm not saying",
    "this shouldn't occur",
    "but there's ways of doing it and we just",
    "encourage everybody to do it in a safe",
    "a safe way next question is from alex",
    "ebert at bloomberg",
    "hey governor sorry for the delay there",
    "um",
    "we've heard some trepidation it seems",
    "between the medical experts that we've",
    "had on today and yourself",
    "saying that we're not at the point where",
    "we should be concerned about",
    "hospitals being overflowing but it also",
    "seems like we're not ruling that out in",
    "the future",
    "what are the medical experts telling you",
    "about the chances for that happening in",
    "the future",
    "if these statistics don't go in a better",
    "direction for ohio thank you",
    "well i don't know that i've asked that",
    "specific question",
    "but there's grave concern with these",
    "with these numbers several doctors were",
    "quoting the paper",
    "you can see by the quotes that they have",
    "very significant",
    "significant concerns",
    "we prepared well in the spring",
    "for a surge that because of what ohioans",
    "did we",
    "didn't get thank heavens unlike other",
    "states",
    "but these numbers are terrible i mean",
    "this is alarming",
    "and they've come up very quickly",
    "very quickly and it's not just one",
    "alarm going off this is every alarm",
    "going off right now",
    "so we have the ability to turn this",
    "thing around",
    "and it's pretty simple what we need to",
    "do we need to wear a mask",
    "we need to be careful uh we need to",
    "protect each other",
    "and we can we can do that but",
    "you know we we had a build out of",
    "hospitals",
    "that we didn't need uh everybody's still",
    "got their plan",
    "everybody's still ready to go if they",
    "have to go",
    "but uh you know we certainly hope we",
    "don't we don't need that but i know",
    "there's grave concern with doctors",
    "there's a very serious concern",
    "uh with people in the medical community",
    "i i have",
    "talked about and look there's a lot of",
    "ways of measuring this",
    "um you know the worst case scenario",
    "uh is that we overflow our hospitals and",
    "people can't get other care",
