hello and welcome to haunted tales of
the ohio state house
my name is katie and i work at this
historic building
the ohio state house is over 150 years
old
with its construction starting in 1839.
originally by penitentiary workers
being 150 plus years old the state house
has seen
many important things rights given to
ohioans
important political historic speeches as
well
as on occasion a funeral
as historians we believe that objects
help to tell a story but what if
these objects do more than just help to
tell the story
what if they hold on to the energy of
the people and events
that happened in the past and what if
they help to keep the stories
alive in more ways than we know
what if this place and these objects
serve as a conduit
for the energy of events and people gone
before
and what if those people are still here
in some way
trying to tell their own story
i myself have had multiple strange
occurrences in this building that i
cannot explain
perhaps if you join us on a journey
through this building
you may be able to see these stories
come alive

the ohio penitentiary even though it has
since been torn down
still has a creepy hold on the ohio
state house
in more than one unsettling way
as one of the oldest buildings in
columbus the walls of the ohio state
house
have heard it all throughout its long
history
a whole host of characters have convened
here it is of course
the people's house it's no surprise then
that along with the impressive beats
that have been accomplished here
there have also been some shocking and
hair-raising tales that accompany those
who used to wander these halls one
gruesome rumor was perpetuated by former
governor
joseph euphoraker in september 1886
governor forker spoke at the
metropolitan opera house in columbus
while campaigning for republican
politicians who are running in the
upcoming
november election in an attempt
to distinguish his party from the
competition governor forker
leveled a bold claim his predecessor
democratic governor
george hoadley had appointed some shady
characters to oversee the state's
penitentiary
by the time governor forker had
appointed a new prison warden
the complex had fallen into a state of
disrepair
but that wasn't the worst of it forever
claimed that one inmate
frederick w nye contacted him with a
signed affidavit
proclaiming that he had been ordered to
assist two doctors
in the prison hospital in making canes
out of dead prisoner's
skin nai's services were required in
stripping skin from the backs of
deceased prisoners
drying out the skin and preparing it for
use on the canes
in his sworn statement nye contended
that he had made
five canes two for each of the doctors
and nye kept one for himself which he
later passed on to the governor as
proof of the scandal forecaster's speech
was published in newspapers
all across the state of ohio democrats
of course declared the ghastly
allegations to be false
and the doctors said to be involved in
the scandal staunchly denied the claims
but the rumors persisted according to a
doctor
entrusted by forker to analyze nia's
cane
the cane was produced using three types
of skin
two from different people and one from
an
animal nye's story was also corroborated
by other inmates and prison workers who
noted the foul stench
coming from his workshop so
was there any truth to these claims or
was it simply a way to drum up
controversy before an election
certainly it was not uncommon for prison
workers to collect
little trophies from deceased inmates
stories about pieces of skin and hair
were widely circulated
we might never know if prison officials
sanctioned
the making of human skin canes but the
story stayed
front and center for many months and the
governor
who made such bold and sinister claims
earned a new nickname skin came
forager
addicts have long been thought of as a
hiding place
for spirits and ghosts join our historic
site manager chris
on a journey up to the cupola to see
what lurks
there

the yorkshire museum in the united
kingdom issued a challenge a couple of
years ago
you see they had a curious object in
their museum collections
the object was a third to fourth century
roman woman's hair bun made of real hair
complete with the pin still sticking
through it
the challenge which was issued to other
museums was
can you beat it that is do you have an
object that is creepier
different museums responded
enthusiastically
one museum reported a petrified sheep's
heart
punctured by nails another museum
reported
a blood-soaked doll with a missing eye
yet another museum reported a
particularly gruesome
smiling executioner's mask
and finally another museum reported a
decapitated cat
curiously posed plucking a harp
now that is curious and i thought we
have a cat-related object in our state
house collections
and as i began to read more and more
about curious museum collections
i found that many of them had deceased
cats in their inventory
and most of these cats were found within
the walls of buildings
in the museum community they're called
concealed cats
evidence suggests that the custom of cat
concealment began in the 13th century
and continued into the modern era
originating in europe
the practice was brought to north
america by immigrants
but why scholars on the subject offer up
three possible reasons one a foundation
sacrifice two an attempt to scare off
vermin
or three accidental entrapment
now let's take a look at our concealed
cat
this turn-of-the-century shoebox was
found during the renovation of the ohio
state house in the 1990s
the label on the box reads the excelsior
shoe company
fine shoes portsmouth ohio
and pencil riding on the label seems to
indicate that the shoes inside
were an eight and a half only there were
no shoes inside
when this box was pulled from within the
walls of the state house instead
what is contained inside are the
disarticulated
skeletal remains of a cat
[Music]
we must ask ourselves why was this
deceased cat
placed in this shoe box and left at the
ohio state house
if we consult the previously mentioned
list
this is definitely an intentional
placement so
accidental entrapment doesn't count
an attempt to scare off vermin well
as you can see
this hole in the side of the box was
most likely made by
vermin probably a mouse or a rat and
it helped itself to what was left of the
cat
certainly it didn't leave as much to
take a look at
so that only leaves foundation sacrifice
but this cat was not found in the
foundation of the ohio state house in
fact this
curiously concealed cat was found about
as far away from the foundation as you
get
without leaving the building to find
where this concealed cat was placed
we have to go up
[Music]
since 1861 when the ohio state house was
first complete
visitors have climbed these stairs to
get to the observation deck of the
cupola
once arriving at the observation deck
visitors are greeted with a beautiful
view of the city of columbus spreading
out before them
and reaching into the countryside
this is the observation deck of the
cupola
and as i mentioned earlier the shoebox
and remains of the cat were found during
the renovation of the ohio state house
they were actually found on the inside
of this wall
while they were doing ventilation work
but to
really get an idea of what it looks like
within the walls
we need to go up to what we like to call
the tippy top
above us is the skylight of the drum and
below
is the interior of the dome and if you
look down you can see between the walls
and the structure and perhaps
a former worker at the ohio state house
left behind this cat
over a century ago or perhaps a visitor
snuck up the stairs
leaving behind a beloved companion
placing them
between the capitol walls as an honored
resting place for all eternity
for whatever the reason that this
curiously concealed cat from the cupola
was placed here
it still resides within the walls of the
ohio state house
in our museum collections thank you for
joining us
and happy halloween
the ohio state house took 22 years
to build and as such it only makes sense
that each stone would have a story
to tell
the ohio state house completed in 1861
is one of the oldest buildings here in
the city of columbus
with such a long and storied history if
these stones and bricks could talk
they would have many interesting tales
to tell
some stones in particular would have
especially chilling stories
for example these stones that i am
standing on
these particular stones came from the
floor of the columbus
state hospital originally known as the
ohio hospital for the insane
the first institution of its kind the
lunatic asylum of ohio
was completed in 1838 it was located
about a mile from the ohio state house
on east broad street and was designed by
nathan b
kelly who later became the architect of
the capitol
and who was instrumental in designing
the building that we're in today
prison labor was also crucial to the
building of the ohio state house
many of the bricks and the stones that
are around me were worked on
by prisoners of the state of ohio and
many of those same prisoners had
also worked on the lunatic asylum the
two structures share a strong connection
literally the same hands built both
however
unlike the ohio state house the asylum
no longer stands
it was burned down in 1868 on november
18th
in a deadly blaze that killed six
patients
instead of rebuilding on that same east
broad street site
then governor rutherford b hayes
convinced the state to sell that plot
and buy a new one on the west end of
columbus
that plot was purchased from william
sullivan who had originally owned
capitol square
where the state house is located today
the foundation for the new hospital was
laid on july 4th
1870 and the building was completed
exactly seven years later
the columbus hospital for the insane as
the new building was
originally called was built according to
the kirkbride plan
which emphasized large open spaces and
fresh air
originally designed to house 850
patients
by 1935 it held almost three thousand
with almost three times the number of
patients that it was designed for
it would have been impossible for the
spaces to be used as they had been
intended
overcrowding was likely a serious issue
underfunding was likely an issue as well
according to a report from 1895
that year the number of patients had
increased by 25 percent
but funding had remained stagnant death
was a common occurrence
at the columbus state hospital many
patients spent
decades confined to the campus only to
eventually succumb to their mental
illnesses
many others died of communicable
diseases that were common
especially in the early years of the
hospital's history
the spread of disease would have been
exacerbated by the aforementioned
overcrowding issue one medical writer in
the 1890s estimated that 95
of the deaths were due to preventable
illnesses
it must have felt like a nightmare to
watch disease ravage the halls
all while being trapped by walls both
physical and mental
as dr kirkbride himself noted even the
asylums that provided the best
possible care for the time which for
decades included things such as
lobotomies and
harsh electroshock therapy isolation
would have been an
ever-present issue as he said it is
among the most painful features of
insanity
that in its treatment so many are
compelled to leave their families
feelings of isolation depression
confusion
would have been ever-present in the
asylum
by the early 1980s the columbus state
hospital was in such a severe state of
disrepair
that the cost to restore it was
virtually insurmountable
so too had public asylums and hospitals
for the insane
fallen out of favor thus by 1985
the columbus state hospital was closed
and by 1996
it had been completely demolished
however
this floor was saved and brought here to
the ohio state house during the capital
restoration
of the 1990s did spirits
of the more than a century's worth of
patients from the columbus state
hospital
follow along is it merely coincidence
that staff have heard voices and even
their names whisper to them
in this very space i'll leave that to
you to decide
we hope you enjoyed your journey through
the ohio state house
and learned a little of the spooky
history that lurks
within
