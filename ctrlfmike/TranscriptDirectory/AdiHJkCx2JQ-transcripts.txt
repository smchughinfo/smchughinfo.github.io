[Music]
so
[Music]
hear ye hear ye hear ye the honorable
chief justice and justices of the
supreme court of ohio
the honorable supreme court of ohio is
now an open session
pursuant to adjournment good morning
ladies and gentlemen
our first case this morning is 2019-15
uh robert wilson at all versus abukar
atik durrani
md at all you'll notice that in place
of justice fisher we have judge
judge scott quinn from the 5th district
court of appeals and in place of justice
dewine
we have judge bill clatt from the 10th
district court of appeals
both justices have recused themselves
and these appellate judges
are sitting by appointment uh thank you
gentlemen welcome
for the appellant uh i'm going to ask mr
herzog or herzeg please
uh to begin madam chief justice and
justices of the court good morning i am
aaron kerzig on behalf of appellants
i'd like to reserve three minutes for
rebuttal may it please the court
when the general assembly wrote the
medical claim statute of repose
revised code section 2305.113
c it included specific exceptions that
could extend
the very strict four-year limit on
bringing bringing a medical malpractice
claim
in ohio the reversal savings statute
revised code 2305.19
was not among those exceptions the court
below nevertheless found
that it could extend the statute of
prose
the decision below is contrary to the
plain language of the statute of repose
the nature and purpose of statutes of
repose the tools of statutory
construction that this court uses
the structure of ohio's general scheme
for limitations on civil actions
and the logic of this court's decision
in antoon
and i think council what's the purpose
of the statute of repose why was it
enacted
there are several purposes your honor
one
is to ensure that medical providers
have notice of claims another is to
ensure that those claims
don't get stale and most importantly i
think it is to
end the uh
finally firmly and finally end claims uh
so that they can be free from liability
as the language this and other courts
have used
so for those three reasons how does the
savings statute
go contrary to those reasons uh
well i think most importantly uh your
honor the savings statute
would allow medical claims against
medical providers
to continue essentially uh for many many
years
uh beyond what the general assembly has
how many many years
if you only get one refiling
it's it well it's it's it's unknown your
honor as you know in ohio
uh you can voluntarily dismiss under 41a
on the eve of trial
uh refile and so a case might have been
going on for
seven or eight years uh a a plaintiff
could
dismiss and refile and then start the
clock completely over because
as this court has said very clearly in
antune and many other cases
a dismissal under 41a terminates the
original case as if it never
happened and a new case commences at
that point
but the defendants are on there on
notice that there's a claim
i mean all the reasons for the statute
of repose here
are are not there's no derogation of
those
when applying the the saving statute
that applies to
to all cases i i don't see how this
should
be any different uh two two points i
think justice stewart one
is uh that is not uh it does not serve
all of the purposes
of a statute of propose one of the
purposes is to firmly and finally end
liability in the specter of liability
for
medical providers and the statute of
repose
as written by the general assembly uh
intends for that period to end
uh four years after the act or
occurrence
so that certainly is not met by the
saving statute now that this
closes is commencing with within four
years
commencement yes your honor and this
court has been very clear since at least
the devil case in 1959
that uh when a when a case is dismissed
under rule 41a
it is if it is is as if it never existed
and so you look at the new case and when
it commenced
uh we think the logic of antoon uh
really drives the decision
here your honor and while this court
left open the question
uh it did not uh suggest that the courts
of appeals should write on a blank slate
in fact there are important lessons to
be drawn
from antoon well from a legal standpoint
yes this is this
is it's as if it never existed but the
defendants are put on notice
of the of the claim which is one of the
things the statute of proposal is
supposed to protect
because i would imagine if there's
litigation on a case and then it is
dismissed
as if it never happened i can't imagine
a defendant would could go to the lawyer
and say
well i don't owe you anything because
the litigation never happened
your honor i i i'm not going to dispute
the fact that
what that that in this situation that
particular
purpose of the statute of uh of repose
is not really an issue these cases were
refiled fairly closely in time
afterwards so there was notice
of course as you pointed out the the
question really is one of law not policy
and so uh we think the statute of repose
is very clear
on its plain language uh and that uh as
i was saying the decision in entune
says very clearly that uh when looking
at the statute of proposed for medical
claims
uh the court should look to the newly
filed complaint the complaint in this
case filed in hamilton county in 2015
and decide whether that complaint was
filed within four years of the actor or
occurrence
there's no dispute here that it did not
and so
we think the statute of repose applies
fundamentally the one thing i think this
court and the general assembly have been
clear about
in antoon going back to ruther in other
cases
is that statutes of repose are different
from statutes of limitations
where statutes of limitations can have
equitable
polling or the exceptions generally in
the statutes
apply statutes of repose are to be read
strictly
that's not just what this court says
it's what the ohio the u.s supreme court
has said over and over again
including cts corp versus wahlberger and
the calpers cases that we cite
in our briefs so uh while
the underlying policy considerations uh
may be useful
uh i think this court has to start with
the plain language
and read the statute of repose as the
general assembly
intended it this is part of
a long-running
work by the general assembly in this
court to understand
the limits of medical malpractice claims
the general assembly has put very strict
limits on those claims it treats them
very differently uh a plaintiff has to
get an affidavit of merit which is not
something we require
of other torts the statute of
limitations is only a year and there is
a statute of repose we think the general
assembly
has signaled very clearly that
medical malpractice claims
should be strictly uh limited
and this court the council the savings
statute then has no relevance here
if you say that the um
uh that the um
statute of repose is the
consideration the guide guidance here uh
the savings has no even though they
filed within the one year
is that what you're saying uh yes chief
justice the
the the saving statute applies to
statute of limitations
and and it in fact applies to statutes
of limitations and medical claims
uh this court has said so since saunders
in 1984 and we don't dispute that
it applies to statutes of limitations
generally we think the rule
is and should be reinforced here
that there are no exceptions to extend
statutes of repose
other than those explicitly written into
the statutes by the general assembly we
think that's what
this court's uh the logic of this
court's in tune decision
dictates we think that's what ruther
dictates uh and
uh and so yes the the statute the saving
statutes applies
to the statute of limitations unless the
general assembly expressly says
otherwise
uh and if you see uh at page 24 of our
brief we have a chart that shows
that the general assembly has from time
to time done that
it references 2305.1
in the product liability saving in the
product liability statute of repose
and so uh there we think the general
assembly was saying yes
use the stat the savings statute
the key here too of course your honors
is that the general assembly
has specific exceptions that it did
write into
the statute of repose the council
but couldn't do the legislature have
said this saving statute
does not apply to the statute or oppose
um yes it could your honor but i don't
think it ever thought that it needed to
based on
the long history of jurisprudence of
this court and the state of ohio the
ever changing legislature
you don't think that they i mean because
time and time again we have seen
or that or where that isn't necessarily
the case
so if we wanted to be clear that it
didn't apply
it seems like they would specifically
have noted that
that they yes that could have been
another way they did it i think
they did it very very clearly here
though by
incorporating certain exceptions and not
incorporating others
i think of it frankly as there being a
menu of
ways to extend statutes of limitations
in
ohio law the savings statute is one of
them
unsound mind disability or minority is
another
uh and the general assembly chose from
that menu picked particular things to
put into 2305.113 c
crafted a very detailed uh and specific
uh exceptions to that in section d of
this statute
and so i think you have to read that to
say that what they didn't incorporate
they did not intend to apply plaintiff
i'm sorry council
planets use the savings statute for a
variety of reasons
and it could amount to
on the eve of trial having one of their
experts pass away or some type of
emergency like that
and they might refile the case right
after a month
but after the the statute of repose do
you think the legislature intended cases
uh in which that occurs to be not
decided on the merits simply because
the refiling fell after the
uh expiration of the statute or opposed
something that had been lit being
litigated
fully beforehand i i do your honor and i
think
i think that this court has uh made
clear that that is
uh permissible i think um when you look
at
there are lots of uh consequences to
rule 41a dismissals i think uh justice
mcgee brown and her
concurrence in ruther made clear at
paragraph 38 of that decision
that any deadline may have a harsh
result for the person who misses that
deadline
but those are the choices the general
assembly is allowed to make in deciding
what the deadline isn't missed here
that's that's the point it's
it's not miss and an example that
justice donnelly gave
there is nothing missed the litigation
has gone
on missing the deadline is is one thing
and and the statute talks about
commencement clearly the
the action has been commenced
uh justice stewart i think antoon makes
clear though that
once voluntarily dismissed this court
and the general assembly treat that
action as it was
as if it was never commenced so i think
you really do have to look at the
second the new filing of the new action
and um and how is that how is your
interpretation just
how how is it just from from a policy
standpoint
from a statutory interpretation
standpoint from a
from a case law standpoint of of cases
should be decided on their merits
i i i i think justice stewart that the
general assembly uh as this court said
in
antoon uh and uh is is balancing
it is essentially the one that
determines that balance of fairness
and justice uh in this setting
to go back to what justice mcgee brown
said
she said the results may seem harsh but
it is the general assembly's decision
to determine uh where to draw those
lines
uh this court if i had filed my
memorandum in support of jurisdiction at
501 on the day that it was due
would have told me that i couldn't uh
continue my appeal
it is a harsh result but uh it is one
uh that uh this court enforces strictly
uh even if that might be unjust for my
client and certainly if this court can
enforce rules in that strict of a manner
the general assembly can decide
to enforce strict rules as well
and they're also this is where this
court takes not on civil matters
obviously but
also grants delayed appeals that are not
timely
uh it it does from from time to time
your honor and the general assembly
uh if it was making the deadlines for
this court could make those choices as
well
but i do think those are the choices for
the general assembly to make we think
they've clearly made them here
uh madam chief justice i've i'm over my
time i'd like to reserve what i have
left
okay thank you mr flowers
uh good morning uh chief justice
o'connor uh members of the court
my name is uh paul flowers i represent
the plaintiff peles in this case
robert williams and michael and amber
sands
um i have a number of co-counsel on the
case with me who i'm not going to
introduce but i know they're actively
watching because of all the text
messages i'm receiving
and with that i will say i would like to
start off with with
judge justice stewart's initial question
uh which i really thought got right to
the heart of it that dealt with
the policy considerations um let me just
say first i
thought one of the the criticisms of the
first district's opinion that is unfair
is that they were engaging in
public policy which is not true
they were following legislative policy
there's a big difference
we know what the legislative policy is
for the statute of proposal in this case
because
this court identified it in both and
tuned
and in ruther and what we're really
looking for here is to
one make sure there's no indefinite
litigation a definite filing on
litigation and two to provide certainty
and predictability
um for the for the defendants
in the first district just looks at this
and says you know what
this doesn't violate any of that um
they're using it as a cross check
they're just applying the plain and
ordinary meaning of these two statutes
uh which can be applied together
and the first district's opinion look it
looks at that and says
uh by doing this we are not overwriting
these policies
uh the defendants get notice within the
four years of the lawsuit they can
preserve witnesses they can gather
evidence they can prepare their defenses
um they have the notice that's what the
statute proposes intended to accomplish
instead of looking at policy
considerations i'm most concerned
with the actual language of the statute
so how do you
how do you address the language that we
have in the statute of propose
that i'm paraphrasing but says this is
it
this is all you have it's it's four
years how
how do you address that i agree with you
100
you have four years to file your claim
it's it's the other side of the window
so statute limitations is one side of
the window statute or opposed the other
side of the window
you have to file it uh within the four
years and that was accomplished here
i mean um it was done and the statute of
proposals satisfied
statute opposed at that point can be set
aside now we have the statute of
we have the savings statute that comes
in only because
the action had to be dismissed to get a
venue that was going to
lead to a faster trial um in hamilton
county
the council council according to my
calculations and
maybe my math is off but uh didn't uh
the um wilson's uh
four and a half years uh post surgery
and sans
five years post surgery in the uh
filing for the for the refiling in
hamilton county
yes yes that's about right the refiling
in hamilton county was five days after
the dismissal
that's december 16 2015 and then we had
about two weeks
um for the sands uh they refiled in
december 9 2015
you know scarcely any gap in time at all
well you know scarcely you know it i
mean that's
not what the statue said as as justice
french uh
the statute of repose bars a suit that
is brought after a specified time
uh and it as
codified uh provides that medical claims
must be commenced within
four years after the occurrence
so clearly the filing in hamilton county
was after four years
there's no dispute on that right true
the
filing in butler county was within four
years well within four years but that's
as though it never happened right the
nullity theory
right and and if if you go down that
path um
then all of a sudden we can never apply
um the statute the the saving statute to
any case
wait a second it that comports with
antoon
does it not well we have no problem with
the n2
at least not today but we have no
problem with antoon today
and everything we're saying and all our
positions are entirely consistent with
both ruther and and tim
um yes there's a lot of supreme court
cases that remark
that once you voluntarily dismiss the
case it's as if it never exists but
that's that's
never been applied to an extreme so for
example
if you have an appeal in the first case
um it's remanded
and then the plane of voluntary dismiss
that case we don't we don't rip that
appellate decision out of the law books
it's still there it and if a defendant
makes an admission or any party makes it
admission
in the first case in a deposition um
they're stuck with that admission in the
second case as well what happened with
antoon
well with antoon this court didn't go to
the question of whether or not the
savings statute
applied i mean justice piffer pointed
out that would have been a really easy
quick and easy way to
to resolve antoon but that issue wasn't
resolved and for good reason you know
the case was already resolved in the
fact that they didn't meet the statutory
repose in the first place
well right it in in tune it was as
though it never happened it never
the first filings didn't save uh the
subsequent well there there's that that
sentence in antoine absolutely
but i don't think that was critical of
the decision at all it wasn't i mean
in tune was a procedural mess a lot of
it was filed pro se
um they just didn't satisfy the savings
statute in the first place
i mean here both claims were filed
within the four years
um so as justice stewart indicated
nothing was missed
um everybody was on notice they could
prepare a defense
um all the purpose of the statute were
satisfied
and and one thing i thought was really
interesting going through all this case
law was was judge monk's
concurring opinion in the mcneil case in
the first district
i mean judge monk looks at section c2 of
the statute of propose
it and i'm a paraphrasing here but he's
it
section c2 if an action is not commenced
in four years
any action upon that claim is barred and
he looks at the interaction between ann
and annie and says you know it's
contemplating future actions so the
converse is
if an action is filed within four years
then any action
on that claim is not barred um but
it does contemplate future filings and
future claims that's what what judge
monk said and remember he's just
one of several ohio judges now ohio
appellate judges
who have all gone our way on this i mean
there is no ohio appellate level judge
who has adopted the defense's
interpretation these statues nor is
there any federal judge
applying ohio law they've all gone our
way on this as well and i think that
does say a lot that
all these judges can read these statutes
harmoniously
and say like we can satisfy the purpose
of this one
we can satisfy the purpose of this one
they work together
there's no need for exceptions and
whatnot mr flowers uh
i i have a question it seems to me that
when the legislature wants these
savings statutes to apply to a statute
of repose
it knows how to do that and it does it
expressly
by referencing that exception to
whatever statute of repose
it's it's uh considering and it
certainly did that
with the products liability uh statute
of repose
so it and this obviously is one of your
your colleagues arguments
that when it wants when it wants the
statute uh
the savings statute to apply to a
statute of repose that knows how to do
that and it expressly does it
and it did it with the product's
liability it did not do it with respect
to a medical claim
why doesn't that indicate that
it intended for the savings statute not
to apply
right well that's what what
judge uh justice gorsuch and the u.s
supreme court referred to recently as
the canon of donut holes
um this idea that um because an
exception isn't there we're going to
make an
assumption from that or because specific
language doesn't exist we we
assume that they meant to exclude that
um as the first district recognized and
then they were citing in
the in tune or the the atwood case um
it's a real
poor measure of statutory interpretation
so what what justice is but it's a it's
a well-recognized one
uh it has been applied in many many
cases
at least in this state well this is
just justice gorsuch's decisions from
bostic versus georgia which came out
just
a couple of months ago it's the big
homosexual transgender
gender title vii case and he writes
nor is there any such thing as a canon
of donut holes
in which congress's failure to speak
directly to a specific case that falls
within a more general statutory rule
creates a tacit exception instead when
congress chooses not to include an
exception to a broad rule courts apply
the broad rule
and that's just basic straight statutory
interpretation is is
uh justice french was it was uh
expressing it it's just the words of the
statute
we're not going to worry about what
could have been in there what's in
something else
what what they might have done what they
could have done i mean you could play
that game both ways
um because you could say just as easily
well you know
saving statutes here was amended pretty
substantially in 2009
uh they didn't carve out an exception
exception for the statute of repose
um ergo that means they meant to include
the statute of repose within the savings
statute
i mean it you can play this game both
ways endlessly
and that's why it's just a very poor
indication of legislative intent which
we don't need
because these statutes aren't ambiguous
i mean the defendants kind of allude to
this in the brief they say if it's
ambiguous then this you know
they don't want to come out and say it
but it's easy to read
these words work together quite a few
ohio judges have already concluded that
that both of these statutes can be read
harmoniously
um together um and serve their purposes
so so you you you really don't have an
answer to the logic of the point i made
you you just don't like the point that's
what it sounds like to me
well not you know what i what i've
tried to say maybe not too eloquently is
that um
trying to pick out what legislature
could have done
what they could have excluded what they
could have included that's a game that
everybody can play
from both sides and we can play just as
easily as they can so
i'm urging the court not to go down that
road which the first district refused to
go down
um for good reason um now it's
interesting
the wade case and this is the 1986
decision from
from the 10th district that judge norris
wrote who's still
sitting on the sixth circuit today uh
the defense have completely
misinterpreted this because he says
he says you know there's an exception in
the statute
saving statute it doesn't apply here
here go
the saving statute applies to this
medical malpractice claim where we've
got a statute or opposed issue
you know that simple um and then he does
get into a little bit of this kind of
negativity reasoning after that
which he does get criticized for in
other courts
but that's way back in 1986 on that they
looked at this and said you know we're
just not going to speculate
as to what could be there what couldn't
be there because
all we really know from the legislature
is what they intended to do
which was make sure that we don't have
one
endless opportunities to file and two we
provide certainty
um and predictability for the defendants
we do know that also
they picked four years they for whatever
reason
they picked four years in order to
achieve that certainty uh give a window
large enough to accommodate some of the
vagaries that happen during
litigation and they say after four years
reading the statute no exceptions the
window shut
well right and it's four years to do
what and the answer is
four years to file a claim that was done
here
right it's not four years to get your
claim
counselor your claim was as though it
was never
filed in butler county uh
right you know as i indicated if if if
that's gonna be the holding then you're
gonna have to overrule freisinger i mean
a case that was unanimous
on that point and has stood for 33 years
without any legislative interference
fraizinger says council they said four
years
to prevent claims from coming out of the
blue
right exactly it's to prevent that sort
of surprise where all of a sudden you've
got
endless periods to file um it's hard for
the defendants to find witnesses and
gather evidence
after a lot of passage of time none of
that's a concern here
um because the the initial initial side
of the window was met
i mean that those claims were filed in
there everybody knew it was coming
and and dr durrani's choice was to flee
now that brings up another point which
is that
anything that happens here today is
going to be advisory um because
because he fled um right now the statute
of limitations
and the statute of oppose is being told
and
the tolling statute is very specific is
what it encompasses and it includes
uh the statute of repose but we don't
have that issue in front of us
correct well you know i always think
it's important for the court to to
keep in mind when advisory decisions are
being rendered i mean just
the decision rendered in our armco
versus public utility commission 1982
this court said
it is well settled that this court does
not indulge itself in advisory opinions
and that's what we're going to have here
because we go right back down and he's
still overseas
and the statute of proposals is still
going to be told um
so yes we're talking about important
legislative policies or whatnot but they
just aren't implicated here um first of
all because they were met second of all
because
we're gonna have these deadlines
extended perpetually um
just because he's overseas even though
there are other
defendants uh well the other defendants
are a different issue as
dr durrani you know he's the main one um
you know it's
he's he's the actual the main tort
feaser um the rest are corporations and
derivative liability
um but you know with that said um i
don't
you don't want to give up on anything i
still think it's important
as several ohio judges have now
indicated
and two federal judges have indicated uh
that you know you can read these
statutes together
um and when you do there's no need for
any exceptions to one or the other
they work together just on their plain
language
so with that we would ask you to firm
the first district court of appeals in
all respects thank you thank you mr
flowers
mr herzig thank you chief justice uh
several responses um first of all i
think
uh my colleague makes clear that
the only way for this court to rule in
their favor is to overrule
and tune if you met what you said in
entune paragraph
24 that an action uh is uh
as if it never commenced uh if the if
the action is dismissed it is
as if it never commenced uh then uh
the only the inexorable logical
conclusion
is that you have to measure the hamilton
county filing the new action not a
refiling a new action
uh against the statute of proposed and
they are outside of it
uh number two uh the cannon of donut
holes that uh
mr flowers reference doesn't apply here
uh as judge klatt was pointing out
uh here what you have is the general
assembly incorporating specific
exceptions
writing in section d a very detailed
exception
uh and then another statute showing how
it can in fact pull in
and refer directly to the savings
statute where it wants to
so it's this is not a case where we're
suggesting that
one exception here means no exceptions
elsewhere we're
just demonstrating that the general
assembly knew how to select from the
menu of options to
extend statutes and decided which ones
to apply to the medical malpractice
statute of proposal and which ones to
apply the savings statute finally i'll
say
that this opinion uh is not advisory
there may be more work for the courts
below to do after this court's
decision but a decision here affects uh
hundreds of cases that were
dismissed and refiled for strategic
purposes in this case
in an effort to create mass trials that
this court already had to
uh reject uh i see that i'm out of my
time
your honor i will simply ask the court
uh to reverse
uh the decision of the first district
consistent with its
decision in n2 thank you thank you
thank you gentlemen we'll take the
matter under advisement you'll be
notified of our decision
thank you
all right all right next do we have
counsel
there we go
all right great uh our next case is
2019-1325
in ray rb uh for the appellate
uh cross-appellate paula adams
good morning chief justice o'connor
justice's
counsel may it please the court i would
like to reserve
six minutes for rebuttal please since
this is a cross appeal
thank you this case involves the
first district court of appeals
misapplication of this court's decision
in
jean-baptiste it also
involves the first district's failure to
give any consideration to the general
assembly's specific
expansion of juvenile court
jurisdictions in these matters
as well as the extension of the length
of the court's
juvenile court's jurisdiction when it
comes to
the classification and the modification
and the review or the termination if we
will of a juvenile's
sex offender classification so i think
um certainly uh the amicus in this
matter
addressed uh the possibility of this
court being able
to reconsider or revisit jean-baptiste
but it's certainly the state of ohio's
position it's not entirely necessary
for that to occur because jean-baptiste
is
very distinguishable with from what
occurred here in that
the initial classification hearing under
2152
0.83 is what was involved in
jean-baptiste
and that is the statutory mechanism that
the state
is indicating provides the extension of
jurisdiction
when it comes to rb's case
the the statute's very specific that
the init once the initial classification
occurs
that continues until and unless
it is modified or terminated
so certainly i think that um if
this court were to want to reconsider
because
again in john baptiste that
some of those extensions and the
expansion
provisions those weren't at all
addressed in jean-baptiste but again
i don't think it's entirely necessary
that that occurred here
council council the initial
classification
happened uh uh when the case was being
uh resolved in juvenile court correct
yes your honor and he was then a tier
one uh
um uh reporter correct
correct and okay and so then
pardon me there was actually an
agreement that that was the appropriate
letter right
right i understand how that was resolved
and then he goes through several years
and there's
counseling and there's uh you know uh
non-reporting probation and a variety of
things that happen
and is it you say it would be
unnecessary for the trial court then to
have another
hearing prior to the uh
you know the end of the uh case prior to
him turning 21 uh for
the further duties for another
declaration of what his duties and
responsibilities are
for reporting no you're on i don't think
it's unnecessary
um and is it mandatory it is mandatory
that the hearing take place
but the timing the timing of that
hearing
and especially when you look at the
circumstances in this case
that the timing of the hearing is
directory um and i think that if we look
at
um you know that that's been well let me
let me stop you right there and see if
we agree on this
that there was an initial determination
uh and that followed him for the next uh
three four years right yes
okay and then it was incumbent upon the
court
to have another determination made
to define his duties and
responsibilities with regard to
reporting
going forward yes
okay and when did that second hearing
take place
okay well what we have here is an
attempt for that second hearing to take
place
around 2014. um and
and initially rb
had filed a ceiling application
uh with the court in 2014 and
the court said you know what at this
time you're not eligible
because we still have to have this
completion of disposition hearing
so from that moment forward subsequent
to that ceiling that that was
that was denied because they they still
needed to proceed on
uh the the um whether the classification
was going to be
maintained from that moment forward
it was rb who constantly once that
completion of disposition hearing got
scheduled it was rb
himself who had constantly been
challenging um the court's jurisdiction
or asking for continuance what
difference does that make
the court's in control of his schedule
correct but the court i think
in all regard understanding that
rb wanted to get this matter continued
to ultimately have the classification
removed
attempted to hold that hearing that
mandatory hearing that the court
knew it needed to have it wasn't that
the court was trying not to have the
hearing
the court was very patiently attempting
uh to complete this okay and again and
again you would agree
the court is the uh arbiter on when a
hearing will take place and could have
scheduled a hearing
within the time before he turned 21.
and it did it scheduled that hearing
multiple no no i could have held it
let's just say he could have
held it correct but when we talk about
fundamental fairness here when he's
asking for new evaluations
or new councils coming in um
at various times of this i i think that
we would have a fairness problem if the
court at that moment had forced
um that hearing um to occur when
they weren't ready for it i mean the rb
and his side weren't ready for it so i i
don't think that
um the way the court um
handled this matter was in any way
unfair at all
um i and i think that um
again there's been so many arguments in
this matter with regard to jurisdiction
and i think when the court looks at the
the voluminous
record in this case that jurisdiction
was constantly
uh being attacked and so the court was
stopping at each moment
to address those attacks and if we look
at
this historically this court's analysis
when it comes to whether or not um
the timing provision um that's provided
in statute is
mandatory versus directory i think the
the big indicator here
is that um loss of jurisdiction is never
specifically addressed isn't that really
the issue not whether it's
mandatory or directory but what the
remedy for the
if it can be mandatory but the question
is what the remedy is for the
trial court's failure to hold it when
uh it's required to do so does that i
agree with that
i mean what what why why why is that
juris
why would that be jurisdictional i mean
why would why would the remedy be
as in many cases court doesn't do
something they're supposed to do you
file it rid of mandamus
right and certainly in this scenario i i
i don't
believe that lack of jurisdiction is the
appropriate
uh remedy that the the fact that this
certainly it's subsumed within this
whole statutory provision
that this is going to continue on beyond
the the juvenile obtaining the age of
21.
um that that's you know from the get-go
that jurisdiction is expanded
and in fact i think if we look to um the
fact
that they even the general assembly even
um address the general relinquishment of
control of a child when they're
committed to dys
in when they amended this this statute
um
all other times that when a juvenile is
committed to dys
the juvenile court relinquishes control
but there was a specific exception
that's provided
um in in this whole statutory scheme and
i think that speaks volumes
um to the intent of the general assembly
is not for the juvenile court
um to lose jurisdiction to make these
modifications or terminations of the
juvenile even if they
turn 21 and i'd like to reserve the rest
of my time unless there's any other
questions
okay but before miss nestler starts i
neglected to
introduce judge eileen gallagher from
the 8th district court of appeals who's
sitting
in place of justice fischer who's
recused on this matter
welcome judge all right
miss nestler thank you
chief justice o'connor associate
justices may it please the court
my name is julie kars nessler and i
represent the appalling cross-appellant
rb
i'd like to reserve two minutes for
rebuttal
the state this morning has asserted that
really this case is about
whether a juvenile classification can
continue
beyond the age of 21. that's not the
issue in this case this case
this court has already decided that
issue in ds
this case is about the act of
classifying
the act of classification has to occur
at a time in which the juvenile court
has jurisdiction and with the authority
to act
the court has authority to act when the
statute is followed
was there wasn't a classification
already made here
your honor it was an initial
classification under
the juvenile the legislature enacted a
statutory scheme for imposing
classifications
the 0.83 initial classification alone is
not enough
well this this the scheme says uses
words like can choose to continue
modify so it seems like it's already
been classified here
your honor i would respectfully disagree
with that characterization the language
of the statute specifically makes clear
that that initial classification does
not remain
um does not continue without an
affirmative act by the juvenile court
that affirmative act is the hearing and
the classification order under point
eight
four and specifically under point eight
four
where does the statute say that here
your honor it says specifically in
subsection a
it says that the judge shall conduct a
hearing to determine if the
classification should be continued right
but where does it say the part about it
doesn't continue
i think that's that's how your honor it
has to be read
into that so it doesn't say that but
that's
what you read that to me well yeah yes
your honor because it's a statutory
scheme
each piece is an important puzzle to the
classification
um the the classification is a two-step
process
if the legislature would have intended
for the .83
initial classification to them enough
then
they would not have included 0.84 in
this statutory scheme but they did so it
has to have meaning
these two provisions have to be read
together they work in tandem
further the uh state has relied upon
subsection e um to and to argue that
they have a continuation of jurisdiction
that reliance is misplaced if you review
that subsection
that subsection only indicates that the
order that will continue
not that the act of classification and
the act of jurisdiction
to classify is what continues and um
addition moreover again it says that the
8-3 hearing is quote subject to
0.84 once again it's not a complete
process without that 0.84 hearing
um if we consider as miss adams was
describing
uh the attempts by rb to continue
the hearing isn't part of the problem
here
that we had those kinds of continuance
requests
happening so what should the what should
the judge have done
in in this situation then sure your
honor as an initial
matter uh first is the mandatory duty on
the part of the court
they're in control of this secondly the
statements characterize characterized
the record in this case the juvenile
court did indeed
docket uh rb's case for completion of
disposition hearing
in 2014. however he did not make assert
um
that hearing did not happen at that time
rather in 2015 april 2015 to be exact
the juvenile court quote withdrew the
issue of reclassification
that was on the juvenile court um then
we went on from 2015
2016. it was not until the state
filed the motion to hold a completion of
disposition hearing
that the issue of a completion
disposition here became
at issue again and it was at that time
that rb
um that he challenged the court's
jurisdiction
i think also your honor to answer your
question is that importantly
um this statute the legislature was
cleared intentional
in choosing disposition to be the
triggering event
for these hearings um the court is in
control of that disposition the
disposition is the tether
from the court to the juvenile what what
does that mean
when you say at the completion of
disposition what is the timing
that day that day your honor so it has
to be that day
that would be rv's position your honor
that provides so
so if the disposition ends
on his 21st birthday
uh i suppose this position isn't
completed until
11 59 of uh of the
uh day before or uh so
so when's the court hold the p the
hearing
hearing that case correct so your honor
again
the juvenile court it controls when the
disposition terminates
so they can terminate the disposition on
the same day
and they hold the hearing that same day
as well
they can do it earlier too though i mean
the end date is his 21st birthday they
could do it when he's
20 and a half they could do it at any
point they want to reevaluate
um or you know take into consider
consideration um
you know what uh they conduct a hearing
of the effectiveness of the disposition
and any treatment provided to the child
determination of risk and all the other
factors that the judge has to take into
consideration at a dispositional hearing
does not have to be done on its 21st
birthday absolutely not your honor
you're absolutely correct again
but but you but it does have to be done
and you're reading on the exact day that
the disposition ends
yes yes right so the dispositions uh
set to end on a sunday this court the
court has to come in hold the
disposition that day
again your honor the juvenile court is
the one that controls the disposition
what if the child is sick on the day
that the disposition sets in
again again your honor that is within
the providence of the juvenile court
it's not within the problems that
juvenile court if if the juvenile goes
to the hospital the day that the
disposition is supposed to end
but your honor the disposition ends when
the juvenile court says
it ends so they can extend that
disposition out
and therefore extend the court's
jurisdiction the
uh again i wanted to relate back to the
are you saying they can extend it past
21
no your honor 21 enter on that yes
i'm sorry your honor i didn't
i didn't hear your question i said be
clear on that you said they can just
you know extend it that's not you've got
to qualify that
okay your honor if i so the age 21 is
the outermost bound
this is similar to what this court
recently found in um in ray aw
age 21 is the the absolute last time
that this court
is the time the court uses jurisdiction
so the day before is the absolute last
time that the court could
do complete the act of classifying so
for um so i know that age 21 plays a
role because of the facts of this
particular case
but for most youth it is going to be
earlier than that it could be
15 16 17. it all depends on what the
disposition
was ordered for that youth and the point
that i was trying to make
uh justice dewine is that the juvenile
court is the one that
terminates that disposition think i
underst i understand that
but i mean it seems a little impractical
to say okay
you've been ordered to complete this
program the program ends on a certain
day i
i set this order for this position in a
certain day
and if the court does is not available
to conduct a hearing on that very day
uh then under your under your theory
there's no jurisdiction over
the juvenile no your honor that's not
our theory um
again what you said has to be done on
the day of the completion of disposition
correction but you're what you're saying
is that treatment was the end of the
disposition
but for a situation like what the
hypothetical you are posing
typically that would require a child to
be under orders of probation
and so okay so i'm a judge i put i put
the i put him on
juvenile on community control for two
years it ends on
january 3rd 2020. i either have to
hold the hearing that day which
technically isn't
even the completion of disposition under
your theory
it would have to be i guess under your
theory it have to be the exact instant
the disposition
ends or uh the court forever loses the
ability to
hold that hearing it can't hold it
before and it can't hold it after
correct you're under this and where does
the statute say that
your honor this is a we're talking about
the juvenile courts
which are courts of limited jurisdiction
well i i understand that but where does
the statute say
that it has to be done the exact instant
the disposition ends i mean
we we use upon the completion of
all the time uh and typically we don't
say that has to be asked me that day
well your honor again
this court in in interpreting the
juvenile sex offender
statutes and nraia and nrads
and john baptiste the issue was always
does the court have statutory authority
to
do the act in ia it was to do the
initial classification
under 0.83b in ds it was when can you
determine the age jurisdiction
the jurisdiction is tied to the
statutory authority
and you have to follow the statute to be
vested with jurisdiction
that's specifically what this court
found in
the age 21 is the outermost bound to
that jurisdiction if you don't hold the
hearing and don't continue the process
for classification
before the age of 21 that classification
is rendered and valid it's just like an
aw it's just like in
john gutie's and that's why this court
should affirm the first district's
decision
that's one of the basis there's an
additional basis for rb
and that is that he completed his
disposition in 2013
and his hearing should have ha that
happened at that time
his disposition was entered december 2nd
2011.
he was placed on probation in order to
complete
treatment at ultracrest he completed
that residential treatment and
on february 6 2013 he
remained on probation supervision and
aftercare
until the juvenile court they were the
ones who took the action
they are the ones who completed found
that he um
determinated his probation that is the
moment that july
29 2013 is the moment he completed his
disposition
and the moment that the juvenile court
had jurisdiction under .84
to have the end of this position hearing
they did not do that therefore they
lacked
jurisdiction to continue again the
legislature was
quite clear that this is a pro this is a
full process or a full
scheme each piece has to be complied
with
in order to enter a valid classification
the fatal
the fatal error in this case is the
juvenile court
failed to continue rb's classification
as required by 84 at a time in which it
had jurisdiction
again he rb turned 21 on july
20th 2017. the juvenile court did not
continue that classification
until three months later on october 30th
2017
clearly outside the bounds of their
jurisdiction the classification
has to be rendered void additionally as
i said
the salient issue here for all juveniles
in ohio is when must this completion of
disposition carry occur
and that completion of this position
that hearing has to occur at the same
time
it's practical i know it's practical
the court knows where the kid is at that
time can bring that in
can provide they have the records to
allow them to be a well-informed
fact-finder
this case provides the clear example of
what happens
if that hearing is delayed here rv
was unable to there is no um he was
unable to present
evidence related to the people that were
intimately involved in his treatment
the entire purpose of this hearing is to
review the effectiveness of his
treatment
he cannot have a meaningful hearing when
the witnesses that were involved in that
treatment
are unable to be located and are
or if they are located or unwilling to
testify because it's been four years
from his treatment and i think that's
important to reiterate one more time
neuron
is that the treatment that rb received
in this case
it was four years from the time the
court reviewed him that is not what the
legislature intended
that's not what this court envisioned in
n raid ds when it said that these
children would get a procedural
protection
to ensure that these classifications
only remain when it's
necessary or the child hasn't been
rehabilitated
the the system failed rb in this case
um and that leads me to
rv's cross appeal again in order to
have due process and the promise
provided by this court in ds there had
been
a meaningful hearing and there just
simply wasn't um additionally it's quite
clear that he was prejudiced
not only was rb did he lose an
opportunity
for removal but excuse me you filed you
filed a cross appeal in this case
um and i was i was a little concerned
that you filed then you filed a reply
brief
but the reply brief didn't deal with the
cross appeal
it it was another it was essentially a
sir reply on the merits what should we
do with that that's
you know that's not allowed by the rules
should we strike that brief should we
not consider the argument she raised in
there
no your honor i think because the due
process
claim intertwines with well this wasn't
this wasn't about the due process
claiming you
directly addressed what you you directly
replied to the reply brief
that's well your honor well beyond the
scope of what you're allowed to do and
you're
our our cross appeal there's two
arguments the
first argument is that you must comply
with the statute
so we are reiterating the same things of
why the statute was not complied with
the alternative argument is that if you
agree that the statute was complied with
that simply due process was not complied
with in this case
so that is why there that um that reply
you have to agree that goes well that
the arguments you made go
go well beyond your cross appeal i mean
there was
statutory arguments that responded and
it absolutely
is better and what i'm trying to and
again
it is because part of our constitutional
argument is the failure to comply with
that statute
also violates due process um i just
briefly i wanted to mention again
that rv was you used your time your you
have no time left
sadness uh yes your honor first i'd like
to point out that
all of the case law um and i think we
can all agree on this
it is only involving that initial
classification hearing under uh 2152.83
and that is what distinguishes here
um that statute specifically says
that the order continues the court's
jurisdiction
to reconsider to to modify
to review that initial classification
of continues beyond the age of 21. so
all of the case law
um is not applicable this really is a
case of first impression when we talk
about the review hearing
and and very clearly this is a review
hearing it's not a new classification
hearing
that the court is not allowed to then go
back and say
oh no you're you're you can either go
down a tier
or not at all um the court couldn't
change the tier to a tier three at that
point so this is not a new
classification hearing it it's
clearly a review hearing and it the the
court i
i think are you saying that the the
judge is limited
as to what the judge will in that
uh hearing a post-disposition
uh cannot relieve the uh
minor of the duty to report yes they can
they can remove they can't foundation
yes they can remove the classification
you're saying they can't go from a one
to a three
right they can't enhance okay right so
so i'd say that whether the
classification
sticks and you've got a duty for
reporting or
the judge can remove it and you are free
of the
uh duty is a pretty important hearing to
have
it is your honor and that's why it's
important for the juvenile
court to to get it right um they they
have
uh and and this is the goes to the
entire purpose
um of the general assembly creating
these layers
um the court this is this is an
individual who committed
some pretty serious sex offenses at the
age of 14 years old
so the juvenile court has another seven
years
um to to deal with this individual
um so it's certainly and there were
multiple layers here he had
um an inpatient treatment program
and i certainly don't think that it
would be at all wise for a court to once
they're
they've they finished that uh that
period of treatment
to to then make the consideration of
whether or not they need to
to to register um later on what what is
prudent here is
is exactly what the court did is let
let's
you know phase back phase back each each
time
you know as to what his disposition is
he gets
put he gets finishes his treatment then
he's on a period of
um monitoring with the electronic
monitoring
than just probation and then ultimately
down to
the non-reporting probation with
monitored time
in encompassed within each step of this
disposition
is the fact that he's supposed to
register and he didn't even do that in
2015 he stopped registering and then we
have an intervening adult
prosecution for that failure to register
which is then
based upon and again that eats up some
more time for the juvenile court because
certainly they're not
in a position to intervene while an
adult um
prosecution's ongoing so i think if we
look and this is a
voluminous record again it spans
multiple years
but everything the court did
was in all respect very
fair um to rb and i think if you look
back at that
in 2014 i think the trial court very
well
or the magistrate very well may have
wanted to consider
that application uh to seal but couldn't
so let's let's start the process that's
what the the court was
at all um every step wanted to to go
ahead and have that hearing
they didn't have to have it at that
moment that thought okay
why don't we bring you in we'll we'll
hold that into disposition or that
completion of disposition hearing um
start start the process
but excuse me for interrupting
the the word that i get concerned about
in your proposition of law
is the word permanent do you really mean
permanent well i think that
um yes for the the fact that we had the
initial
classification here um in most cases
certainly we're not going to stretch
beyond the age of
of 21 unless it's absolutely necessary
i think that that's that's very apparent
from the magistrate very much
wanted to hold the hearing
um before his 21st birthday um that that
was
very that's very clear um in the
transcripts
so i the the word permanent and that
came from
um a dissent that we had from another
first district case
um here that i think that it it
it makes it clearer um to all the
juvenile courts as well as
the appellate court that it's the once
you have that initial classification
hearing
that they do have the ability to engage
in
a meaningful review of the
classification and make sure they get it
right
um that that certainly that that
jurisdiction is going to
um continue on until they can re
reasonably hold that completion of um
disposition review hearing and that's
the reason for the word permanent even
if it's 10 years out
15 years out i mean i i guess there's
there's
got to be something something smaller
than permanent and i think encompassed
within
obviously when we're talking about a
tier one person
that's going to be 10 years yeah so
certainly you know maybe permanent for
his life
no but for that duration of what the
duty lasts
that makes sense i'm sorry i misspoke or
misworded that yeah
thank you for your honor why why do you
believe that
the juvenile court was
divested of jurisdiction while there was
a pending
common police court general division
action
on the failure to report their lateral
they could run laterally i'm sorry i'm
having
trouble hearing i am
curious as to why you believe that the
juvenile court could not handle any
matters while the common police court
general division
had a pending indictment for failure to
report
well i don't think that i i don't know
of any
legal um i just i think that while
during the pendency of that for the
court
to then go and have a hearing that could
affect
um that i don't know that logistically i
don't know how that would
um that would transpire um legally
whether or not
you know they could actually go in and
they're courts of equal jurisdiction
there so i i don't know
legally or technically how that is but i
i just i
i think that again it goes to the
reasonableness that the
juvenile court was operating under in
this case and the fairness
so without the state would ask that this
court reversed the first district's
decision in this matter thank you
thank you
uh miss nessler did you uh reserve time
did i hear
you did your honor um i was out of time
used all your time i'll give you 30
seconds
thank your honor um in this case um the
0.84 hearing
is the of the utmost importance it is
not only the hearing that just
that decides whether or not the penalty
continues but
it decides whether or not that goes into
adulthood
and it's all the collateral consequences
that come and therefore we ask that this
court to hold that in order to have
jurisdiction to continue the
classification
the court must hold the hearing at the
time the child completes the position
and before the child attains age 21
they'd also ask this court to affirm the
first district's decision thank you
thank you you'll take the matter under
advisement you'll be notified i'm
notified of our decision marcia will you
call a recess please
the court will now take a brief recess

all right our next case is 19-1430 state
of ohio versus sean doughty
uh for the poet
yes your honor chief justice o'connor
may please the court my name is frank
silesnakar
i'm an assistant prosecutor attorney for
cuyahoga county and i'll be representing
the state of ohio in this matter
i'd like to reserve five minutes for
rebuttal your honors
a 20 year to life sentence and a
sentence of life with pro-eligibility
after 20 years
is the same sentence both are indefinite
life sentences
both uh allow a convicted offender with
pro-eligibility after 20 years
and both sentences comply with the
general assembly's intent
that offenders convicted of aggravated
murder and sentenced pursuant to 2929
a1b serve life sentences with parole
eligibility
after 20 years and that's exactly what
happened in this case
mr dowdy was convicted of aggravated
murder
and and with a three-year firearm
specification
as well as uh an offensive kidnapping
he was sentenced ten years on the
kidnapping charge and he was sentenced
to 20 years to life
on the aggravated murder charge with the
three-year
firearms specifications now
he did not appeal from that sentence
rather he waited a few years and he
filed a motion to vacate his void
sentence
concerning the aggravated murder charge
the trial court denied that motion
and he didn't denied that motion and on
appeal the eighth district
voided his sentence on his aggravated
murder charge
um simply by saying why why isn't the
issue that he didn't
that he didn't file an appeal from his
sentence why doesn't that just
end the matter recent decision hudson uh
the case no exactly i was gonna i was
gonna get to that after the eighth
district's decision in this case
this court revisited its void
voidable jurisprudence and held that um
any sentencing issues imposed by a
from a from a trial court that has
subject matter jurisdiction
and subject matter sticks in personal
jurisdiction over the parties
uh the defendant is required to raise
those issues on direct appeal
he didn't raise those issues on direct
appeal and therefore they should be
barred by the doctrine of race judicata
since he did not raise this issue on
direct appeal
um so yeah so uh so i believe that
they are barred by race judicata based
on this court's recent jurisprudence
in hudson and harper now even if we were
to get to the substance
of this of this case um the sentence
there is no error
there is no error to appeal for
in in eppley's merit brief eppley
concedes that
sentencing when imposing a sentence a
trial court is not required to
impose make a rote recitation
of the actual statute so long as the
statute complies with the general
assembly's attempt um
the trial court has not substituted its
sentence for the sense of the general
assembly and in this case as i discussed
above
the intent of the general assembly in
this case was for offenders convicted of
aggravated murder
to be had be get a life sentence with
parole eligibility after 20 years
and that's exactly what we have in this
case so the question before this court
regarding the substance
is whether or not there is any sort of
substantive difference
between 20 years to life and life with
parole eligibility after 20 years
and there simply isn't the exact same
sentence well council is there
such a sentence as 20 years to life
not in the statute no that there's
actually no like
it's not a verbatin recitation in the
in the orc the orc says life with
pro-eligibility after 20 years
but 20 years to life is for all intents
and purposes
is the exact same sentence the trial
court was not required to make a verb
voting recitation of the actual statute
um
now i've been asking what is the actual
practical difference between the two and
there is none
um in his merit brief aptly makes the
argument that
by imposing a sentence 20 years to life
the trial court essentially took in
a definite sentence and converted it
into a
indefinite sense and that's simply not
true all one has to do
is look at the definitions in black's
law dictionary of what is a definite
sentence and what is it that
is an indefinite sentence and black's
law dictionary defines a definite
sentence
as a sentence for a fixed length of time
rather than for an unspecified
duration neither one of these sentences
20 years to life or life with pro
eligibility after 20 years
is for a fixed amount of time they're
both life sentences
with pro eligibility after 20 years they
can be reduced by the parole board
after he served the minimum 20 years in
fact
of these sentences are indefinite
sentences
um black's law dictionary defines
indefinite sentence as a maximum prison
term
that the parole board can be reduced
through statutory authorization
after the inmate has served the minimum
time required by law
therefore they're both indefinite
sentences since they both are
senses of a max of life
that can be reduced once the defendant
serves 20 years now
for years trial courts have been
uh have used these phrases
interchangeably when imposing
a sentence for aggravated murder trial
courts have said
life with pro-eligibility after 20 years
or 20 years to life
when imposing a sentence for murder they
said
15 years to life life with
pro-eligibility after 15 years
this is pretty commonplace and in fact
that that actually happened in this
case when sean doughty was initially
sentenced on his first sentencing
the trial court imposed a sentence of
life with pro-eligibility after 20 years
his plea was eventually vacated on
appeal and when he was re-sentenced
years later in 2013 that's when we had
this sentence the court imposed
20 years to life i mean there's
really never been an issue until
recently in the eighth district
has started starting with their case in
a state versus kemp
and state versus smith they basically
said if the court does not make
essentially follow the verbatim the
statute verbatim
then the sentence is void also as that
has that
uh practice then been adopted uh in your
jurisdiction
uh where judges are more careful in uh
voicing
exactly what the sentence is um i
i would like this i would like to think
so but you still have we still have
situations where
courts still use them interchangeably
it's only been really since the smith
case
that it's really taking on a lot of
steam in the trial courts and now trial
courts are really getting inundated with
these
with these motions and i'm sure they're
aware of
of this of this case but we're still
having situations where
they they use them interchangeably you
know
so so that that that's an issue
um so so that yeah that so i
i would like to think that they are
they've been more cognizant of that but
at the end of the day
like i've been arguing they're the same
sentence one way or the other 20 years
of life and life with pro eligibility
after 20 years is the same thing and to
vacate these sentences
a lot of these sentences being decades
old
15 years 10 years 20 years old
to have these inmates be able to vacate
their sentences and then have to hold
brand new lenovo re-sensing hearings on
the aggravated murder charge
not only is a waste of judicial
resources because we're bringing in
these defendants
vacating their senses solely so the
trial court can impose the exact same
sentence
but just worded differently and not only
that
i mean it reopens old wounds for the
victims
families who have to sit through another
sentencing hearing
or 20 years down the line they get a
call from a prosecutor informing them
that
the person so i i you know we are a
profession where words matter
yes whether lawyers judges um
statute drafters words matter
and you know the what
causes me a little concern is that you
said that the
practice in the eighth district given
the cases that have been decided by the
eighth district court of appeals
have not been a cautionary tale for the
for the judges in your jurisdiction
they continue to use in in precise uh
sentencing language
well i mean yes i mean that that's an
issue and we are
like as prosecutors when we're in the in
the sentencing uh hearings we're
doing our best we can to well are you
are you in the sentencing hearings at
all times is there a prosecutor present
in the sentencing hearings
uh generally yes especially for
sentences of aggravated murder and
murder
okay and then it would be up to well it
shouldn't be up to but it is a duty of
the prosecutor to make sure the judge is
pronouncing the correct sentence is it
not
exactly yes i agree and they should
follow the pursuant to the
uh the eighth district's um opinions so
yeah that's definitely something that is
a responsibility of the
the prosecutor and when that falls
through the cracks
i mean uh we have to deal with it on
appeal
and my my position is that when that
does happen when a court does
send someone to 20 years to life rather
than life with parole as good after 20
years
it's the same sentence there's no
practical there's no practical
difference between the sentence
is this court held recently in state
versus benella
concerning consecutive sentences this
court
made it clear that talismanic wordings
are not
really necessary at sentencings so long
as
the intent of the legislature is
complied with
the uh so long as the tense of the
legislators complied with the
trial court hasn't substituted its own
sentence
for that of the one provided by the
general assembly
and here 20 years the life in life with
parole eligibility after 20 years
is the exact same sentence there's no
indication of the
trial court like replacing its own sense
with the one provided for by the
uh the legislature um if there's any
other questions i would just uh
ask to save the balance of my time for a
rebuttal
thank you mr martin
made please the court john martin on
behalf of mr dowdy
my friend says there's no difference
two words no difference i have two words
in response and that is to whom
and it's that to whom the fact is that
the question is not whether it makes a
difference
to anybody other than the general
assembly
because this court following its
traditional jurisprudence recognizes
that it is the general assembly that
defines punishment
and so if i may this morning i'd like to
talk about
three things one is there
a statutory extinction between
20 to life and life with parole
eligibility at 20.
second i would like to talk
about whether or not that distinction
implicates void versus voidness
and then third i would like to talk
about the practical effect
the statutory distinction
if we look at 292902
it lays out penalties for murder and for
aggravated murder
and the general assembly says ag murder
either death or life imprisonment
murder 15 to life imprisonment
and then we move over to 29 2903
and it talks about the fact that that
life imprisonment
can come with parole eligibility
but in 2929.03 and we cite the statute
at length and
at pages five and six of our brief and
at 2929.03
c1 a little v
you have a situation where we see that
in first of all in four it says
that when this is dealing with ag murder
where there was a death spec
and the jury comes back without death
and they say that subject to the
following subsection
quote life imprisonment with parole
eligibility after serving
30 full years of imprisonment so that's
one of
the penalties that the general assembly
recognizes
and then in part roman five
little v if you will it goes on and it
talks about the fact that if you have a
victim that's less than 13 years of
age and you have certain uh predator
specs and the like
that the sentence is not that it can't
be
that one it is an indefinite term
consisting of a minimum term of 30 years
and a maximum term of life
so here we have in the exact same
subsection of a single statute the
general assembly using two different
terms
and when the general assembly uses two
different terms
we presume that they have
two different meanings the eighth
district has done nothing but apply
this court's traditional statutory
interpretation jurisprudence in looking
at that and and i might point out that
kemp and i i don't know what this is
worth but
if nothing else anecdotally kemp was
written by judge kenneth rocco
who had himself been a six-year member i
believe or
about six-year member of the general
assembly so we have
a former state representative who's
drawing this distinction between hey
wait a minute
definite indefinite okay now is it a
definite
term if you have life with parole
eligibility
after 30 years or after 20 years in my
client's case
mr zelaznakar does a good job of telling
you that
in black's law dictionary that doesn't
make a difference
but again to whom to the general
assembly this court must presume it did
make a difference
because they used the two terms in
different places now if it makes a
difference to the general assembly
then the next question that comes up is
well what about void and voidness what
am i going to do about the fact that
this court has decided harper
and hudson here's why
harper and hudson are distinguishable
harper and hudson which were both prc
cases
both involved cases where the judge had
the authority to impose
prc did it imperfectly
but nonetheless had the authority to do
that
but in this situation if we recognize
that to the general assembly
life with parole is different than
20 to life then we're in a situation
where
it makes it then the general assembly
has not said the judge can do both it
can
can impose either it's been very
specific as to which one
and i i realize that one of the
questions that comes up is am i just
playing games with talismanic phrases
the answer is no see this isn't a
question of saying you have to use the
exact words
but what you cannot do is to substitute
one legal term for another legal term
and then turn around and say well it
doesn't really make a difference
and therefore all martin's doing is
saying talismanic phrases
no i'm not i'm saying that when words
matter
legal terms that are distinctly used in
different places of a statute
themselves also matter
now if we don't limit
harper and hudson in the manner
that i'm going that i'm for which i'm
advocating
we run into the following problem let's
say that we take
harper and harp and harper does this
wonderful job of taking us all the way
back to
state x-ray and really developing the
whole line of jurisprudence
but in talking about the jurisdiction
of the trial court i think it's
important to remember
and this was not an issue in in harper
or in hudson
that the general assembly when it
confers
jurisdiction on a trial court
it gives it two different lines of
authority
the authority to try the case and the
authority to punish
see it's this authority to punish that's
the problem here for the state of ohio
because the general assembly has not
ordained the trial court
to punish aggravated murder
in this case with a 20 to life it is
only ordained the trial court
to punish with life
with the parole eligibility which in
this case happened to have been imposed
at 20 years
and so when the general assembly uses
two different terms
and then in its conference of
authority to the trial court to go
forward and do our work
it does not give them the authority to
go
beyond those statutory parameters if
that were the case
then we could have the situation where a
common police court judge
who sentences a defendant for
the theft of a loaf of bread is a petty
offense and gives him
20 years and we would say well that's
voidable
and if you didn't catch that in the
general if you didn't catch that in the
journal entry
then in fact it's too bad you're going
to have to do 20 years
on the petty offense and that cannot be
and we know from the line of cases that
harper cites
that are rid of habeas corpus doesn't
lie traditionally
in that kind of a situation well if a
writ of habeas corpus doesn't lie and if
we look at the constitution and the
other ritz that are available
mandamus prosedendo prohibition quo
oronto
none of those fit so there has to be a
way
for the state of ohio to be able to
avoid that type
of injustice and it is through the void
sentence
doctrine used in limited
in in limited doses and that limited
dose
that limited dose comes in saying
trial judge could you have done this
anyway if the answer to that question is
no
then the sentence is void trial judge
could you have done this
but you just did it the wrong way
avoidable
and that's a distinction that allows
harper and hudson
to make great strides for judicial
economy
without violating 14th amendment due
process
so if i could let me move then to my
third point
and my third point is does it make a
difference and i
talked in my brief at the very end
about the idea that it sends a different
message to the parole board
the glass half empty glass half full but
i want to be a little bit more concrete
than that
this morning if i may and no i'm
let me just say right now i haven't
found a place
where somebody's serving 20 to life
is different than life after 20. but
here's what i have found
and i cited a supplemental authority i
gave i
cited to the court state x-ray davis
versus janus and that was a rip case
that you decided back in april
about 20 full versus 20 to life
okay 20 full to life or parole after 20
full versus parole after 20.
those were two different sentences in
that case
correct that that's that's not the
equivalent of what we have here
no it's not your honor and and i want to
make sure that i i
i'm not trying to suggest that but what
i want to point out to the court i used
that case
only to provide the factual background
to look at
some one of the pieces of authority that
was cited by both parties and that was
oac 5120-2-10
and 5120-2-10 gets into the issues about
good
time in those in in and when it's going
to be treated and in 5120-2-10
b it talks about that 20 to life
li and 24 and then it says
and you know from janus that that's a
question that was a matter of a
statutory mandate
that you're supposed to do one in one
place as your honors as
mr justice dewine points out those are
two distinct sentences
and then the but look at what they say
at the very end of that they say look
we're gonna treat any sentence
of uh to aggravated murders we're gonna
presume it to be a sentence of life with
parole eligibility after 20
unless the journal entry says something
different
so we see that the executive branch
is saying look if it's in the journal
entry
we're gonna follow that whether that was
a legal sentence or not all janice did
was to give perspective to what was
being said there
and and the point is this if
the executive branch is going to be
following what the trial court
journalizes what the trial court says
what happens if down the road and this
has not happened yet
but i can't come back to you in 30 years
the good lord willing i could even be
able to
and say to you
my client is not getting good time
and since the time that i was here the
last time your honors
the oac has been changed and there's
good
time in life cases
but there's not good time in cases
involving
indefinite sentences or there's a
different calculation
of good time in one setting versus good
time in another
and it made a difference and so the
problem here is this if the general
assembly is going to use two different
terms
then respectfully we presume they make a
difference
and we see that the executive branch in
the past has said
or present has said we're going to look
at that journal entry
we're not going to look at the statute
we're going to look at the journal entry
and if the judge said it was indefinite
in this case they were talking about 20
like from 20 full but the point being
the oac has shown that the executive
branch will be guided
by the journal entry and if down the
road there are changes if the parole
board takes a different
attitude and says you know when it's 20
to life that's different than life with
parole eligibility after 20.
regardless of which way they they they
have that
arrow point if they say there's a
difference in
if the oac turns around and says we're
going to treat
good time differently and we've got a
journal entry that's wrong
then my client does suffer
so at the end of the day
the general assembly makes the laws they
pick the words
trial judges shouldn't be turning around
and ignoring
one term of art not term of art legal
term
for another legal term and then
we have the fact that the executive
branch
rightfully so looks to a trial court's
journal entry
when it decides how it will enforce the
law
this is not a situation and this is a
situation where
all of this happens where a trial judge
acts without that authority
that has to be conferred by the general
assembly
in the end to whom
is the distinction and this court
employing traditional separation of
powers
should recognize the primordial role
of the general assembly in making the
law if there are no further questions
i thank the court for its time thank you
mr zelen carr you have six
let's see how much longer do you have
four minutes and 19 seconds left
thank you your honor um i'd like to talk
about the janus case because
he brings up a good point in the janus
case
the janus case if you look at paragraph
seven through eight of the janus case
that was the situation
where the trial court by
family by including the term fool
into its term actually changed the
sentence there was an actual substance
change the court recognized that by when
when
the term full is in the sentence it
precludes the defendant from getting
things like
good time credit or joining programs so
that was an actual substantive
difference
what i didn't hear through during his
um argument was how 20 years to life
in life with parole's ability after 20
years are two different sentences
they're just clearly not they might be
phrased differently but they're the same
thing
and if you look at the ohio
administrative code
you'll hide administrative code
recognizes
that like even though a sentence for
murder is 15 years to life
and a sentence for aggravated murder is
life with parole eligibility after 20
years
when you look at the ohio administrative
code under uh
5120-2-10g
which governs murder sentences it states
um a prisoner serving an indefinite term
of imprisonment of 15 years of life for
the offense of murder
becomes eligible for parole
consideration after the 15-year minimum
sentence
now when you look at the ohio
administrative code uh
governing aggravated murder 5120-2-10
k it basically says the
same thing it says a prisoner serving a
sentence of imprisonment for an
offensive aggravated murder committed on
or after
july first 1996 becomes eligible for all
after serving x number of years so the
admin ohio administrative code doesn't
make that same distinction the uh
the um general assembly did in
in their in in between murder and
aggravated murder sentences
there just isn't any sort of distinction
and what i hadn't heard
during mr martin's um argument was
how this sentence of 20 years to life
affected mr mr dowdy
in any substantive way he's it's still
an indefinite sentence regardless of
whether or not
the uh i mean mr martin makes the
argument that the general assembly
intended
the life of pro-eligibility to be a
definite sentence
just on the face of it it's clearly not
a definite sentence
regardless of any anyway the general
assembly didn't even define it as a
definite or a definite sentence that's
just
speculation on mr martin's argument it's
clearly a
indefinite sentence pursuant to the
standard well-recognized definition of
what an indefinite
sentence is so they're both definite
indefinite sentences
mr dowdy is going to be eligible for
parole after serving the minimum term of
20 years and this clearly complies with
the
general assembly's intent that a
definite scent
of of that a offender being convicted of
aggravated murder and sentence pursuant
to
2929.03 a1b
he's sentenced to a life term with
parole eligibility
after 20 years there's simply no
substantive difference between the two
sentences
now mr martin also brought up the harper
argument
and i think i i introduced as
supplemental authority a recent case
uh decided in june by the eighth
district i think it's state versus
brooks
where they basically said an issue like
this and it cited harper and hudson
and in that case i believe the defendant
was arguing that the court
included or didn't include the term full
years when imposing a sentence
and the eighth district in that decision
relying on this kurt's case in harper
said that this is barred by racism and
he could have raised it on direct appeal
and he chose not to
so the eighth district has already
determined that uh
harper's not just limited to challenges
of post-release control
um so i would just ask this honor to
recognize that 20 years of life in life
with pro eligibility after 20 years are
the same sentence
they're both in definite sentences and
the indefendant in both cases will be
eligible for parole
eligibility after 20 years so if there's
no further questions i would just
ask this court to reverse the judgment
and opinion of the 8th district court of
appeals
thank you thank you gentlemen we'll take
the matter under advisement you'll be
notified of our decision
thank you
okay
all right our last case this morning is
2019-1815
john reichster receiver on behalf of
certified steel stud
association incorporated versus william
gardner and edward
and clark weston dietrich building
dba clark beatrice
versus certified stud association
uh for the appellants we're going to
have a time
split i believe according to my notes
the first
uh attorney to address the court is
james helmer
okay christine lee court
chief justice o'connor associate
justices and
counsel for the defense i'm jim helmer
from cincinnati
and i represent john reister the
court-appointed receiver in this case
i'm going to split my time with matt
lickensurfer who's counsel for clark
dietrich
he'll take five minutes and of the
remaining 10 minutes i'd like to reserve
two for rebuttal
this case presents a straightforward
issue to the court
concerning the scope of this court's
litigation privilege
does that privilege shield corporate
fiduciary directors
from suit by their own corporations when
they breach their fiduciary duties
to their corporation it's a receiver's
position that such an expansion of the
privilege by this court
would be wrong for three reasons
first expanding the privilege beyond
defamation
is inconsistent with this court's prior
rulings
and contrary to the purposes behind the
rule
second such expansion disrupts
long-standing established corporate
fiduciary duties
with which directors must always comply
and third such expansion is unnecessary
because the statutory business judgment
rule
in both delaware and ohio already
protects directors
first in the last 100 years
this court has considered many times
whether a litigation privilege should
bar
a lawsuit one of the briefs in this case
says that that's happened on four
occasions
i actually counted seven such cases by
this court
and every single one of them involved
defamation
the receiver does not bring a defamation
case so what is this privilege
the this court's determined on several
occasions that statements made in the
course of the judicial proceeding
are absolutely privileged against a
civil suit
so long as the statement is relevant
and material to the original proceeding
to aid the court in its search for the
truth now the court of appeals in this
case
relied upon language in this court's
srirachi opinion
are quote recently related to the
litigation unquote
as the basis to expand this privilege
but reasonably related to the litigation
is a
term of art which has been defined by
this court
many times justin o'connor as you say
words matter and they matter here
reasonably related to the litigation
does not mean
anything having to do with the lawsuit
is protected by the privilege
the phrase means that to trigger the
privilege
the statement or conduct must be
essential
to proving or disproving the point to be
established in the underlying lawsuit
so as to aid the court in the search for
the truth
if it is not essential or germane
to proving the point it is not
privileged
here the search for the truth in the
underlying lawsuit
concerned whether certified steel had
commercially disparaged clark dietrich's
steel products
deciding whether to settle a lawsuit has
nothing to do with aiding the court
to determine if clark's products have
been commercially disparaged
settlement discussions do not prove or
disprove whether commercial
disparagement has occurred
so we have no defamation follow on
lawsuit
in this case the settlement decision
which is that issue had nothing to do
with seeking the truth
of the underlying disparagement lawsuit
this case in that regard is very similar
to another case decided by this court
willister versus the mcleod dr mcleod
was an
expert witness doing out of court
medical exams to prepare his testimony
to uh for presenting to an industrial
commission
court found no privileged protection for
that
like willister here the directors were
sued
not for any testimony instead it was
further out of court
conduct committed at a board meeting in
breach of their corporate fiduciary
duties
had nothing to do with the search for
the truth of whether
commercial disparagement had occurred
directors breach of their fiduciary
duties
at a board meeting simply does not aid
the court
in the truth-seeking function for the
underlying lawsuit
council i recognize that that certainly
is one of the purposes
is to is to get at the truth
uh but what about uh the other the other
issue that your
friends on the other side ray uh raise
which is to prevent
a flood of follow-on litigation
uh to to give a definite end that that
you shouldn't see
additional liability based on something
that you did in in
one case how do you respond
you're under that is a red herring in my
view because there is no flood of
litigation
for for these issues well would you
agree though that that is one of the
purposes
for the litigation privilege for the
litigation immunity
i would not agree that's a purpose at
all i would agree that that is a benefit
that has been
acknowledged by this court and uh by
other courts around the country
that it would stop litigation but
for the reasons that i'm about to get
into this litigation should not be
stopped
well but that isn't that a different
question i mean what we're
thinking about is really how are we
going to apply this
looking prospectively in every case
rather than
how are we going to apply it in this
particular case
well the first point was it should be
applied in defamation cases
only but if you're going to expand it
beyond defamation cases
then you should use the test that this
court's already enunciated
which is has to be reasonably related to
the litigation
and if it's not then the
privilege could apply and there wouldn't
be any affordable litigation
how could settlement discussions not be
reasonably related to the litigation
because as that term is defined it has
to either prove or disprove
the underlying issue in the lawsuit
settlement discussions nobody admits to
anything in settlement discussion they
don't approve or disprove anything
so as we if you applied this court's
definition
then they would not be covered by the
privilege
thank you secondly your honor
the directors are fiduciaries as a
matter of law to certified steel
the receiver pled that their fiduciary
duties were breached
and this court must assume that
fiduciary duties aren't like a light
switch that get turned on and off
they are unremitting and constant
they do not cease at the courthouse do
door
and finally your honor and my time is
about to run out
providing the absolute meaning here is
unnecessary
because both delaware and ohio recognize
a business judgment rule
that protects decisions by directors
assumes they're made in good faith but
it's a rebuttable presumption
and in egregious cases like this one
that presumption can be rebutted
the appeals court decision here not only
nullifies corporate fiduciary duties for
directors
it also eradicates the business judgment
rule
i would defer to mr brookes lincoln
surfer at this time
council chief justice o'connor and mid
please the court
justice o'connor and may have pleased
the court on matt lickenster for on
behalf of clark western dietrich

known as clark dietrich uh i'd like to
take five minutes of the remaining time
without reserving any of that for
rebuttal at justice french i'd like to
start with
with your question to mr helmer about uh
the benefits of
follow-on litigation and i think one of
the responses to that question
is as mr homer said that may be a
benefit of the litigation privilege
but it is it's not a a good way to
define the scope of the litigation
privilege
and that is because there are other
doctrines
that address and solve the problem of
follow-on litigation
within the given context of a particular
tort
in this context of our case that problem
is addressed by the
business judgment rule the presumption
against
second-guessing director decisions
discourages follow-on litigation
and acts to eliminate a lot of such
litigation at a very
early stage when it has not been
discouraged in the first place
other tort theories such as professional
negligence
that might come in this context also
have elements to them that are
make follow-on claims hard in the first
instance and so uh yes it's a it's a
reasonable policy consideration to think
about follow-on litigation
and finality of litigation but we
already have other doctrines that
address that problem
and in grafting that goal onto the
litigation privilege
creates problems it creates problems
because the litigation privilege is an
absolute immunity that prevents even the
inquiry into the underlying conduct
and that fundamentally is the problem
with the 12th district's rule here
and also with the position being
advocated
uh by the defense their rule
would preclude even inquiring
into a breach of fury duty in the
context of litigation
interpreted literally as the descent
below
indicated the 12th district's rule would
preclude
any inquiry even inquiry
into professional negligence claims in
the context of litigation
your honors that can't be the law of
ohio
and it's not the law in other
jurisdictions either
and other jurisdictions have taken three
general approaches to addressing
this kind of issue that is corralling a
litigation privilege that sweeps to
some states and the restatement adhere
to the traditional rule
so that the litigation privilege applies
only to defamation claims
other states have expanded the the array
of
which the privilege applies but they
keep them limited to those that found in
defamation
that is claims alleging a reputable or
psychological
injury arising out of litigation
testimony or evidence
still other states have a broader rule
that's articulated generally for the
privilege
but then carve out exceptions or impose
significantly
limitations on the otherwise broad scope
of their general rule
the most common of those exceptions is
one for professional negligence claims
and that's based on the common sense
idea that the litigation privilege
isn't to prevent a principle from suing
its own
agent for negligence or misconduct in
context of litigation
and that exception provides a very nice
analogy to this case
some other states have carved out other
exceptions to another
rule and have done what the senate judge
below proposed
which is limiting the claims to which
the privilege applies
to those that are brought by a party
opponent
in the underlying litigation and that
kind of exception
also addresses the concern that you
raised just as french
both of those exceptions that states
have carved out to
you know broad general scope definitions
of the litigation privilege
uh exhibit a point that are that's very
relevant here
and that is the litigation privilege
should not be used to deny recourse to a
litigant
who has been wronged by the agent or
representative
of that litigant any of those options
that other states have chosen would
solve the fundamental problem here of a
privilege that sweeps too broadly
we think the one sounding uh limiting
the scope to those
sounding and defamation makes the most
sense your honors for the reasons we've
articulated in the
in our breathe at the end of my time
your honors and i will
yield the balance for mr helmer's
rebuttal
thank you all right all right for the
employee i guess first we're going to
have mr pollock
yes chief justice justice o'connor
associate justices it's a privilege to
appear here
for you today i'd like to address two
issues one that the litigation privilege
does apply
and two that even if the court were to
go to the business judgment rule
that the receiver has failed to state a
claim
in this regard i'm going to narrow
myself solely to what the receiver
actually pled mr helmer makes additional
arguments today
but i'm going to receive i'm going to
narrow myself to literally what he
played
page 2 paragraph 2 page 6 paragraph 16
what he pleads is that the cssa opposed
a motion to dismiss and instead
insisted upon the having the jury decide
the matter he does that by requesting a
vote
so he's responding to judge faith and by
the way at that time chip and ed
this is chip gardner my client ed slish
koeppelli
were parties they were the cssa a
corporation speaks to its
representatives
and at that point they were responding
directly to a judicial inquiry
and they said we want to have the jury
rule that is absolutely i've just stated
a prima facie case
of the litigation privilege because
they're litigants in the course of a
case
and they're responding to a judicial
question so with regard to wilitzer
which mr helmer grasps onto
bullets here is an odd case because it
deals with a private medical exam being
done
apparently for a labor dispute but the
court there had a 4-3 split it was a
closely decided
divided supreme court of ohio and they
drew the following line
it was an investigative medical function
not a quasi-judicial function
asking for the jury to rule is as close
as you can conceivably get to the
litigation process
mr helmer then argues well
it's a narrow rule it really doesn't
apply here but suraji tells us it's a
liberal immunity
rule of immunity it extends to every
communication at every step in the
course of litigation
complaint to the end further pleadings
and statements and this was a pleading
we want to have the jury rule
is protected perjury is protected
clearly in derogation of the
truth-finding process but this court is
found as others have to and that's
schmidt versus statistics
stole versus kennedy that perjury is
protected
as is bad faith statements so the
narrowing that mr blickensterford and mr
helmer attempt really is not true the
fact is this court has embraced
a broad rule all along mr mr
let me excuse me um let me
let me ask give you this hypothetical
suppose the directors of
procter gamble decide that all this
consumer products
making is too much work and instead
they're going to devote
all their corporations resource to
patent litigation
suit people who they think are breaching
their path their patents
and a few months later they announced
they announced the decision their stock
price plummets
wouldn't would they would they not be
liable
could they not be sued for breach of
fiduciary duty uh
two answers your honor um if you don't
let me change your fact that i'm just
slightly
now just watch answer this fact pattern
let's stick to this one
i like coca-cola which is why i put on
weight but if they tried new coke it was
a horrible disaster
if they came back to new cove or they go
and decide they want to focus on
litigation
there is a great question about whether
they've acted appropriately under the
business judgment rule perhaps if the
stock prices plummet
right the question the question is and
let's go back to my hypothetical these
are this
is i think akin to what we have here
which is a decision
whether or not to continue or pursue
litigation
uh with the directors in that example
under your reading of ohio law would
they be entitled to a litigation
privilege these were
decisions about litigation well i don't
know where they'd be decided
they'd be entitled to litigation because
it's not made
in the courtroom directly related to
litigation is somewhat related as a
business decision business discussion
if we look at the business judgment rule
which would be well
but i think we need to talk about the
privilege though that's that's kind of
the that's the issue we accepted
uh what
you say the difference is that they
weren't in the courtroom in that what
imagine for example uh the directors in
the courtroom
uh they get a very reasonable
settlement offer uh maybe uh
and the directors decide that they've
hired their brother
one of the director's brother-in-law to
continue the litigation
he's making a lot of money uh they don't
they don't want to
accept the excellent offer because they
want him to continue to get paid in this
case
is is there a breach of fiduciary duty
claim there may well be but the
i mean but what's the difference under
your version of the privilege if it's
immune if it immunizes these decisions
whether to accept settlement offers to
go forward with
litigation why would it apply
because in the case where a corporate
board is still informed and makes a bad
decision because it's just not informed
or makes a decision out of bias
and it it's not making it in the court
it's making it in the board room
if you will it's making a business
decision there may well be a breach of
fiduciary duty but no
so it depends on the look how the board
sitting when they make the decision
no but your honor respectfully they were
at six weeks and into a jury trial
they're sitting there on sunday night
they get approached at nine pm
and they have to make a decision as a
board what do we do
they then actually accept the offer the
following day so exactly what the
receiver complains about they then did
that is a little different than coming
up with the idea of selling poison
as a board and deciding you know we're
going to bypass the fda rules
right but but but you're asking us to
adopt a rule that would apply to all
those situations i mean
i'm not respecting your honor give me
the contours of the privilege that you
would like us to
uh i think we fixed glare within
litigation privilege
in this case it was a statement in
response to a court
in the courtroom because their lawyer
was there in the courtroom
they were negotiating in the courtroom
they responded monday morning to the
court
that is very different than some you
know if you will contrive
corporate conspiracy where the
corporations acting in its own
self-interest or bias if you will okay
so
so should should we have a privilege but
not
the reasonably related privilege to the
litigation that the lower court had
i think it has to be reasonably related
saying i want to have the jury rule
is as reasonably related as statement as
you can get
okay but but i was trying to understand
what your standard would be
because we're gonna have to make a
decision if we're going to
have a standard we have to articulate it
so right your honor
my respectful suggestion would have been
and i know it's up to this court
is that the wheels of justice turn slow
but mighty fine
mr blick and stripper throws out and
they've thrown out the idea of
lawyers assaulting judges and you know
people assaulting witnesses
i can't deal with that fact pattern
because right now i'm not asking for a
grand rule i think the dissent got it
wrong here
all the people but do you think the
majority got it wrong because the
majority
articulate a grand rule that would cover
those situations
i think the i think the majority got it
right because they were applying it
to this fact pattern i don't think they
were trying to resolve
a just a rule that applies to every case
everywhere
they the fact pattern they were posed
with was on the eve of trial
litigants decide that they want to have
the jury rule
that's the fact pattern they got they
weren't asked about these other cases
and so to me perhaps it comes with a
different different scenario but
corporation acts in its own
self-interest but the fact is that's a
little different than the fact pattern
we've got and i think the facts make a
difference
does that answer your question your
honor um
not really but i think
i apologize justice i certainly am i'm
trying i'm not trying to avoid your
question
um with regard to the so regarding the
majority rule this majority this court
has filed a majority rule on the
restatement
um ever since 1930 restatement one two
and three
this case falls squarely within three
statement of torts
the purpose here of course is to make
sure that every witness can testify
if we accept the rule that they're
articulating here then the witnesses
would not be able to testify because
everyone will be terrified
if they walk into ohio they're not going
to have both the litigation privilege
and the business judgment rule
nothing requires them to just choose
between the two
lastly as justice francis french noted
the idea is to end litigation not to
promote it
i one last point before i hand off the
baton to scott ratchik and of course i'm
here to answer your questions
looking again at the receiver's
complaint page 8 paragraph 27
page 11 paragraph 42 page 1247 he says
something very specific each time
he says that the cssa members chip and
ed
were acting in the interest of their
member companies as a matter of law
he has just failed to state a claim the
reason is we're governed by delaware law
and delaware law says their duty was to
the member companies to this
if that's the case why wouldn't we just
remand it to the court of appeals to
apply the business judgment rule if
you're correct they would their conduct
would be immunized into the business
judgment rule
well that's certainly one possibility of
justice dewine the
other possibility again i don't think
you even get to the business judgment
rule
because if we accept the proposition
that they were answering a question
from the court as parties and the cssa
was a party and they say we want to hear
the jury rule
then that would render them completely
immunized but if we go back down
certainly if you get to the right now
the court could look at it and say
we look at the complaint he fails to
state a claim
therefore i think the trial court in the
appellate court got it correct
good morning madam chief justice
justices of the court may please the
court my name is scott ratchik and i am
co-counsel for apelli
edward slish justice dewine let me take
up your question
under your hypothetical i would argue
two things one if the decisions
were made outside of the context of
a proceeding meaning before a litigation
was
filed there's case law that suggests
those actions are not protected by the
privilege including for example
woolitzer which suggests that activities
undertaken
before a litigation is filed are not
protected the same is
true in the page capital case if the
actions that you described were taken
in the course and scope of and were
reasonably related to the
active litigation or judicial proceeding
i would argue
your honor that yes the privilege does
apply
so if so if directors are blatantly
self-dealing if they reject to sell an
offer because they want
their brother-in-law's law firm to make
more money
they there's there's there's no
fiduciary claim that can be inserted
against them
your honor and i will answer that
question and then bring us back to these
facts
but under the circumstances that you
just raised there are other alternatives
for recovery
from by that corporation they can go
after the brothers they can
fire the director they can uh
whether or not there are other sanctions
that might be available
uh the answer is they can pursue those
but they can't go after the director for
breaching his fiduciary obligation too
in the context of the litigation
privilege that would be correct your
honor
and but we don't have those facts here
and to reiterate what mr pollock said
we are dealing with these facts here the
rule
may not be a perfect rule but this court
has acknowledged
that it's not a perfect rule and in both
willitzer
and under uh soros in particular
this court has made it very very clear
that conduct which otherwise would be
actionable
is to escape liability because the
defendant is acting in furtherance of
some
important uh social interest
and additionally that although the
result may be harsh in some instances
and a party to a lawsuit may possibly be
harmed without legal recourse
on balance a liberal rule of absolute
immunity is the better policy as it
prevents endless lawsuits
those are the words of this court so
justice dewine while you
posture a hypothetical to us that is
on the extreme edges
i would say that that falls squarely
within the precedent of this
court recognizing that that injustice
may occur in limited situations
just as the appellants suggest
that a ruling in their favor or a ruling
in our favor is going
to create assault and battery in the
courtroom and witness
tampering and all of those things
couldn't we accomplish the same thing
by uh putting this in the context of the
business judgment rule explaining that
well
maybe there's no litigation privilege
the business judgment rule
provides uh broad project protections
for good faith decisions about whether
to continue litigation
you could your honor but that's not what
the
litigation privilege is intended to do
it is intended as justice french alluded
to earlier
to end uh follow-on lawsuits and to
allow
participants in a judicial proceeding
to act and to speak
as zealously as they can
so that and they can do so without
fear of follow-on lawsuits
but this isn't really about speaking
zealously right it's about
it's about the problem i have here is
we're not talking about speaking
zealously in litigation we're talking
about
decisions making
that would ordinarily seem like
fiduciary decisions
but you're going to do a speech in
litigation
well the decisions here were actually
spoken
one the decision almost
yes but how much more communication can
we have
than in this case where they're accused
and i understand my time is
running up if i might uh finish your
question
um the decision
here was that they're being accused of
is opposing a motion to dismiss
and that communication that decision
and that argument to the court is what
is
centrally at issue here uh as mr [ __ ]
alluded to
that's what the cause of action is here
so
i would argue to you where more can you
get either
one a communication two
as just as french alluded to earlier
seeking the truth
how much more truth oriented can you get
than we want the jury to decide
and so justice dewine while i understand
you're looking for a broad rule
i'm not sure that this is the case
that can give you the opportunity for a
broad rule
but what this case does afford you
is an opportunity to properly apply the
litigation privilege
to the facts of this case
where the directors instead of uh
doing any of the parade of horribles
that are noted
simply said to the court we want the
court to decide
they had an independent judge with the
ability
to regulate that courtroom thank you
council
council thank you okay
you've used your time thank you your
honor
all right mr helmer you have uh looks
like a minute and 47 seconds
thank you your honor uh justice dewine
you were told that we failed to state a
claim in this case
and that remaining this case could
solve the problem the problem with that
your honor is the trial court
was specifically asked to rule on that
issue
and did rule on that issue and did
determine the receiver stated a cause of
action
that was not appealed by either these
directors although
they did appeal other issues they didn't
appeal that issue
justice french as to ending litigation
after listening to mr ratchek i'm sure
you're now convinced
that with all these other remedies that
corporate directors would have that he
claims they would have
litigation wouldn't be in it at all it
just would be moved to a different
courtroom
next your honor you were told that this
settlement offer was accepted by
certified steel and if you look in the
brief
you're going to see the only citation to
that is our complaint at paragraph
17. we do not say that because
that's not true finally
this decision was like the procter and
gamble
hypothetical was made in the boardroom
it was made the night before in the
boardroom
that turned down this golden ticket
settlement and as a result
certified steel got hit with a 43
million dollar jury verdict
that it cannot pay it's
the trial judge that handled this case
did supervise it
and he's the one that not only warned
council of their breach of
potential breach of fiduciary duty he
appointed john reister as a receiver
to look into that issue investigated and
litigated
we ask that you reverse the decision of
the court of appeals
thank you thank you gentlemen we'll take
the matter under advisement you'll be
notified of our decision
making honor thank you for your honor
marshall
marshall will you adjourn court please
hear ye
hear ye hear ye this open session of the
honorable supreme court of ohio
now stands adjourned
you
