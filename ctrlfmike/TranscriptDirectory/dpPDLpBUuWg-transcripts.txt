good afternoon everyone
i think this has been a very uh hopeful
week
across this country certainly here in
ohio
uh with the news about the vaccine
coming
we're very excited about that we hope to
see this beginning in
december i hope to start getting out in
december
to our most vulnerable population and
then
as soon as it gets here uh it's going to
come in batches and as soon as these
batches come we're going to
get it out but until then
we have to wait and we have to continue
to battle this
this virus you'll see by today's numbers
um that things are getting worse
uh and they're just going up at a huge
huge
rate so we've got to get control of this
uh
we've gotta really focus on it i i
quoted
a quote attributed to winston churchill
last night that when you're going
through hell
keep going and that's what we've got to
do
this is a time when we've got to kind of
regroup
and say we can get through this um
i'm not a marathon runner so my kids
have run marathons
but uh you know they tell me when you
get well into it
you think i've already done all this
but i got i got a ways to go and that's
maybe in some respects the toughest
the toughest time so but we can do this
we will in fact do it
some people have asked me today well
what's the takeaway from last night's
speech and you know i think that really
is it
it's hope um we're going to get through
this
there is light at the end we can see the
spring coming we can see the sun coming
up
where it's not there yet and we've got
to get there and we've got to get there
and save as many lives as we can we've
got to get there
keep our economy moving keep our kids in
school
these are all the things that are goals
that we have to stay
focused on and
it remains the most important thing that
we can do and the thing that will really
matter the most is frankly if we're
careful and we wear a mask
we just have to continue to to do that
so some of the things we talked about
last night are really kind of focused on
that
i talked about how important it is for
a worker in a retail store
to be sure that they're as safe as they
can be
and for us to ensure that we have to
make sure that everyone that comes in
to that store is in fact wearing wearing
a mask
now look there's i got questions during
the night
um text to me emails or is there an
exception for medical exceptions or
certainly
um you know every mask order that we put
out has medical exceptions so i want to
assure everybody
but it's important for that worker who
has to work
that they be protected it's equally
important for someone
who's going out shopping that they know
that no matter what store they walk into
people they are going to be wearing
masks
that's very very very important we
talked
last night about sadly some of the
tragedy that has come out of banquets
come out of weddings come out of
funerals not the events themselves
but whether the party the coming
together
horrible horrible tragedies and and
we've got to slow those down
uh we're not telling people you know
don't have a celebration
uh that's individuals choice i know some
people are postponing those until it's
over with they're gonna have a even
better
celebration uh and you certainly could
do that but if people wanna have the
celebration they can do it
but you know we're gonna put out the
basic guidelines and they're gonna be
exactly what i think we all know we're a
mask
um you know if it's if it's uh a banquet
a wedding reception and you're gonna
actually have that
okay uh but people need to follow kind
of the rules that we see in restaurants
that we put in
regard to restaurants and that's keeping
people remain seated
you know people not congregate really uh
very close together
just the basic cautions
it's not worth someone's life it's not
worth someone dying
we can do things but we've got to do
them in a very very careful
careful way we also talked about bars
and restaurants now of course i
expected i've got a lot of feedback in
regard to bars and restaurants
look we've not made a final decision on
that
we're going to be guided by a lot by
what our hospitals are telling us
because this is a really a critical a
critical point
we're seeing some real increases in the
hospitals we'll
look at the numbers here in a minute
we'll make that decision as we get
closer
to it people say why restaurants
why bars why not this why not that why
not that
i understand that the answer to that is
this it's winter
late fall getting colder not a bad day
today but people are moving
obviously moving inside uh it makes any
inside activity more difficult more
dangerous potentially
what's unique about bars and restaurants
as well as
fitness centers is for a great deal of
time people are not wearing masks we
understand that you can't
can't eat and have a mask on or drink
but we also know people there sometimes
for a long time
and so it's the time what we've learned
is it's the time it's not wearing the
mask
this is what raises the risk makes it
much much more risky
so we'll have more of that we'll see
where these numbers go
but what my hope is from last night
and all our other discussions and just
people seeing what's what's really going
on in ohio
my hope my prayer is that we all will be
more careful
while we're mass more and if we do
i think the evidence shows we can slow
this down
we can in fact turn this around
so let's uh michael let's look at the
numbers
uh today's daily numbers sadly continue
our growing trend and you'll see
on the numbers we'll get them up here in
a moment
uh cases so now we're over 7 100. you
can see the 21 day average is 4
000. so over 7 000 cases
a new high des 34
hospitalizations 268 again both of these
numbers as you see are larger than the
21 day average
uh icu admissions are not they're about
the same at 21.
but obviously we don't like to see that
number
um we have our this is gave us our
second
highest day of hospital admissions with
286 people getting admitted
to the hospital let's go to the
our 88 counties slide
again this this is a slide that
if you want to know what the danger
level is
in your county right now this is the
best slide
to look at you can see sadly because
it's
it is the color blue every single county
in ohio now
every single county is a high incidence
county
and if you go back down here to the
bottom carroll county
even carroll county at the lowest number
is almost two times
um what the cdc says
is a high incidence level so it's double
high incident level even for our lowest
county
michael let's go to the next one uh
this is the top again the top 20 and
again when you look at these numbers
uh putnam county these are just
astronomical numbers mercer county
auglaise
allen defiance miami
these counties up in the northern part
of the state northwest part of the state
very very high even down to miami is six
times the high incidence level
so these are indicators of
what is going on directly in the county
as far as the
as far as the spread
michael let's go to the next slide the
next few slides have to do
with really what are is coming up these
are the
what i would call the predictor slides
and again
uh not good news covid related uh
outpatient visits seven day average
you're seeing right here
what is what is going on in regard to
that
um trend is similar to those we're
seeing for case counts
uh in our hospitals
covertly emergency department visits
take a look at
that one graph shows a seven-day moving
average of cover related emergency
department visits
graph on the left shows ed visits with a
diagnosis of covet-like symptoms
the graph on the right shows the number
of emergency department visits with a
confirmed diagnosis
of cova 19. both graphs show an alarming
trend
and our emergency departments are facing
more cases than they have during this
entire
pandemic again these are the warning
signs not good
let's turn to the daily hospitalization
icu admissions by date reported
these fill in they fill in
as by date of actual admission because
that data is not always available uh the
blue line shows the number of patients
hospitalized with cova
19. the orange line indicates the number
of coven 19 diagnosed patients that are
intensive care unit
as you can see we are currently at our
highest point for both
hospitalized and icu patients since the
beginning
of the pandemic
let me go to the next slide we often
hear people say
the increase in cases all that's just
caused by more testing and we are having
more testing but as you can see
from the slide
increase in testing is here
see what's happened there this one
however
is an increased increase in cases and
what you're seeing is a rather dramatic
increase here a good increase here but
not anything like
like that
this is the 20th week of the ohio public
health advisory
system and michael let's go to the next
slide on that
and this shows last week
to this week again a couple things to
note
more counties red now down to only one
yellow
the whole state is basically pretty much
filling in
uh with this exception here and a couple
here
uh with with red so
again i would advise people
you're in a red county whatever county
you're in look at
the slide we showed you before which is
how many cases
there are michael let's go the next one
we'll go to the next slide
again this is where this is where we are
today
um we designed this system
really to give a good indication of what
was coming
uh but when most everything in ohio is
filled in
the value probably of these
color code is not really as as
significant
getting to the purple uh indicates and
we're not the purple although we have
two counties that have
the the uh alarm signal put up
that they could be going there next week
that is really an indication directly
what's going on
with with our hospitals so two things
really to look at now
number of cases in your county per 100
000 population
and what's going on frankly in regard to
the hospitals
68 of our counties are now red franklin
tuscaroras counties are on
our watch list today's new red counties
are brown county delaware
erie hancock jackson knox
miami paulding seneca shelby
williams and wood eight of those
counties are read
for the first time in franklin county in
tuscaroras county
six of the seven alert system indicators
were flagged this week that means of
that continues
growth that they would turn purple next
week
both counties are seeing a high number
of cases a high percentage of cases
spreading in the community
and sustained increases in cases
and three health care utilization
measures emergency
room visits outpatient visits and
hospital missions of residents
with with coven
let's go to
something that we're going to be
introducing we don't have a slide for
this today
but we are introducing something that i
think will give you
uh more specific details particularly if
you live
in a larger county and that is the
ability to go to your zip code
and go right down and see what exactly
is going on we're introducing two new
dashboards on the coronavirus website
the first is a zip code dashboard
this latest release of data continues
our commitment
to giving you the most information we
can as soon as we can
users will be able to view data from
their local communities on a map
and they can filter by probable or
confirmed case
status by county there'll be a specific
zip code or a time period such as cases
during the past two weeks
30 days or the entire pandemic so you
can go down and just drill what i would
suggest people do
when you look at this look at the two
weeks because that gives you what
is the last 14 days and gives you an
idea of what has been going on
case counts will also be available on a
downloadable
filter chart sorted from the highest
cases to the least
to predict confidentiality we aren't
showing case counts for zip codes with
fewer than five cases or less than 100
total resonance that won't will not
impact most of you
uh the next dashboard that we're
introducing today is a flu
dashboard uh a new flu dashboard that
will be on the department of
health website this dashboard expands
statewide seasonal
flu activity that the department of
health shares each year
so they always put out some information
this is going to expand it
this dashboard shows flu trends over
time with charts that indicate whether
flu hospitalizations or cases of
flu-like illness
are on the rise or decline compared to
the previous week
and compared to the five-year average
to that date hospitalization data is
broken down by region
county date sex age race
the data shows only positive flu pcr
tests reported by public health
laboratories and selected clinical
laboratories that participate in the
national
flu monitoring system additional data
will be added moving forward the
dashboard will be updated every friday
at 9 00 a.m so again we urge everyone
to get a flu shot it's very early in the
flu season we can't really tell uh
how severe this season yet is going to
be but we
ask everybody to get a flu shot and
you'll be able to follow
this again and see what's going on
in your in your community in regard to
how widespread
the flu is
our health departments have been at the
forefront of this battle
and as we look to the future and see
what we have to do
to be able to successfully battle this
virus
making sure that our 113 health
departments
have the proper funding is something
that's very
very important and i have committed to
every health commissioner in the state
uh that we will be there for them
because they're at the front line
throughout this pandemic there's been
assistance available through cares act
funding we're
saying today that help is on the way
with the assistance and the help and the
partnership
of the state legislature and i thank
them
we're setting aside 30 million dollars
to assist ohio's 113 local health
departments
each department will receive 200 000
dollars
and they will have flexibility to
determine how best to use these funds
as they fight coveted the remaining
money
from the 30 million will be used to hire
contact tracers to support local health
departments we'll do this at the state
level
but then they are available to surge in
when a county really needs help we're
continuing to hire people now
and i've told our team do it just as
fast as we can
we'll continue to offer state resources
and support to help fight cobia 19
at the local level and again i want to
thank our health departments every
worker out there
who's at the front line thank you so
very very much
uh for what you're doing i just got off
the phone with kentucky governor
bashir andy and i talk quite often
usually it's about covet today it was
about a bridge
i want to talk a little bit about what
happened yesterday
crash on the brent spence bridge of
course is the main transportation
quarter between
cincinnati and northern kentucky
damages from the accident are very
severe
the bridge is now closed inspectors were
there
this morning could get onto the bridge
then and cool enough
that is is going on at this time
we expect i've talked with jack marsh
banks the ohio department of
transportation
we expect that review to continue at
least
into and through saturday and we'll see
what
inspectors come up with we know the
importance of this bridge and getting it
back up
but we also are dedicated both governors
are dedicated to making sure it's safe
and that no one's gonna go on there
until we're we feel safe about taking
our own families on there so we ask for
patience
uh for people uh as we as we move
forward
uh with with that
let me now move to uh lieutenant
governor john
thanks governor uh i wanted to just give
a quick
update and reminder about the small
business relief grant
we put this made this available a few
weeks ago
to employers with 25 employees or less
it's 125 million dollars in which we
will provide
ten thousand dollar grants to these
small businesses for
mortgage rent utility payments salaries
wages
the things that you you need to keep to
keep the doors open
and to keep things moving forward we set
aside
five hundred thousand dollars per county
so that it wasn't
uh so that every county got a chance to
participate
um and what we found though where we at
right now is we have a few counties
that haven't used up their 50 company
allocation
we have 13 counties vinton harrison
adams hardin preble noble monroe
fayette carroll morrow brown
morgan and wyandotte so there's still
money available for small businesses
in those counties to apply we encourage
you
to go to businesshelp.ohio.gov
to apply for those monies uh they're in
the process right now of processing
those applications
and and getting grants out to businesses
but in these counties
there's still money available and so for
our friends in the media
if you cover those counties please help
us make sure that the businesses
in those communities know about it so
that we can
make sure that they're getting the
assistance that we know they so
very much need i also will add that
the bar and restaurant assistance fund
is another option where we
made available 38 million dollars for
two thousand five hundred dollar
assistance payments for on-premises
liquor permit holders
the department of commerce tells me that
we've only had about a third of our
licensees
apply for that money so far and you can
make sure that you get your uh
assistance payment of twenty five
hundred dollars by going to
businesshelp.ohio.gov
and this is an opportunity for the ohio
department of commerce and the
development
services agency please make sure that
you
take advantage of those resources as we
know
it's difficult for small businesses and
everybody during this time
i also um want to thank everybody who's
out there across the state who's
sacrificing and working hard
as of late uh health care workers we
know how challenging your jobs are those
working in nursing homes
we we appreciate your efforts and and i
know our team internally
has worked hard at trying to to deliver
information to you
uh the media to the public and uh even
the zip code data and the flu data that
you s that you now
are being made available today uh
through the the dashboard
all of that is due to the hard work of
of our tech team
and uh the center for digital government
has has
given the state of ohio in a uh for the
2020 digital
survey of states uh there were only five
states
check check five states to receive an a
and um
i was surprised frankly because we're
just getting started we're going to be
able to do a lot more
to support these efforts this was
triggered with the creation of the
innovate ohio platform through our team
innovate ohio
and the governor's executive order last
year that required
the uh agencies to put their data on
that platform
thankfully the ohio department of health
was one of the first ones to do it
so that enabled us to uh to
move their data to the cloud uh migrate
that data the correct the cloud which
enabled us to create the
coronavirus.ohio.gov dashboard which we
have been getting information out to all
of you on uh and
being one of five states to receive an a
there were only four
that were recognized for their for de
for data governance and transparency as
as being the top states in the country
and ohio
was one of those so i want to thank the
the data team
they work so hard at the department of
health with the folks at the innovate
ohio
uh the innovate ohio team to make sure
that they're delivering this information
that they're protecting privacy
i know we have a long way to go to get
where we want to be but i just wanted to
to thank those teams for what they do to
to help get that information out to
people
i hope you'll take advantage of the new
data at the zip code level
i find it very interesting and helpful
to really gauge what's going on in your
community so
uh thanks governor i'll turn it back
over to you well lieutenant governor
thank you very much thanks for your
leadership
in regard to this governments i i think
historically um don't keep
up many times in regard to getting data
out
and we have an obligation to get out to
the public
as you said john we have a ways to go we
know that
uh but we're proud at least of the
progress that we have made
in in regard to this and it's important
i think
as people discuss public policy issues
to be able to pull down information
whether it's the public whether it's the
news media and again
we're not perfect we know we've got a
long ways to go but i think by
which you heard from john you can see
that we are making some progress
in regard to that and you know the
information we're going to continue as
we announce today with two new
dashboards
we're going to continue to try to put
information up uh and make it
just as reliable as certainly as we can
we're ready to go to questions governor
first question today is from jim
province at the toledo blade
hi governor thanks again for this
briefing appreciate it
your administration is still in the
courts in some cases
appealing decisions by judges that found
that you or your health director
overstepped your authority
when it came to prior orders affecting
gyms etc
how would those be affected now by new
orders that in some cases might double
down on what judges said you aren't you
don't have the authority to do
well i'm gonna i can't really answer
that um
we've got we've been sued a lot i've
been sued a lot
and i'm sure that lawsuits will continue
and and
so you know we're appealing those cases
where we lost
uh we won some cases as well so
you know what i can assure you
is that any order we issue is done with
great consultation
with our legal team we have some very
good lawyers and
you know sometimes judges disagree with
what we do we understand that we respect
that
and we follow the process and the
process means that we can appeal
or don't and you know we we make those
decisions based upon what
you know uh best council advice is
and what we think is in the best
interest of the people the state of ohio
so we're not going to make any order
unless we feel that it is a valid order
sometimes a judge may disagree and
that's the way the system works
next question is from brian duggar at
wtol in toledo
hi governor you said that you're going
to assess
bars and restaurants in one week now we
know that hospitalizations will likely
to continue to go
up because they are a lagging indicator
so what numbers
are you going to be looking at and what
in your mind is acceptable progress
well you're right these things these
things lag
there's there's absolutely no doubt
about that
and frankly i had a choice i was giving
a speech to the people the state of ohio
i
want to be as transparent and as open as
possible i could have not
referenced bars last night
or or restaurants but i want to just set
it out before the people of the state
that this is something that we believe
we will have to go to
if things continue down the path that
they're going
you know we are seeing some spread in
bars
and restaurants what's unique about them
is that it's more difficult now
you know they've done a good job most
bars most restaurants have done a good
job
but they inherently they're inside
generally now this time of year
and there's many times people can't wear
a mask
and that's what inherently it's not
their fault but it makes it more
dangerous and more dicey quite frankly
so
as we look at this thing uh as i
said in my opening comments today we're
going to first talk
to our hospitals we talk to our
hospitals all the time
and we check with them to see what you
know what they are seeing
and how bad the situation is if you look
at today's numbers
i mean you know we are going we are
growing this this
is growing at a just a massive amount
and we're going to have to take the
actions that need to be taken
but the things we talked about yesterday
um individuals in their own lives
taking control of things is still the
most important thing that can be done
i can't order that but people can do
that
uh and that's where we're seeing
significant spread
retail outlets we put a mask
we order on in july and yet
unfortunately we have places in ohio
where you walk in and no one's wearing a
mask or very few people are that's not
fair to the employees and it's not fair
uh to the customers
and so we're gonna have to do what we
have to do
in regard to that again not in a
punitive way
uh we're gonna give warnings we're gonna
talk to people we're gonna try
to get them to to comply before doing
anything
anything punitive uh at all
where we've seen a lot of spread where
we've seen these big spread
events have been weddings and some
funerals
and so as i looked at things and we
looked at it and all the people i talked
to
both inside and outside the
administration said what are we going to
do
you know those are two specific things
that we came up with
that we believe will make a difference
weddings and funerals coming under under
not that they can't have the the event
the party
the coming together the wake whatever
we're not telling people they can't do
it we're just telling them they got to
do it in us
in a safe way we're saying to
retail outlets it just needs to be safe
we want you to stay open but where i am
convinced
that the flaring up this virus
i know it's not good for business and so
if we can assure people that they're
going to be safe
in a business that a retail outlet they
go to
they're more likely to go to that and
it's just in everybody
everybody's interest and the third thing
again we didn't say we were going to do
it
on a certain date we said we're going to
look at it we said look if
things don't change then in a week we
will have to do this
so that's that's what we said but we're
constantly monitoring this every day
and we'll take an answer to your
question it's a totality of all the
circumstances
it's not just one number or two numbers
we look at multiple numbers
and we look at exactly where we are
for those who say i don't like your
decisions last night or i don't like
your idea about bars and restaurants i
understand
i fully understand that you know we
don't want to close anything
nothing but the buck does stop with me
and i can tell you
and medical experts have told me and
hospitals told me
that at the rate we're going
this is not sustainable we're going to
have
very bad consequences when this
if this thing continues to go up at the
rate it's going
and just look at how much is it is
jumping
every single day so it's not a question
you know it's not an
option the governor doesn't have an
option to do something we have to take
action
it would be totally irresponsible at
this point
not to take actions
next question is from jack windsor at
wmfd in mansfield
hey jack hi governor in
communication with your ohio department
of health we were told
currently quote there are many fewer
non-coveted respiratory illnesses
than usual because of social distancing
mask wearing and working from home
so two-part question in light of the
newly commissioned retail compliance
unit
you spoke about last night if masked
masks work for flu and other respiratory
illnesses
why are they not working for covet and
then the second part of that is what
evidence are you getting to indicate
masking compliance levels the eyeball
test where i am shows that almost
everyone is masking and
has been well jack again i
i'm with all due respect i disagree with
your facts
um so we start from a different premise
i guess
masks are being used in some places and
at one level in some places in
a different level in other places
there's not
you know there's no uniformity
consistency i mean if i could wave a
wand and we were doing 90
mass compliance every place in public i
would say we got it
it's good but we're seeing an
inconsistency
why do i think mass work every expert
that has looked at this says they they
work
go look at look at article after article
but i'll tell you what our own
experience in ohio has been
when in july several of our mayors put a
mass order on
in their city and at the sa and
shortly after that i put a mask order on
for the rest of their county and
for any county that was read at the time
we saw a very quick increase
in mask usage uh now this is
look i mean this is this is eyeballing
it this is people out looking this is
what mayors are telling me this is what
um health commissioners are telling me
mass compliance went up dramatically at
the same time when mass compliance went
up cases went down
there was no other reason for those
cases to go down i mean there could have
been some other variable in there that
may have impacted some
but the biggest variable the biggest
change that we could see was
mass were being worn and so we saw the
cases go down
dramatically another example
while there are cases associated with
schools
when i talk to superintendents and when
i talk to health departments
they believe and we're doing some
studies right now this week and next
week and the week after and we'll have
much better day
data i'll tell you what they believe
what they believe is that there's not
much
transmission directly in the classroom
from one student to another
one student who has covet to another
student
why well they're inside that would
indicate there might be transmission
they're sitting there at least for an
hour sometimes for seven
hours why wouldn't we see it
the only thing we know of is because
everybody's wearing a mask
so these are just things that we know
from our own experience in ohio and i've
said this very
a lot of times when this thing started
you know
we didn't know a lot and there's still a
lot we don't know
but one thing that i think you know i'm
a
old prosecutor former prosecutor um
we used to say you know jury is back
on this issue on this issue on mask
the jury is back and the verdict is mass
work
and masks are needed next question is
from marty schlayton at the ohio capitol
journal
hey marty hi how are you governor
good um hopefully
uh vaccines will start coming online
maybe in january if we're really lucky
and i know you're thinking about
protecting uh
frontline healthcare workers which seems
totally appropriate
is there any thought toward pro uh
prioritizing uh
some lower income people both because
they're working the kinds of jobs where
they've got to go face the public and
retail
and also because they're living in
settings where it's more difficult
to uh socially distance
yes yes and we're still going through
that process i know the federal
government's still going through that
process
uh you know our our goal is marty is to
save the most lives we
can and to slow the virus down as
quickly as we can
so we've looked at at for example
somebody who works in a grocery store
they're exposed to people all day
they may have asthma
they may have be diabetic but they have
to work
and we have a lot of people who are in
that category so yeah as we put this
together and it's not finalized
as we put together this together that
certainly is a group of people
you know that we would like to be able
uh
to get help to through the vaccine
as early in the process as as as we can
next question is from john reed at
gangwar news service
good afternoon governor hi john uh with
uh
with this latest surge coming just as i
mean the coronavirus relief fund dollars
from the federal government are expiring
in the next
several weeks um how important is it
that congress
appropriates more money um considering
costs are probably going to go up
because of this now this is very
important
uh i talked to senator portman um
yesterday uh i intend to talk to senator
brown the next day or two
i've talked to members of the house of
representatives
um this is very important uh we need a
bill
uh we need a bill number one to allow us
to
uh take this money that we already have
over beyond december 31st not have to
spend it before december 31st
it would be an inefficient use of the
money for us to have to spend it now
um so being able to carry that over is
very important
uh having additional money um
is important as well so uh yeah
we it's very very very important
um you know we are grateful for the help
that congress has given us in the past
we do not have the ability uh
in ohio we have to balance our budget
every year
um that's a good thing but uh
you know there's no extra money there's
no no money to do some of these things
that we know
really really need to be done so we're
we're holding money back
we keep thinking there's probably going
to be a bill that we can
move that money over so we can do
testing into next year
because even though i'm very optimistic
of the news this
week we hope to have the first batch of
vaccine in
in december but we know it's going to
take a while
uh for that to go out and all during
that period of time we're going to
continue to wear mass we're going to
continue to keep the distance we're
going to do all the things that were
you know we're doing now and we're going
to have to continue to test
and you know we need money for that
testing
next question is from jim otte at
w-h-i-o in dayton
hey jim hey governor let's talk about
the mechanics of the modified mask
order uh first off has that come out yet
secondly
how do you envision this working your
staff from the bureau of workers
compensation will be will they be
going into stores or will this be on a
complaint basis do you have enough
people
to realistically enforce this across the
state
well first of all jim what we hope
is with this order that
and with the great increase in cases
that people are seeing i mean this is a
different ballgame today
this is a different world than we had in
the spring this is a different world
than we had
in the summer ohio faces a much bigger
challenge today
and i think that people it's time now
for people to reassess
and if someone said look i'm not gonna
wear a mask now's the time to think
you know i really need to do this so
what we hope is with the new order
with the enforcement uh threat out there
frankly
uh that people will comply a lot more
and i think they will
specifically in regard to your question
you know the bureau of workers
compensation
exists to protect workers
what these agents will be doing when
they go out is protecting workers
we want to ensure that every ohio worker
when they go to work
they're in a retail establishment
they're faced
they're looking at people who are
wearing a mask also
and not be in a situation where all the
employees are wearing masks
but yet people coming in and customers
don't have to that's not fair
it's not fair it's not right so what
these inspectors will do
is they will they will be going out they
will be going into stores
they will be assessing the situation
they will be meeting with the store
manager who's ever in charge on that
shift
and kind of talking about you know what
is going on these stores
you know we need for the stores to
continue to make sure that there's not a
whole bunch of people
in the store they have to manage that
at the same time they have an obligation
to see
that it's a safe working environment
just like anything else
and wearing a mask is part of that safe
environment
we anticipate they're there to help
uh and to explain and you know the
first time they come in that store
they're not gonna shut anything down
they might they may depending on the
facts give a warning
if they when they come back if still the
situation is not good then you know they
can take uh
their discretion um appropriate action
to
you know shut the store down until the
store you know up to 24 hours
doesn't mean it always has to be that
but until that store
can comply and there's a safe
environment
public has a right to have a safe
environment employees have a right to
have a safe environment
that's how we intend to intend to do it
next question is from alex ebert at
bloomberg
hey governor thanks for this opportunity
i have the the blessing and the pleasure
to cover the midwest for bloomberg
and in doing that i get to see how the
governors
try to needle their way between
conservatives that are
worried about overreach of the
government and liberals that are more
concerned about
um you know not doing things for the
equity of
poor people in the states in terms of
covet how do you personally
go about making these decisions trying
to get political consensus behind these
things
and what are your considerations about
trying to keep
the political will behind the things
that you're doing because you're
a little bit out of step and ahead of
michigan kentucky and indiana
um in your your new mass mandate thank
you
well it's interesting um as you know
from your coverage of the midwest
governors
um sometimes one's been ahead sometime
another
we talk a lot in fact we have a call
today i'm looking forward to that call
um you know we're all facing the same
issue uh in the past
some of our states have been hotter than
others now
every midwest state is facing a problem
no one's
no one's got a break now and so we
continue to
compare notes uh and have discussions
about what
what we think will work you know i've
said this before but
what i think about all day is what else
should we be doing what else could we be
doing
um you know how do we
bring people along in this discussion
because it's a you know when a tornado
hits
we see it we see the damage we all know
that we
need to go deal with it uh
you know ohio river uh
overflows and floods down in southern
ohio and lawrence county or
some county you know we know what's
going on this virus
you know it's it's quiet
uh it's secretive we just see the
casualties
and so it's it's tougher for people to
comprehend
and i think what is difficult now is for
people to comprehend
how much different this is than it was
in the spring how much different this is
than it was in the summer it's not even
close
and so how i communicate that um
you know is something i struggle with i
think about
one thing that we've been doing and i
think it was sometimes misunderstood and
that's probably because i didn't explain
it very well
but john houston and i now have had i
think 25 calls with 25 different county
leaders and what we've tried to do
uh is get these leaders not to take my
job over
or for me to duck any responsibility
that's not what we're asking them to do
what we're asking them to do is to help
explain to the people in their county
exactly what's going on in their county
and really what they need to do
and we've had great calls i think it's
been very successful
and it's been a frank exchange of ideas
in some cases
it's been things that they needed us to
do and
we're trying to do those things in other
cases it was frankly
us explaining to them exactly what is
going on
you know what the numbers do show and
not everybody
everybody's got a busy life not everyone
knows exactly what's going on
and so it's bringing people together in
counties is
one way to get back to your question one
way that we try to bring people along
because ultimately you know
i work for the people of the state of
ohio
but i owe them a frank discussion
we tried to have that frank discussion
um
last night we're carrying on those
discussions as we talk to leaders and
these zoom calls
all over the state and i appreciate very
much i want to say this to all of them
the local officials
whether we've got you on the zoom yet
call or not but we appreciate everything
that you're doing
because you're really a key to
you know having the public understand
and then carrying out what we
need to do at the county level
next question is from kenny bass at wchs
in charleston west virginia
hi governor thanks for the opportunity
since closing bars and restaurants in
ohio has thrown the table as a
possibility
can you share the scientific data and
contact tracing that confirms spread
is a real problem in those
establishments and would drive your
decision
and since you regularly share problems
with us about weddings
funerals and churches as major sources
of outbreaks
are you considering shutting those
things down in order to contain the
spread and finally
if small gatherings of family and
friends are major sources of spread
which you've said why not some type of
order limiting those activities and
try your luck in court and see what
happens thank you
well you know we do have still an order
on uh
of 10 people gathering together there's
some exceptions but
that order has never gone off um
you know i don't intend to send agents
out to knock on people's doors
uh go into their backyard go down to
their rec room i mean you know we can't
we can't do that and we shouldn't do
that so a lot of
going back to you know previous alex's
question
um previous question a lot of it is
persuasion a lot of it is
letting people understand what the facts
are and so that they can
make those those decisions
so you know some of this we can't do and
shouldn't do
uh by any kind of mandate but
uh you know as far as the
weddings uh in these events look
we're not gonna tell someone you can't
get married i'm not gonna tell someone
they can't bury their loved one or can't
have a ceremony not gonna do that
not gonna do that not right not right
but
we can say look we're losing people
people are dying as a result of some of
these celebrations
and we've had horrible stories
just breaks your heart and so telling
people yeah you can do it
but you know wear a mask stay at the
table just like you would
at a restaurant don't go dance
don't mingle uh you know i know that's
tough it goes against kind of our grain
particularly as
a celeb celebration but there's other
ways of of doing these things you can
have
the event if you want to have a big
party you know when this thing is over
have a great big party
there's just there's many alternatives
many ways that people
people can can deal with with that as
far as the evidence
from bars look i i looked at some things
today reports
we've got evidence there's spread in
bars there is there is spread in
in restaurants is there spread other
places absolutely we got spread
all over the place and
i think i've talked a lot about the
weddings and funerals and we're doing
something about
that i think i've talked a lot about
people coming together
in just in informal ways and how
dangerous
that is in that case there's no rule we
can issue or should
people we just have to warn people these
are very dangerous situations be careful
particularly for the next two or two to
two or three months
but yeah we've got we've got examples of
spread that's occurred
and again as i said at the beginning
when you try to
analyze this and say okay what can we do
to slow this down
and when we know that masks are so very
very important
your attention is naturally drawn to the
places where you can't wear a mask
think of a bar music is up
and you know people are drinking they're
sitting at the table
but uh you know they're not wearing a
mask
uh and they're there for some period of
time same way
sometimes with restaurants so if you
just try to
logically analyze this we're not trying
to pick on bars and restaurants
you know i've had members of my family
who've been involved owning bars and
owning restaurants
and you know these these things are
the last thing we want to do small
business we love small business my
family's been in small businesses
you know but we have to analyze it
from a logical approach
and we haven't said we're going to
definitely do this
but what i wanted to do i owed it
the people of the state people run bars
people who run restaurants to say look
we're looking at this
and we're concerned about john yeah
governor i
i want to just add to this that you know
hopefully the message that you're
hearing from us is that
we're trying to give people every single
tool we can
to help them help us make sure we keep
things open
but we also can't be tone deaf to the
to the hospitals who we talk to who who
tell us
that their staffs are stressed that
some already have pulled back on
elective surgeries
and and not you know fully prepare the
people of ohio
for that reality too so what we're
asking
is just do things the right way
use those masks try to avoid events
if you can avoid them pull back on these
things a little while
until we get this back under control so
that we don't
have to get ourselves to a point that we
we have to shut anything down
because we don't want to but we we have
to recognize the reality of what our
our health care professionals are facing
and the implications to people's health
and livelihoods and
and try to find that balance and
hopefully we're communicating that
that's why we give you the data
that's why we we try this is a
communications exercise getting
information because
my experiences is that if everybody has
the same information they'll usually
come to the same conclusion
and we hope that this information will
help people understand
the pressures that people in the
healthcare system are going through
right now and
and how we all have to try to help each
other out
next question is from dan derose at woio
in cleveland governor and lieutenant
governor
thanks for the opportunity i don't want
to take too much more time on bars and
restaurants i do just want to say that
i'd been contacted almost immediately
after your your
your news conference yesterday from
restaurant owners namely uh
one in a small restaurant in east canton
who said if they go through a shutdown
again that that'll be it
that they'll never be able to reopen
again i do want to talk about doses you
were on
cbs this morning uh in a live interview
and you talked about
uh it was the first time you've put a
number on what you think
our first delivery of a vaccine will be
you said 30
000 uh pfizer that's a double dose so
that that really knocks it down to 15
000 people will be the first to get
the doses when it comes to ohio and you
said it would be spent
on our nursing home staff 15 000
out of 11.7 million people but yet you
keep telling us to have hope
15 000 versus 11.7 million
doesn't sound like a lot of hope uh
dan there's hope out there
there's a vaccine apparently uh that has
been developed
that was 90 percent uh worked
uh and that's that's very very good news
um here's what we've been told
we've been told that the third first
batch will be thirty thousand
um because we believe other batches will
be right behind that
that really is thirty thousand uh we
assume the second
shot will come right behind that now
again
this is it's a work in progress and
we're just
we're just relaying i'm just relaying to
you what the federal government is
relaying to us
but we hope that this comes
very quickly in batches right after that
so these batches
some of this the federal government is
going to send directly to places in ohio
some of that we believe is going to come
to us and we will make sure it is
it is distributed so i can't tell you
how fast this will come out
um i'm hearing the same things that
you're hearing uh
you know dr fauci was on this morning he
was talking about spring
uh when you know we would have a
significant distribution
i've also heard july as far as
significant
distribution i don't know but i do know
it's coming
and i do know or at least feel that it's
going to be a lot of it coming our way
just as it is in every
every other state so that is the hope
that is out there
and i think we have to have hope i think
it's realistic hope
i try to be real realistic throughout
this but i've also
as i indicated last night we have a long
winter ahead of us
and this is the time for us to take that
deep breath and say hey we can make it
to the finish of this marathon
we can do it we've come a long way we've
sacrificed
a lot now is not the time to lose the
opportunity
to make it uh and and to be able to
celebrate
uh you know let's let's hope maybe a
world series in
cleveland or world series in cincinnati
and you know whatever you
love to do uh or just being with your
kids and your grandkids
you know we all have a lot to live for
let's get through this and here's what
we got to do to do it because this virus
is threatening us
and we are tougher than the virus and we
just need to push back
and we know we have the tools in our
hands
to fight back and we we can do that so i
don't think it's false hope
it's hope it's realistic hope
next question is from jackie borchardt
at the cincinnati enquirer
good afternoon governor um experts have
told me that it will take longer than
one week for this to tamp down
even if everyone were to just right now
at this moment
do 100 of the things that you've been
asking them to do
so should ohioans take your one-week
warning as a one-week notice that
businesses will start to close next week
how much notice do you plan to give
businesses and what financial aid will
be available if there are closures
jackie thank you for the question um
look we're facing a
monumental crisis in this state
and i'll say it again you know
this is not would not be a decision that
i would make lightly but we have to do
some things to slow this down so if we
can get masked wearing up
this week if we can see things move in
our direction
yes we can we can postpone that and we
may never have to do it
but we've got to see movement we've got
to see
something that indicates that we can
slow this thing down
because doing the same thing time after
time
is not going to slow it down and unlike
the spring
spring we things were shut down we
flattened the curve
we got back up we opened things up we
moved forward in the summer
we put masks on that's what knocked it
down in the summer
now everybody's tired i understand i'm
tired everybody's sick of it
but we got to get back up one more time
and we got to be able to do it
and so if we can start making some
progress
in that direction then yes we don't want
to close anything down
and run for governor to close stuff down
that's not what we want to do
but we're going to do what we have to do
and
what i'm asking the people of ohio to do
put your mask on stay
be careful don't go to that party
these are things that we can do now and
we will see pretty quick results
we can do that
next question is from joe ingles at ohio
public radio and television
good afternoon governor hi
we've been hearing cases of people who
live with someone who's covet positive
they're supposed to be quarantining um
but they're not because they don't feel
sick they're not showing symptoms they
don't have paid sick leave
fear of losing their job and they
believe the pandemic is politically
motivated
they continue to go to work sometimes in
places like hospitals and nursing homes
where people could easily get this what
can be done
to make sure those who should be
quarantining due to exposure
exposure are actually doing it yeah joe
quarantines are done at the local level
they're done by 113 health departments
i mean i think my job our job is to
continue to try to appeal to them
and continue to
you know message to them i mean i know
that the last thing anyone wants to do
is to hurt someone else or to kill
someone else and certainly they don't
want to do that to
someone they know or someone even they
don't know so i think
bringing home the reality of how how
this spreads is just very very important
and i think we all have
all of us have an obligation to do that
i've asked the mayors to do it i'll ask
the county commissioners to do it
but this is this is a persuasion
you know part of what this is is
bringing people along and letting them
understand the gravity of the situation
that we're in today
that's what i'm trying to do next
question is from kevin landers at wbns
in columbus
hello governor kevin thank you for
taking it uh
for doing this again um mass and stay at
home orders have been
seems the most effective ways to reduce
the spread and if cases are skyrocketing
and hospitals are stressed out
why not take that drastic measure and do
another stay-at-home order if we're at
such dire straits now and
do you believe that the state has an
obligation to pay back revenues for
those businesses who may have to close
as a result
thank you
well i'll leave that up to the lawyers
um second part of the question
uh let me talk take the first one i saw
a headline
today i always look at the front pages
of all the major newspapers in the state
and
i know the writers have told me that
they don't write the headlines and
sometimes
headline writers have to squeeze stuff
in but uh there's one talking about
shutdown
we're not talking about a shutdown we're
not talking about shutting down
the state what we're talking about
is is is trying to
do what we have to do so our hospitals
can stay open
so our kids can stay in school
grandparents who are in nursing homes or
great grandparents or in those
nursing homes can be safe that's what
that's what frankly this is
this is all about but we're not
looking to shut down and the reason
we're not looking to shut down is we
know the cost
i don't just mean economic cost i mean
the personal human cost
that goes with a shutdown
mental health problems have gone up
significantly since this virus hit
um we've lost more people to drug
overdoses
because people are alone uh one theory
is that they're more alone and if they
overdose there's no one there to help
them there's no
one there to call 9-1-1 there's no one
there to help
we know with a shutdown kids who are in
school
who need to be in school can't be in
school
we know that when we had the previous
shutdown uh
that we had fewer cases of child abuse
reported
i don't think there was less child abuse
i think there just weren't teachers to
look at these kids
and make a determination there might be
child abuse and reported to the local
children's services so
tremendous penalty tremendous damage
is done when there's a shutdown
you know we may come to that i suppose
but that is not what we want to do
and particularly when we have it within
our own power
to avoid that so i guess if there's one
message from today
i would like to leave with everyone we
have it within our own power
to avoid these bad consequences either
of a shutdown
or of this virus is running wild
through the state of ohio we can control
it by what
each one of us does next question is
from jeff redick at wsyx
in columbus
chef you on there
sorry can you hear me now uh got you now
we got you thank you
uh good afternoon t i know it probably
feels sometimes like you don't have a
lot of
allies in this process um the ohio
restaurant association today said any
discussion
another restaurant closure would be
inconsistent with any science or contact
tracing data
that we have been provided that's a
quote from their release and
earlier you said that you've seen data
about bar and restaurant spread
and contact tracing but we haven't seen
that will you commit to release that
to not only the restaurants but to the
public so it can be evaluated by people
well we're going to tell you what we see
yeah i mean we're happy to tell you what
we see
as i've talked about a number of times
on this press conference before
the data is collected at the local level
and it is not set up in a way that you
can come up with mathematical
precision but we do know
the power of masks we know that
in bars and restaurants you cannot
wear a mask at certain points certainly
when you're eating certainly when you're
drinking
so we we know those for facts i looked
just looked at some reports
and there were cases in there that came
they felt came from restaurants
what you have many many times and came
from bars
i i think what you you need to
understand the public needs to
understand
is that it is so widespread today
that many times someone is at five or
six
different places and they can't they
can't really trace it down to one place
so
you know that that is something that is
it's just a is a fact
but do we have indication that
it's spread sure uh it's not the only
place it spreads it spreads other places
too
but certainly it spreads in restaurants
and it's going to spread more
as people get more inside
i could just i just want to add that
look we've been doing weekly phone calls
with the restaurant association
i will be in a conversation with them
this afternoon we have we are working
with them
to find every collaborative way that we
can to reduce the spread of the virus
to just take a collaborative
constructive approach with them so
we will continue to listen to the
restaurant owners and the bars and
and get the best information and try to
get on the same page with the data
that we are both looking at as we work
through this process
next question is from ben schwartz at
wcpo in cincinnati
hi governor um
i have an email here from a wcpo viewer
who says they see police officers not
wearing masks
in areas where everyone else is required
to they've asked these officers why they
aren't
to which they reply they don't have to
wear one while on duty
in this viewer's words they quote remain
concerned that these law enforcement
officers choices are posing a danger to
the public
they say they've reached out to your
office about this with no response
so i'm just wondering if you're able to
address these concerns
uh we'll take a look at that i mean you
know my first reaction
to that is that that is a matter that uh
was within the jurisdiction of that
police department there may be a
legitimate reason
why they're not wearing masks but we'll
look at it
we'll look at it next question is from
matt
wright at wjw in cleveland
hey matt you i missed your first you
just came on
missed the first few words okay thank
you just again on the contact tracing
you
have said previously that local health
officials have been reporting that
contact tracing shows coven 19
largely spreading at private gatherings
of family and friends
and not at bars and restaurants so has
that changed what new evidence are you
basing your closure decision on
okay i don't think i ever said that
it was not spreading at bars and
restaurants
what i've said is i tried to communicate
to people in ohio
that we have a problem and the problem
lies within their own hands
uh and that there is spread that's
occurring
inadvertently obviously when people with
friends
people with family people who are when
they're with
others uh that they're close to um
they let their guard down and so i've
i've kind of gone out of my way to try
to make
that point but
to to inform people that they can
control a lot of this
but we have spread a number of places
but when you look at a bar and you look
at a restaurant there is a reason
that other states i mean we are not
alone
in talking about closing bars and
restaurants there is a reason
that other states have gone and closed
bars and restaurants or
or curtailed them other states by the
way have been more prohibitive in regard
to
how many people can be in a restaurant
all we've done is said a distance
most state many states have gone to 25
some have gone to 50
so we've tried throughout this to to
balance this
and understanding the great needs that
bars and restaurants have
uh and the people who work there and the
owners
people run the places we we understand
there's a lot at stake here and we
understand also they've been hit very
hard
and that the pandemic itself has slowed
down the number of people who who want
to go out
but you know we've never said that
there's not
there's not spread at bars and
restaurants
next question is from randy ludlow at
the columbus dispatch
hey randy
good afternoon governor um
given the the rate at which cases
have risen uh we went and only took a
week to go from 4 000 cases to 6 000.
now it's taken two days to go to seven
thousand
uh given how swiftly this is growing is
it wise to tell ohio that there will not
be any more widespread
shutdowns or stay at home order
randy if i said that uh i didn't mean to
say it
like that let me let me kind of state it
the way i think
from what i'm seeing we don't want to
have a shutdown
we want to avoid a shutdown we can avoid
a shutdown
and the way we can avoid a shutdown is
if all of us
are very careful we can do most of the
things that we've always done but we
cannot do them the same way
we have to do them differently we have
to do them wearing a mask
we have to do them with some distance
so it's not that it's not a never
but it is this is within our control
we don't have to let it get that bad
we don't have to let it get to the point
where our hospitals are stacked up
we don't have to get let's get to the
point where
hospitals can't do other types of
surgeries
these are things we can avoid we have it
within our power to do
and i think we need to try that before
we get to the point the
absolute drastic nuclear
bomb of of you know shutting down again
uh we don't we really don't want to shut
down again
but do i rule that out no i can't rule
anything out
you know we have to base decisions every
day on what
kind of facts that we are seeing but
you're absolutely right randy this thing
is rolling through
ohio uh really fast
next question is from scott hallas at
the xenia daily gazette
hey scott hey governor how are you i'm
well sir
good thank you for uh taking our
questions uh
after uh last night's um speech to the
uh to the state
i had gotten a couple emails from a
couple of gym owners and even a couple
of
people who run dance studios who i know
and they want to know and maybe the
order will contain all this but
when you say employees and customers
have to be wearing masks
are there still going to be exemptions
for people who are in a gym while
they're actively working out that they
don't have to wear a mask
or if someone's teaching a dance class
to you know eight or nine people
while they're actively doing that you
know are they going to be exempt from
having to wear a mask or is this going
to be a
100 you know mask all the time type of
order
well our mask order uh enforcement side
and
the additions that we just added to it
uh really are focused on retail outlets
uh more than dance studios
or more than uh fitness centers
uh so you know it's at least for the
time being
uh the current order in regard to
fitness centers and dance studios
remains at this point so there's not
there's not really a change the only
thing i would ask is just people be
careful if you can wear a mask in those
situations
you know that is obviously a lot safer
but
you know when we talked about what we
might have to do in the future with bars
and restaurants
on fitness centers a lot does a lot of
that is
based upon the fact that people are not
wearing masks
so for now in answer to your
folks question it's the same
next question is from tanisha johnson at
spectrum news
i think we lost tunisia we'll move on to
uh eric halperin of wcmh in columbus
go ahead somebody if i may governor
um thank you for taking my question um
with cases rising
and as you've noted um it being on a
massive level and hospitals trying to
manage
capacity how close do you feel we are
have you heard in terms of having to use
any sort of overflow space that was
initially set up in the beginning for
patients
um are we anywhere near that and then in
any conversations that you've had
how might that now be managed since um
health care workers are already
exhausted
yeah it's a good point i mean as we
talked about last night
the exhaustion of the health care
workers and
the fact that this is now hitting
throughout the midwest throughout the
northern part
of the country and in every county in
ohio
makes it very different than it was in
the spring and in the summer
so the besides just the number of
hospitalizations
going up dramatically uh it's that it's
everywhere so there's no place where we
can turn and say hey
because some of the nurses from this
part of the state come over to this part
we can't do that um so this is managed
and managed very well
uh by by our hospitals we set up the
three zones
early on um you know they did a very
good job
in conjunction many times with the the
um
ohio national guard in having the build
out
or the proposed bill that built out of
the plans for the build-out so they're
ready to go
out but you know what you're going to
see
first the first warning sign we have
started to see when the cleveland clinic
made the decision
to pull back for a few days at least on
some
elective surgery surgeries where someone
had to spend the night
and the reason they had that line is
because
it's the bed it's a precious bed
and so you know those will be that's the
early warning sign
and then these hospitals and we'll keep
you informed and the hospitals will keep
you informed as we move forward
about exactly what stage that we're at
but
but you're right it's it's the people
the people we really
worry about they're tired uh they're our
heroes
and there's only how much more can we
ask of them
next question is from eric halpern at
wcmh in columbus
governor good afternoon thanks for
taking the time today um going back
to retail and this uh reissuing of the
order i know you say this is to protect
both the employees and the customers
i was talking to the franklin county
chamber of commerce today and they say
that you know both between their members
employees and customers they're seeing
95 percent
compliance i know that's just franklin
county in central ohio
but if they're seeing that high of
compliance where are the issues that
you're seeing
now well not everybody's at 95.
um you know it's a big state it's a
diverse state
people have different attitudes cultures
of looking at things
and so if it was 95 percent we wouldn't
be talking about it
if it was 95 across the state of ohio i
would not be talking about it
it's not 95 across the state i wish it
was
uh it's very inconsistent and what we're
trying to do is just get get it up in
the neighborhood of 95
you know what we're trying to do
governor next question is the last
question for today and it belongs to
jess hardin of mahoningmatters.com
hello hi governor um as you're aware
mahoning matters is currently in
mediation with odh
over zip code data for the mahoning
valley
our public record requests first filed
in may were
ignored and then rejected if more people
had had this information
six months ago to make better decisions
could that have mitigated the surge
and if your answer is no why release it
now saying you want to give
the most information when we can uh jess
i don't know um look i'll i'll look at
that
myself i'm i'm not aware of that so i
apologize but i'll get back to you and
our team will get back to you
um i don't i don't really know
oh well we have uh
i'm sure good news for everyone uh fran
is here to tell us some good news about
the ohio imagination library and uh
a milestone that they were able to reach
in the last
last few days fran
thank you it's good to be here
especially with
a little good news i'm so pleased to
announce that the ohio governor's
imagination library
is now as of this week statewide
which means that every child from the
time they're born until they turn five
years old
is eligible to receive a book in the
mail every single month
no matter what county they live in you
know we partner with the dolly parton
imagination library and when we started
there was only a handful of
counties that offered the books and
about
13 of our eligible kids were getting
them
but today all 88 counties are eligible
and we have about 34 percent of the kids
that are getting the free books each
month
we have a little video
it's hard to believe the ohio governor's
imagination library program is a year
old when we began the program
partnering with dolly parton imagination
library last summer
the program was available in pockets of
ohio
in certain zip codes in certain cities
but mike and i believe that every ohio
child under the age of five should
benefit from getting these free
imagination library books in the mail
every single month
as grandparents we've seen our grandkids
excitement
receiving the imagination library books
in greene county
so over the past year one by one we
worked on partnerships to add more
counties
i've really enjoyed meeting with our
county partners and
parents my name is payton tolbert and my
name is wendell tolbert
so every day we read at morning and at
night
so we brought a special book the rainbow
she loved getting things in the mail she
loved reading it we would instantly sit
down and have to read every single time
so for us my imagination library
experience through my daughter
has been incredible and absolutely a
treasure in our lives
and i like the variety of the books that
the imagination library sends
they may be books that either weren't on
my radar or books that i may not have
chosen for them myself
and then to watch them become some of
our kids favorite books
is really fun to watch
it's definitely a privilege to be a
partner with ohio governor's imagination
library what i really
really appreciate about the books that
he's received
is um really just the diversity
that you see and very coincidentally
just today we
um just got this book the ring bearer so
um we haven't even read it yet but i'm
really excited about that and i was
really excited
to see uh you know kids
of color on that cover they've helped us
to connect as a family and learn more
about
things around us like baking this is one
of our favorite books
and about numbers and about forest
animals
all different kinds of trucks and trains
which one did you pick oh the little
engine that could we got that from the
imagination library
our goal for the ohio governor's
imagination library in giaga county is
to get as many families and community
leaders involved as possible
we want to inspire a love of learning
when we encourage kids to read for
pleasure they become lifelong learners
and that's ultimately what we want for
our community
why do you like to read before bed god
is so
fun because it's so fun our local
communities are just
kind of coming together and figuring out
ways
to put these books in children's hand
and
all seven of our counties are in
appalachia and as we build stronger
communities we're building a stronger
ohio
kids who read succeed
success is what we're bringing reading
is an instrument
but it's success we're bringing to your
county success we're bringing
to your economy it's success that we're
bringing to all of ohio together
it's also about their imagination so to
see them take what they've read
and then later play using some of the
characters
or the lessons in the story i think
those are all things that go just beyond
reading for the sake of getting from a
beginning of a book to an end
also i really like the snuggles that
come along with story time
to the imagination library thank you for
creating this program
we truly appreciate finding ways to
connect with our children
and also increasing literacy in the home
so
bye bye guys and i really like this one
oh yeah and that's your that says
kindergarten here i come
because you're starting what
thank you thank you bye bye
thank you
we've been able to put more books in the
hands of ohio's children during these
very
very challenging times thanks to the
support of the general assembly
and also to our partners statewide
to sign up please visit ohio
imaginationlibrary.org
actually just today our little
four-day-old granddaughter meg was
signed up for the imagination library so
