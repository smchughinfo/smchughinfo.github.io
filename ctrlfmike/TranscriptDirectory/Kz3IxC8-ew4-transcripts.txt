afternoon everyone
it's a beautiful day i want to take a
moment to
talk about the president's diagnosis
with cobot first we continue to pray for
his
recovery recovery the first lady
and we pray for the recovery of all the
people in this
country and around the world who have
the virus
we also pray for
families of those who have lost someone
to the virus the president
said yesterday that we should not let
the virus dominate
dominate our life and that certainly is
is true
uh we have to learn to live with it
at least for a while now part of that
means accepting
that is in every community in ohio and
that all of us are at risk
of getting it part of that also means
taking the necessary precautionary
measures we all need to take
to help keep our economy open
keep it open and to keep our kids in
school
to be able to visit our loved ones and
nursing homes
and to do all the things that we want to
do
and to bring some sense of normalcy back
to our lives and we can do all these
things
that of course means wearing masks
keeping our distance washing our hands
avoiding large gatherings
it means taking this virus seriously
and respecting this enemy
knowing that it poses a great risk to
our ability to keep ohio safe
keep ohio open
it certainly though does not mean that
we have to be afraid
it does however mean that we have to be
realistic
and practical about it
over the last few days we've seen
commentators
raise a number of points and questions
about the president's
president's illness should the president
have left walter reed and gone back to
the white house
other people have raised questions why
did he leave at the time that he did
um should the white house be
contact tracy should the president have
taken his mask off
on the white house balcony yesterday
when he turned to
salute these questions go on
and on if you watched any tv yesterday
or the day before these are the
some of the questions that you we
continue to see and look people can
continue to talk about that and that's
that's fine
but for all of us in ohio my fellow
citizens
i think we need to keep focused um
ohioans should ask what are the enduring
lessons that we have learned from the
president and first lady's
illness what r
what lessons what lessons
are relevant to each of us
i have a few i'm sure each one of us can
come up with some
one even the leader
of our great country can get the virus
it can happen to anyone no one
is immune second
while testing can be and is
very important even very
frequent testing cannot substitute
for mask and social distancing
they have to go together number three
mask
do matter just number four distance
matters
number five contact tracing matters
as i said we can all come up with our
list but it seems to me that those are
things that
all of us can take away from the
president's
illness
in the days ahead let us talk and focus
on the things
that you and i can actually do
that we can actually impact the things
that we can do
to fight back against the virus the
things that we can do
to enable us to have more freedom to
enable us
to live a more normal life
each of us can demonstrate our love
and our respect for our fellow ohioans
by wearing a mask by avoiding large
gatherings of people
by frequently washing our hands and by
keeping at least six feet distance
from others all these things are within
our control this virus
is the enemy of our freedom
and by doing these things to fight back
against it
we will keep our kids in school we'll
keep them playing sports
we'll keep our economy moving forward
and all of this together
working together all of us will allow us
to live with this virus
until the time when it is gone
these are the things that must be our
focus
these are things that will remain my
focus
today i'm wearing a pink tie to
acknowledge october is breast cancer
awareness month
one in nine women will develop breast
cancer
making the disease the second leading
cause of cancer death among women
in ohio more than 9 800 cases of breast
cancer are diagnosed in women each year
accounting for nearly 30 percent of all
cancers in women
there is good news in ohio the female
breast cancer mortality rate has dropped
11 percent
in 10 years the survival rate among ohio
women diagnosed with
early stage breast cancer is nearly a
hundred percent
early detection is very critical
it is recommended that average risk
women ages 50 to 74 receive a
mammogram every two years that's
something obviously everyone should
consult their own
doctor ohio's breast and cervical cancer
project
assist women in finding screening
providers and other resources
and guiding them through the health care
process
the program all also offers no-cost
screenings
and diagnostic testing diagnostic
testing to those
who qualify for help or information call
1-844-430-2227
or search for bccp
and odh.ohio.gov and again that
the phone number 1-844-430-2227
we talk about our teachers a lot
because they're doing some just amazing
work
out there every single day in ohio
they're teaching through a pandemic
doing something that no ohio teachers
had to do for a hundred years
um yesterday was world teacher day and i
want to take a moment to
thank all of ohio's teachers this past
year has certainly
been a struggle whether it's juggling
distance education
hybrid or in-person teaching helping
students manage
their feelings their mental health
challenges that they might face or
working with families to help
kids succeed we thank our teachers for
the dedication
we invited today ohio's teacher of the
year
anthony coy gonzalez
a fourth and fifth grade teacher at the
ohio school for the deaf
we've asked him to join us today
superintendent of the school says
anthony has an amazing ability
an amazing ability to connect with
students anthony thank you very much for
joining us
today
good afternoon governor dewine and thank
you very much for inviting me here this
afternoon
my name is anthony coy gonzalez and i am
a teacher at the ohio school for the
deaf
as we have a certified deaf interpreter
with us today i will let her take over
in native asl
and i will use my voice thank you for
providing this access for our deaf
community
and i also want to thank you on behalf
of my students for recognizing their
hard work last year
in one of your press conferences
anthony congratulations um
teacher of the year uh we all
congratulate you for you good afternoon
governor dewine
to young people um tell us a little bit
about what school looks like
for your students this year
so our school has changed uh quite
drastically over the last seven months
and uh it's been a challenge for
for all of us but it's also been an
opportunity to learn
um and we've been quite resilient we've
seen
students teachers staff and families all
pitch in to reimagine what school can
look like
so this year we have a schedule that's
been
updated that allows us to have more time
with our students every day reading
writing math
social studies and science we also have
opportunities to meet one-on-one with
our students to help them through their
special education plans and provide that
really valuable time
but it is quite different we've had to
deliver meals we've been out there
delivering classroom materials to help
our students succeed
but it is uh it is a unique unique
opportunity for us
so anthony are you are you 100 i may
have missed it but you 100
uh virtual or or you have some in
in class or how does that work so
currently
we are virtual uh fully virtual
but we are looking forward to opening
our school back up later this month
to host some of the students who are
ready to return
and we're also preparing to continue
that virtual instruction for families
who choose to do so
for the the second quarter and and what
might be unique challenges that you're
facing now with with with your students
um any besides something that maybe
um another teacher might be facing
what what's unique so our students
um that we the students that we serve
are
in our school use american sign language
as their primary language and so we are
using uh technology that we received
last year thankfully
right in time in march to access that
communication
and be able to provide that direct
instruction to students
through the online learning we also
are looking to using masks when we
return and that's going to be an
additional barrier that we are working
through
our school is preparing virtual lessons
online
uh also providing individual pdpe
for our staff that might have clear
masks
where you will have that visible window
and with that window that will
provide that additional access to
american sign language
and so um in in that classroom
uh explain to me how this works
you were you were signing for us at the
beginning
and so somebody in your classroom is
that how they're getting your
course generally from you yes so
typically every day i will be using sign
language um without the use of my voice
in class
and that will be our primary mode of
instruction
throughout the day one of the one of the
challenges
of being completely virtual since the
pandemic has been
not having those students that we've
missed all this time
but also those students uh missing
school and their teachers and having
that
regular communication in our school for
their their access to language
throughout the day
so i imagine you and the students are
looking forward to kind of getting back
together in class absolutely absolutely
um i had the opportunity and i know a
lot of
ohio's teachers had the opportunity to
drop off some supplies to their students
over the summer and that was magic
we miss them so much and we can't wait
for them to be back
we we've seen some of those social
emotional needs
and being able to connect with them in
person from a safe distance with masks
you know has has been a beautiful
opportunity and we're really looking
forward to
continuing to provide that once we get
back into into the building
anthony one last question can you can
you uh
admire teachers very much and admire you
um
how did you become a teacher what what
inspired you to do that what was your
pathway sure um i think
my story is probably this very similar
to a lot of teachers out there
just having a heart for kids and wanting
to make a difference and
i think uh we're in an opportunity right
now where we can definitely do so
um i attended flagler college in st
augustine florida
after graduating from hillyard city
schools
and took sign language courses and
pursued it and returned home to ohio
where
i'm able to give back to the community
like a lot of teachers out there
i'm really proud to to serve with all of
ohio's teachers
so how many years you've been teaching
now seven years
seven years well thank you and we're
glad you're in ohio
and uh i know you'll be happy and your
students will be happy to see you and
get back into the
into the classroom but thank you very
very much and again congratulations uh
there's so many good teachers out there
and you're kind of the symbol
of all of those teachers who are making
a difference uh every single day anthony
thank you
i appreciate it thank you thank you very
much eric let's go and look at the
slides um we'll start off with our
general
slide unfortunately at 1
335 new cases is what we're reporting
um you know this is this is trending
upward we're now
um you can kind of see the trend of the
last 21 days
we're over now a thousand uh there was a
time
not too long ago when we were dipping
below a thousand we're over a thousand
now
uh so we are concerned uh about
about that uh let's go to the next slide
eric which is really a kind of a new
slide
it's based on this same information that
you have seen
before but i thought it might be
interesting we really have two things
that we look at every week
and on thursday we'll announce the new
color code
we'll give the new list for one through
88 counties as far as the incidents and
those are two really different ways of
measuring
um you know the situation that you have
in your particular county so i think
it's
you know we wanted to kind of put these
two together uh and so what you're gonna
see on here
is just the red the red counties
uh right now and then the other counties
that you see on here
uh that are kind of a orange yellow i'm
not quite sure
what that is but uh the other color
there
uh are counties that have a high
incidence
um of of the virus
um high uh counties are ones with
greater than 100
cases per hundred thousand population in
the last
two weeks and so the rest of these
counties are counties that don't fall
into either one of these categories so
to summarize that these are the counties
that we would worry the most about
doesn't mean everybody else's doesn't
have something to worry about
but these are the counties these two
color these counties
are the ones that you have
something something else you know
they're at
either high incident level or they are
a red because they've met enough of
those seven indicators
so again we do kind of see a pattern
uh over in the over in the western
western side of the state
but uh that's again a new map uh we'll
put that up
so people can see it it is a combination
of
several other maps and we kind of put
them together in a different way
to to look at eric let's go to our top
20 ohio counties ranked by highest
occurrence
uh and again uh we start with mercer
athens is now number two looks like
putnam
fulton dark defiance fayette
henry wood all glazed and then we
dropped to lawrence and we keep
keep going from there again uh it's it
is of interest
just geographically most of these first
of all are rural counties
uh and in second with a couple of
exceptions most of them are in
northwest uh western part western part
of the
of the state uh let's go to the 88
eric you're showing that one there and
again that is up and people
anyone can go take a look at those 88
counties you can see where your county
is ranked again
this is by a number of cases uh the last
the last two weeks let's talk for a
moment about uh hospitalization
hospital missions have been declining
had been declining for many weeks since
our peak in mid-july
unfortunately we started to see that
trend change
a few weeks ago as a reminder hospital
admissions are
lagging indicator the data comes a
little
later as folks in the hospital go to
some hospital for something
that they need that kind of particularly
that kind of care
uh so let's look at several of these
this is number of hospital admissions
and you can start to see a trend
this starts over here in april goes all
the way across
if you can't read it all to the week
that we are into
now these data fills in late sometimes
so we might get information today that
might indicate back here
or might indicate here and so
it's probably best not to look at this
this week because it hasn't filled in
fully but you do start to see
a trend going up a little bit not marked
on there yet
uh but we see that trend
our data team showed me some things this
morning i want to share with you and
they've taken hospital
missions and they've really come up with
a
different ways of looking at this
this is hospital admissions by
age as we said earlier in august and
september spread among the young and
healthy
we are afraid will eventually impact
those who are older and more vulnerable
the average age of covet cases
and this is has gone up and
unfortunately so is the average age of
hospitalizations
so this is a relatively new trend in
fact in recent
weeks ohio and 60 and older now account
for about 70 percent of covert hospital
admissions
this is considerably higher than the 50
percent that we saw in july
um it's only natural i think to see
older people
the ones going to the hospital more but
we have seen a marked change just since
july again
50 percent of the people going into our
hospitals for coven
in july were 60 years of age
or older now that number is up to 70
percent who are 60 years of age
or older so again uh you can just
you can kind of see and we'll make this
available on our
our web page um as as well
what you see the colors the dark
darker red purple uh this is
this would be 70 to 79 this would be
this would be 80
plus so you can look at these colors and
these are the two interesting they're
all interesting but you can look at
these two colors and what you will see
is that the older population you know is
is taking more
percentage of those cases going to the
hospital of that
of that population eric let's look at
the next one this is hospital mission by
county type so we break it down into
urban counties
suburban and small metro and rural
counties
and what we're starting to see here what
we are seeing here is the red
the rule again comprise
more of the total number of coveted
cases coveted missions into hospitals
people with covet who are going into
hospitals and so it's just
these are just interesting trends more
rural
we're seeing it more rural and we're
seeing it older
and now let's look uh another way of
looking at this is percentage of
hospital emissions by region
and again these are the regions you can
you'll be able to pull this
down and you can just kind of
make your own conclusions here but the
green
uh the green which is region one
uh north northwest ohio
um and so we're starting to see that uh
we're seeing relatively fewer residents
of the cleveland columbus area
being admitted with code at the same
time are three western regions
one three and six
one three and six as you see them uh
there are seeing a greater percentage of
hospital missions
along with some increases in region 7
and 8 which is southeast ohio
i will make it clear all of our regions
have adequate
capacity remaining in the hospitals
we're certainly keeping a close eye on
it but
but we are okay but it is it is a
geographical
switch and we're seeing an age switch
um let me talk for a moment about
something that's uh
i've heard from a number of
superintendents
and health directors and very very
concerned
um we and let me just say again
um very impressed with what our teachers
are doing
what our principals are doing what our
superintendents are doing they're doing
an absolutely
uh phenomenal job
trying to get as many of the kids back
in school
as they can we've heard from many
superintendents
though about the number of students who
are meeting
the centers for disease control and
prevention's definition of close contact
and are being put into quarantine um
in most cases um you know this is again
this is
this is guidance from the cdc so you
might have
a young person who is in class let's say
a high school student
it's determined that they have coveted
then they go back and determine who they
were seated within
you know a close distance within six
feet uh
and then the cdc guidelines talks about
those individuals being
quarantined
the cdc and i'll just quote part of it
uh
in the context of coven 19 the
definition of a close contact is someone
who is within six feet of a person
diagnosed with coca-19 for a total of 15
minutes or more
um i'll just go down a little bit the
determination of close contact should be
made
this is what the cdc says irrespective
of whether the person with coven 19
or the contact was wearing a mask
and so what people have said to us is
look we're
you know both people were wearing masks
both students were wearing masks
they were within six feet but they were
both wearing masks they were above
15 minutes but they were both wearing
masks and what you know shouldn't that
basically shouldn't that count for
something
so we're looking at this uh frankly
we're our health department and our
health
experts and others who we consult
outside the health department are
very reluctant to change this without
data
so we're going to go out and try to get
some data
and what we're going to do is to take
the new
tests some of the new tests that are
coming in for from the white house
uh that we expect to be here any day uh
we'll ask ohio state uh researchers to
come up with a protocol
uh we're gonna take 10 we think 10
school districts
uh or school buildings in the state and
what we're going to do
is run a test frankly uh of those
individuals who
meet that criteria who would normally
have been quarantined
uh and we're going to follow them with
very frequent
frequent strip test tests these these
strip new strip tests so again well more
details in the future
um this is not the announcement of when
we're going to start it
uh but we're i want to let everyone know
that we are working on this
uh frankly some you know we've seen a
lot of gut-wrenching things and things
that just as
as a parent uh bother me uh you know
kids missing out on school kids missing
out on
activities that they want to be involved
in uh but
frankly you know our medical experts uh
do not feel that we can move off this
without data so what we're gonna look at
to see is okay
let's follow these kids who had this
exposure where both people had mass
they were within six feet of each other
and they were together for more than 15
minutes
uh and we're gonna take some some some
of the some of those
and follow them and just see you know
what they do in fact develop do they in
fact come down
with the covet or or not and what the
percentages are and see if the data
can help inform us as how we move
forward
uh last week i wanted to
we had invited recovery ohio director
alicia nelson
alicia worked with me in the attorney
general's office
she heads up our basically our anti-drug
efforts our recovery efforts
uh in the state and i want to
invite her to join us today
uh to talk about you know some of the
things that that
we are seeing and i know alicia uh
last month uh was recovery ohio month
but
uh for you for the departments um
for every ohio and every month really is
kind of recovery month
um and so tell us a little bit about you
know what you're seeing out there i mean
we we know that um
you know we're seeing uh an increase in
mental health problems we're seeing an
increase
in in in drug use uh drug dependency
and so these are some of the the the
things that have come along with
uh the virus that you know obviously
caused us a great deal of
of concern so alicia i'm going to turn
over to you and kind of tell us
uh maybe what we're doing and what could
be of help
well thank you governor uh first i want
to
echo what you said and thank everyone
who participated last month in national
recovery
month and i'm glad to also be here with
you this week to kick off mental health
awareness week
and talk about what ohio's been working
on to support
those with mental health and substance
use disorders and their families
um as you said uh
we have seen some increases that have
concerned us and what research has
really told us
is that at times of natural disaster or
traumatic events
and in this case in pandemic times it
has proven to be
a time of increased anxiety and stress
for those
across the country and it's been
certainly true in ohio
and what we're seeing is that you know
people who have never had to worry about
mental health or other issues like
stress and anxiety are starting to have
feelings and symptoms of stress and
anxiety
and then those who frequently or
or may struggle with a condition a
mental health condition or substance use
disorder
are seeing their symptoms increase and
so what we have done is wanted to make
sure
that folks knew that our behavioral
health system is
open and we wanted to make sure that
that system remain
open and work to be creative to do uh
that work to to make sure the system
stayed open i guess is what we really
wanted to say
here and one of the ways that we've done
that is through our telehealth system
right now if you have a phone in ohio
you can access
treatment supports in in
really get to talk with someone about
any of the symptoms you're feeling
we also wanted to make sure that
important medication
assisted treatment services through our
opiate treatment programs remained
available
and have really allowed for take-home
dosing
and it really expanded the use of
naloxone as the third
way to make sure that we're looking at
opiate overdose deaths
um and overdoses and really combat those
with any tool that we have in the
toolbox and naloxone is an important
tool for that
so right now if you're in our state you
can access naloxone by mail
through our ohio department of health or
your local department of health's
project down program
along with many other programs across
the state and we felt that that would be
important
as we move forward and continue to
address this crisis
together so
a director in regard to someone
let's say you have someone in your
family uh who
has an addiction problem and you're
concerned that they may have relapsed or
well how do you
how should a person deal with that say
they've got a brother let's say they've
got
a son daughter or somebody and a mother
or somebody in their family
one of the best things that you can do
is is really talk to somebody about what
you're experiencing
and and recognize that the any
differences that you see in your family
members or even in yourself
during these times that you you do have
a support network in the state of ohio
that can help you
and one avenue to get support is the
covic care line that the department of
mental health and addiction
services has set up that tool is
available
seven days a week 24 hours a day
it's a toll-free call-in line you can
call
and talk to somebody about what you're
seeing what you're experiencing what
you're feeling
and they can really help you navigate
through
through that and that number is
1-800-720-9616
again 1-800-720-9616 and if you don't
catch it
live here today we have that up on the
coronavirus website
so even even though it says for covet
and it really
if i call there and i've got someone i
don't have a
a coveted problem i've got a mental
health problem or i've got a drug
addiction problem
um whoever's on that other line will be
able to help me
or help my family and kind of maybe
guide me to where i should go
absolutely it does not have to be covet
related anything that you're feeling
regarding mental health or substance use
disorders or
stress and anxiety at this time you can
reach in that number and someone would
be there to talk to you and
point you in the right direction
director thank you very much
appreciate it thank you for being on
as i do each tuesday i'm going to take a
moment to talk about gun violence in
this state
we should all be sick and tired of
picking up the newspaper and seeing the
things that we see
literally every single day
our fellow ohioans injured or killed
through senseless
violence since i last talked about this
a week ago
at least 42 more people in ohio were
shot
more than half of them 23 men
women children have died um
just this week 23 lives cut short
20 more families who are needlessly
having to grieve
tomorrow will mark one year one year
since senator matt dolan and i announced
legislation to help local law
enforcement to help prosecutors to help
judges
get tougher on those relatively small
number of criminals
who are responsible for most gun
crimes convicted felons
convicted of a crime of violence who
illegally
have guns this legislation
is still pending in front of the
legislature
again would ask the legislature to take
action
eric let's look at some headlines uh in
the past two weeks
two weeks in the past excuse me in the
past week
um two 15 year old boys were killed
on tuesday and i quote fifteen-year-old
one of the latest homicide victims in
columbus
then on thursday in cleveland
fifteen-year-old boy found dead in field
after being shot
it is an absolute tragedy
on friday this headline 12 year old boy
shot in the face
in cleveland's ohio city neighborhood
and will a wick police officer at home
recovering after being shot
during a traffic stop
the child that we were talking about
survived as did the willowy
police officer who was shot in the chest
during a traffic stop
reports say his bulletproof vest may
have been what saved his life
also friday headline
25 year old man fatally shot during
fight at bar on akron's east side
two in critical condition
let's talk a little bit more about this
case according to reports
one person was shot and killed one
person was shot and critically injured
and a third person was critically
injured when she was hit by a car
fleeing the scene
the alleged gunman was arrested a short
time later according to public records
this suspect is a convicted felon
prohibited
from having a gun in fact the suspect
was caught illegally carrying a gun in
the past and was sent back to prison
but for only six months the reality is
oftentimes convicted felons caught
illegally carrying guns
don't go to jail or don't go to prison
very long
we have to change that we need to give
our judges
we need to give our prosecutors we need
to give our police
more flexibility get this relatively
small number of
violent repeat offenders off our streets
the legislation we announced last
october would give judges the authority
to sentence a convicted felon
to up to eight years in prison the first
time they're caught illegally possessing
a gun up to the judge but we give them
that discretion
the possible sentence goes up to 11
years if they're caught with a gun again
after that this legislation is necessary
it will in fact save lives i again ask
the general assembly to work with us
take this measure which we know
absolutely no
might not save every life but it will
save lives
there's no doubt about it let me talk
briefly and then we'll go to the
lieutenant governor
the ongoing pandemic has impacted so
many people
and hurt so many people just besides
those who have gotten sick we have
ohioans who are struggling to pay their
rent
their mortgage water and sewer utility
bills
we are working closely with our partners
in the general assembly
and hope to have something to announce
early next week
about some additional some money that we
will take the coronavirus money
uh that we will take what's called the
cares act dollars and we will take to
help
those people who have pain have to pay
their rent and they're way behind in
their rent
the mortgage second we're also going to
give
some help to our small businesses
and to our non-profits again
many of them are teetering right on the
edge uh
and we know it's been a horrible
horriblely difficult
time for them so we'll be doing this i'm
talking about today and i talked a
little bit about last week just to tell
people
it's coming when we get everything
worked out with the general assembly
and have it ready to go and we can put
it out so that you can
people can start applying um we'll be
able to announce that and we hope we
hope that will be uh
early next week today is the first day
of early voting in ohio
ohio's can go to their county board of
elections to vote in person if they do
not want to or not able to go to the
polls on election day
they also obviously have the the option
of of absentee
uh ballots uh so we encourage everyone
to do that we encourage
you to be kind to you know the poll
workers to the people who are manning
doing the work at the board of elections
as well as the people ultimately who
will be doing it on election day by
you know wearing a mask and standing in
line we saw some pictures and
some of the newspapers that put up this
morning early people standing in lines
and
you know just please be careful uh be
safe
and um let me turn it over to the
lieutenant governor i know lieutenant
governor
as a former secretary of state uh has
been involved in elections a lot and i
know john if you want to say anything
more about that or
uh what other comments that you have
yeah thanks governor
old habits die hard i do would like to
say i was
looking at some of the video showing
people standing in line
and you remember you don't have to stand
in line in ohio
there's still plenty of time to request
an absentee ballot
you can fill that ballot out and you can
either mail it back in or you could drop
it off
at the drop box at that local board of
elections so that same place
that you would be standing in line you
can just request your absentee ballot
fill it out
and just physically drop it off there at
that board of elections so that you
don't
have to stand in a line just one
convenience that the
ohio system of elections allows you that
just a reminder that you could take
advantage of
i appreciate governor the the
acknowledgement of the work that's been
done to
to pull together some of the the efforts
around small business i would like to
talk about
the economy today both in terms of of
how we're recovering from both a health
and
and an economic point of view we all
know that ohio
is home of a lot of great research we
have
wonderful colleges and universities that
do a lot of wonderful things in the area
of innovation
but when we got here one of the things
the innovate ohio team was looking at
that you charge us with governor is to
find out maybe
why some of that that uh great
intellectual property
uh in our colleges and universities was
not being
commercialized why we weren't developing
enough small businesses
as a result of that which we know create
jobs and
help bolster our economy what we found
when we
we looked at that was that it was a
little bureaucratic getting that
intellectual property
out of the university system both from a
standpoint
of contract negotiations and just
speed to market it wasn't it was slow it
was not very entrepreneurial
it was not functioning at the speed of
business so the innovate ohio team
partnered with the ohio department of of
uh educat
ohio department of higher education and
the inner university council who was
who was just instrumental in this uh
looking how we could change it uh to
create less friction save time and money
and move more intellectual property into
the marketplace and that's when
we created the ohio ip promise
the i the ip promise included
14 our 14 public universities and two
privates
case western university and
the university of dayton and the ip
promise
was a uniform transparent way
of taking this intellectual property and
moving it uh
into the marketplace into
commercialization and really to take
these great innovations on our campuses
and helping improve people's lives
and after this one year anniversary i
wanted to give a little report on where
we stand
i had some great conversations with some
of these
universities to talk about their
successes i had a wonderful one last
week with david adams who's
uc's the university of cincinnati's
chief innovation officer
and the head of the uc research
institute uh
after the completion of the ohio ohio ip
promise he noted that
last year university of cincinnati had a
400 percent increase in the number of
startups
that were spun out of uc intellectual
property and this year alone there have
a thousand
percent increase uh amazing work going
on
at the university of cincinnati and
becoming
more entrepreneurial additionally at
ohio
university the a e i o u
scientific has developed technology that
recently won a nasa
i tech ignite the night pitch
competition that helps
and and their technology helps predict
bone weakness
in a non-invasive manner that's
obviously important for nasa but just
think of the
the geriatric and and other health um
implications that uh that this
potentially has health value that this
has
coming out of that research um i will
also note something that happened at the
university of dayton research institute
uh as a result of the ohio ip promise
and that was
uh the development of this of x-rays to
diagnose covet 19
and they used the principles outlined in
the ohio ip promise
to get that to market in just two and a
half days to commercialize that in just
two and a half days
to get it licensed and it's now licensed
and generating revenue for the
university and is being used to
diagnose coveted cases through x-rays
ohio state the ohio state university has
more than 100 active startup companies
in their portfolio
many of them using the ohio ip promise
to
to move forward with this so i want to
thank the ohio department of higher
education
the tech transfer offices at these
universities and the inter university
council
and note that today we will be
announcing three areas of collaboration
for the
ip promise commercialization efforts
first
there will be a statewide
inter-institutional agreement
and these will allow more than two
institutions to jointly own an
invention and to work together to
commercialize it
uh these agreements define the
responsibilities for marketing
uh licensing and the proportional costs
and the royalties and
it's just a new tool that we have to
promote collaboration on universities
uh we're also going to gather uh in the
second component of this gather
statewide
collection of institutional
entrepreneurial resources
a lot of things out there for professors
and researchers to use
the in the entrepreneurial space that
they maybe didn't know exist we're going
to help
make sure they know how to contact how
they can use that information
and then third establish agreements
among the
use inter-university council members to
use a consistent
non-financial starting of terms for
these agreements
as a measurement of the io of the ip
promise success we're going to use
five benchmarks the number of invention
disclosures
the number of technologies licensed the
number of
startups launched the total number of
portfolio funding
and the net promoter score as a measure
of stakeholder satisfaction
the bottom line is is that we're trying
to take the power of innovation
and research on our university campuses
improve people's lives with it
make it easier for entrepreneurs and
businesses to commercialize this
and hopefully light a fire under our
state's economy
with the great talent and research
that's happening in our colleges and
universities
uh five or ten years from now there
there's going to be
a great business that we're all proud of
in ohio
that is the result of the intellectual
property that's sitting on the shelf
somewhere right now
at one of our colleges and universities
that we're going to get off the shelf
turn it in development
and move it into becoming one of these
great business
startups in our state that's what this
is all about and
we're excited about step two of the ohio
ip promise
i've also talked about in my role here
on these
news conferences about how businesses
are are helping us during this coveted
time period
to um help contribute to the health and
the health of our state and also grow
the economy at the same time
we announced a little while ago that
that jobs ohio
and dsa jobs ohio is going to have some
revitalization grants for appalachia
that the development services agency had
some grants for ppe
we we are announcing today that i want
to highlight today during manufacturing
month
that there's a company in jackson county
in southeast ohio
in the heart of appalachia phoenix
quality manufacturing that's announced
that with these grants they're going to
start manufacturing
n95 masks in jackson county it'll create
approximately 40 jobs they're going to
convert
23 000 square feet of former
manufacturing
facility for elemental
products they're going to use this now
to produce n95 masks and
this will this will serve customers in
the region
across the region of our country uh
statewide and
and ultimately we hope nationally and
internationally
and i just want to thank the
collaboration of the private public
collaboration
of of jobs ohio the ohio development
services agency
the ohio valley regional development
commission appalachian growth capital
and
jackson county job and family services
for helping get this started this is
what we said
take we know we need ppe we know we need
jobs we know we need economic
development
putting some of that startup capital in
to get this going and hopefully we'll
be able to sustain this is because we
don't ever want to find ourselves
again in a position where we don't have
adequate ppe
to serve our state and and
also in closing governor let me add that
on ohio means jobs website there are 165
000 jobs currently available eighty one
thousand
seven hundred of them pay over fifty
thousand dollars a year
and uh i just remind people of that you
may be struggling you may
you may have lost your job in one
industry that's been devastated by the
coronavirus pandemic
but there are a lot of others that are
flourishing during this time
frame we need to get you connected with
those uh
we have the training faci the the
training programs available also on that
site and the employers of our state
have done a great job at creating safe
environments
for employees to go to work so use
ohio means jobs is a resource for you to
help you
get your career restarted as we
begin to move forward living with the
coronavirus in our lives and doing so
successfully thanks governor
john that's so very very very important
it's also really exciting
about the n95 mask going to be made in
jackson
ohio we love it this is something that's
we've worked on a long time a lot of
people have worked on to get that done
and we talked about one of the enduring
lessons of this coronavirus is that
never ever again
do we want to be in a position where we
have to import all our
personal protection equipment we don't
want to do that and so
making n95 masks in ohio uh
is a great great thing ready to go to
questions
first question today governor is from
shane stegmiller at hannah news service
thank you governor for taking my
question could you talk about the
decision
to allow the browns and maybe the
bengals to raise their spectator
capacity
and where are you at on raising the
capacity at other sports and
entertainment venues
and also can you talk about the
discussions on lifting the 10 pm alcohol
sales restrictions as well
sure we've made no decision yet on the
10 pm alcohol um
certainly under consideration
you know i understand what this is
doing this does hurt small businesses
people who
running restaurants and bars i'm going
to have an opportunity the next several
days to talk to
a number of representatives from the
restaurant association
we're trying to balance that uh we also
are hearing from
some of our mayors you know one mayor
who's for it but uh we have
most of the other mayors that are
talking to us are saying you know they
do not want to see that done
and so we're trying to balance you know
the
that whole issue of safety at the same
time
you know protecting our small businesses
both of these things are important and
so
you know that's what we're trying that's
what we're trying to uh
to balance as far as the bengals and the
browns
uh we started by uh first games
uh at 6 000 people um
i don't know the exact capacity but you
know we're over 50 000
uh i think in both both uh
places and uh we kind of looked at that
we talked to the
local health departments we talked to
local officials
uh to see what impact that had uh it
looked like uh
it was it was safe uh they really didn't
have any incidents
um so thought we could take it up to 12.
this would give more football fans uh in
ohio
uh the opportunity to go but also do it
in
in a safe way uh and i think we're
probably at where we're gonna stop
uh and i made it very clear to the
ownership of the browns and the bengals
that
you know this is a
game by game but we don't see any reason
that it couldn't continue at at twelve
thousand
uh people that would seem to be a
reasonable thing
uh we have our overall guidelines um we
look at each case
uh just as we did with with high school
football we had variances and
we gave some variances there so we're
trying to provide the broad guidelines
in the big
uh big events you know again we try to
measure everything to make sure that it
is in fact
uh safe and we also look at frankly the
you know the impact on
what's going on downtown and other
things
next question is from jackie borchardt
at the cincinnati enquirer
hey jackie hey how are you um
you mentioned uh this school study using
the rapid engine tests
um rapid engine tests have only been
approved by the fda to test people with
symptoms
and the cdc has said several times that
even if you get a negative test
and you've been exposed you should still
quarantine for for 14 days
so i was hoping to talk a little bit
more about why you think
an ohio-based school study would show
something different than what the the
various cdc studies have shown is this
just a
um just just appease the school
officials
no um look
we don't want to move away from cdc
unless there's some data that shows that
we
are safe and moving away from cdc
you know getting a study in ohio schools
that is spread out among different
demographics
will provide us with more information it
does not mean there'll be a decision
to move uh doesn't mean anything it
simply means we're trying to get some
additional
additional information uh we are looking
at how to use these tests
as you know ohio
will be receiving about 128
000 of these tests we believe every
seven to ten days
uh and we we continue to work on how
we're going to deploy them to save lives
how we're going to deploy them to allow
ohioans to
uh to do more things and try to do more
things safely
so this would come into the second
category but
we're going to see what the test what
what we come up with and
we're going to go with the facts next
question
is from sean lanier at wcmh in columbus
governor dewine as you may know the uh
columbus city council just repealed
their
curfew their 10 pm curfew understanding
that the
statewide last call order is in place i
know you just touched on it a little bit
but is there any type of timeline that
you're looking at
to to make an announcement is there any
any indicators
that you're looking at or or a
specialist that are talking to you about
uh when this could possibly change i
understand that you're trying to balance
the safety but also the sustainability
of these
bars and restaurants that are hurting
because of this order
sure mayor genthan and i talk at least
twice a week usually
four or five times a week and you know
he he knows that we're looking at this
he's very aware of the fact that we are
we are looking at this
um you know he's expressed his opinion
that uh he hopes we don't change it
uh we have mayor cranley uh in
cincinnati who
wants us to change it uh so we you know
we take all the information
and we try to balance these these things
um
want to keep our economy going want to
protect our small business but at the
same time
um you know we're watching the numbers
uh watching what's happening and trying
to you know keep ohio from
spiking up uh flaring flaring up so
it's it's no different than many of the
other decisions we make frankly uh
there's no there's no easy answer and
there's no no perfect answer
and there's usually a two answers that
uh
neither one are perfect and you know
both are kind of in one sense once
try to figure out which is the worst
alternative so we're looking at these
things and we're trying to
trying to weigh this out next question
is from andrew welsh huggins at the
associated press
happy birthday andrew i hear it might be
your birthday today
hi governor it is thank you very much i
really appreciate that
um i just had two quick questions uh
following up on the small business uh
renter mortgage aid package that you're
working on that you mentioned earlier
um so in terms of making the money
available
quickly how seriously are you looking at
an option like
the controlling board as the fastest
method to deliver the aid
and then longer term especially with
last week's report that initial
unemployment claims ticked back up what
are your concerns that small businesses
and low-income renters are going to
need even more help down the road than
what this package can deliver
well they certainly may need more that
we can deliver
with this package as far as using the
controlling board
of course that is a creature of the
state legislature
you know there's two ways to get money
out you can we can pass a bill
or we can you know go through the
controlling board in either case
you know we need um the support of the
legislature
uh so this is a dual project and uh you
know i feel good though i think that
we're
coming close to having this thing worked
out about what we can do now
uh and because we want to get some of
this money out but
i i think you're right i mean we could
be
you know we don't know how long we're
going to see a downturn in the economy i
mean we
we're we're battling back we're doing
things but
we still have a lot of people hurting
and we need to you know we need to be
able to give them some relief
uh you know part of this a mental health
issue if you're sitting there and you
got you know number of months of rent
back and uh you know you're worried
about your family
uh you're worried about where is that
money going to come from am i going to
get evicted from my house am i going to
get evicted from my apartment
you know none of that's good none of
that is good
and so we want to provide some relief
there
that money will go out also and and
you know will spread throughout the
economy uh very quickly
uh it will help the landlord who owns it
might have a mortgage to pay too
and so it will have a big big impact i
think as we as we put this money out
and you know what we balance as we look
at this
is to make sure that we have um
sufficient money for the testing that
we're going to need
we also have a big question mark out
there and that's what congress is going
to do
and whether or not congress is going to
you know allow us to carry this money
over until next year
uh is the congress going to pass a
separate bill where they provide
additional funds to do different things
and so we're
we're kind of we're waiting but we can't
wait and
this is something that we think that we
can set this money aside we can push
this money out we can help people now at
the same time we'll still have money
back you know in regard to the testing
and the other things that we absolutely
have to have the money to be able to do
to fight this virus
thank you next question is from mike
livingston at gangwar news service
hi governor uh regarding your strong
ohio
proposal obviously the lame duck session
is quickly approaching if this
does not pass this ga what's your plan
you bring it back next year do you maybe
try to narrow the soap to make it an
easier lift
thanks mike you know i'm i'm an eternal
optimist
and i'm not going to talk about what
happens if we if we don't get it passed
uh we're gonna we're gonna stay on this
and uh we look forward to a you know
lame duck session where we can
we can do some of these things
next question is from jeff redick at
wsyx in columbus
good afternoon governor you touched on
the president's remarks
much has been made of the fact that he
said we shouldn't be afraid of the virus
and how his condition improved
he also received an experimental
cocktail of drugs not widely available
and i'm just curious what your efforts
or the health department's efforts are
to
improve treatments in ohio such that
they might be more in line
with the great care the president
received at some point in the future
well i think we all want the president
to have the best care that was
possible uh we would want that for our
president
as far as
getting drugs getting care
to people who have coveted uh this is an
area frankly
uh where i think we've seen some
significant
increase in in the ability to care for
patients
um still have people dying we saw people
going to the hospital
but uh there are more tools available
today there's more knowledge available
in regard to
to the doctors this is an area where i
take no credit
this is what doctors have done this is
what the medical community has done
this is what the researchers have done
so when we're talking about
getting drugs more drugs to individuals
more therapeutic
more ability to deal with people you
know how you treat someone
covert that's out that's out of my
league i take no credit for it but we
are going up and we're moving
in the right direction not just in ohio
but as a country
we have some of the world's most premier
medical institutions uh in the state of
ohio
and some of the most amazing doctors and
researchers
so we are contributing uh in ohio
not me but we're contributing to to the
knowledge base that exists around this
uh this very very dangerous virus
and that will continue and we'll
continue to move move forward on that
governor if i could if i could add um
one thing
well as the governor stated you know
we're not we're not the doctors but what
we do is we do respond when ohio's
doctors ask us to
when they've needed contacts with the
fda
to help speed up the process for
convalescent plasma treatments and other
things
that they've asked us to do we've
engaged with our medical community
to provide the support and the help that
we can to help them
do what they think is best so we've been
we've been taking our cues from
the medical leaders and we have great
hospitals and institutions in this state
and
we have responded uh by reaching out to
to try to get those clearances for those
experimental treatments as as quickly as
we can to serve the people of ohio
next question is from alex ebert at
bloomberg
good afternoon governor thanks for this
opportunity hey
on sunday in an interview you said that
president trump's administration
was not helping state officials with
contract tracing after
the cleveland debate last week can you
clarify if that is still the case
and if they are helping what are they
doing to do contact tracing
following the debate thank you yeah i
think
i think what i said or what i meant to
say uh was i was not aware of that going
on uh on on two occasions i have talked
uh
to the ceo of the cleveland clinic about
this
issue um you know what he told me
is you know in the room itself um
you know everyone had tested negative uh
they had people spaced out i was not in
the room
but he felt that the only person uh you
know that would need necessarily to be
contact traced probably
uh would it would have been um mr
wallace
uh and of course we saw that he he got a
test later
so you know as far as contract contact
excuse me contact tracing within that
room
i don't know that there was anything uh
you know that
should have been done but again
cleveland clinic is
is there they're the ones who would have
been in contact with the local health
department
if something was was going to happen as
a direct result of that
that movement to the president coming in
and the president leaving
so and that's that's really the you know
the extent of my
my knowledge of it next question is from
carl hunnell
at richlandsource.com
oh sorry good afternoon governor
uh richland county on thursday may
become the state's first
level four county under the public
health advisory system
and that's based at least in part on
outbreaks in the two state prisons here
what exactly does this designation mean
in terms of restrictions for residents
schools and businesses in this county
and is it fair to local residents to
have the purple designation be made
when one of the drivers is the two state
prisons here thank you
yeah for some of the things that we look
at carl
uh the prison is removed from there and
uh i i'm gonna let our statisticians
our data people get that information to
you and to everyone
exactly what the prison
outbreak which there certainly is one
what it impacts and what it does not in
answer to your question
these color codes are really to inform
people
of the nature of a um problem
so you know you start at the yellow you
go the orange and then
into the red uh and then of course there
would be
potentially the purple there but
if they would go purple if they would go
purple um
again it means nothing as far as
what the state is telling them to do
uh it's again red is the indicator
that people should say okay look we we
got a problem here what's what's going
on and let's look at the
data and let's you know is our mask
wearing high enough
uh etc there's no punitive action by the
state of ohio
and yes you know we fully realize there
is a prison there
and and citizens of the community are
not responsible for what
that goes on in the prison
the fact is however that people who live
in richland county work in the prison as
do people i'm sure from many counties
around
and so you know it does have an impact
um you know on what's going on in in
in the community and the color would
might
you know reflect that uh but we'll get
you
a break out of the indicators and which
indicators you know has anything to do
with
with with the prison but uh you know
again
i think people should be alert now
uh that we do have significant spread in
the county
plus we have in other indicators of use
uh of medical whether it's an emergency
room
whether it's in a doctor's office you
know those indicators going off
which says hey we got a we have a
problem but we also have
these are early indicators that there's
there's more of a problem could be more
of a problem down the road
that's all we're trying to do you know
the map i put up
a few minutes ago at the beginning where
we put the high incidence counties
and we put the counties with the
different colors those are just
trying to alert people hey this is
what's going on
in you know in your community and we
think uh
because you know we want to be
transparent we want to give people the
best information
we can but we'll have some more for you
next question is from ben schwartz at
wcpo
in cincinnati hey ben governor
um do you think that president trump's
reaction to his positive covid test
is endangering ohioans at all
specifically
about his and his administration's
willingness to take off their masks
while around others and the example
they're setting while the state is still
encouraging ohioans to wear masks while
possible
yeah ben i mean i i talked earlier about
what i think we should take away from
this and one of the things that we
should take away from this
is that um frequent testing
which we can assume everybody had
um is important but it does not
substitute for wearing a mask because
it's not substitute for keeping me
a distance um and look
i've made no uh secret of this
you know i wish the president would wear
the mask
more i wish he'd wear it all the time
when he was in public uh
and i said that before you know he had
the coronavirus
so you know but what i try to distill
down
uh for the people 11.7 million people i
represent in ohio
uh is what can we take away from this uh
what lessons
that are lessons that we can focus on
uh you know we're not we're not the
president uh
we're not gonna fly in a helicopter
probably you know unless there's
some emergency and their flight comes
and gets us but
for the average person what do we take
away from this what do all of us in ohio
take away from that and i think
the lesson about the testing that
testing is very important
but it's not a substitute for the mass
not a substitute for the distance not a
substitute for for those other things
um and we just should have a i think a
renewed sense
that we can live with this but we got to
be tough we got to be strong
and uh we've got to be resilient and and
part of that is wearing a mask
um so there's there's some lessons from
what what happened with with the
president and we should learn from some
of these things
next question is from laura hancock at
cleveland.com
good afternoon governor hello hi i'm
circling back
to the cleveland browns spectator
decision
the owners and upper management of at
the browns had requested
you guys increase it from a range
between around 11 000
to around 16 000 spectators
what was the science that made you guys
settle at 12
000 and like what's the science that has
you can
um concluding that the cap this season
needs to be around 12 000 spectators
i'm sorry i missed the last sentence
give me the last sentence again
um what is the science that has you guys
um concluding that you need to cap the
spectators
at 12 000 this season
yeah part of this is an art part of this
is an art as well as a science but we
you know we try to go by the science and
the sciences is pretty basic um the
science is outside is generally
better than inside not always as
certainly as we found out in in the in
the rose garden doesn't guarantee you're
going to be safe
but it's better than certainly being
being inside
um distance is important and
you know the ability to wear a mask um
and the team requiring and the people
who
run the game run the stadium requiring
people to keep their mask on
you know these were all things that were
important and so what we wanted to do
with both the browns and bengals is
start with 6
000. you know as you saw for if you
watched
any of these games on tv uh it's they're
pretty spread out
uh it's 6 000. and we want to try that
and see okay how's that going to work
how's the flow into the game
going to work how's it used to restrooms
going to work
and the health departments of both those
cities were were there
and were able to observe that
uh the mayors and their health
departments you know we were able to
contact them so we started with six
thousand it just
you know we felt fairly safe with that
um
and we figured that doubling that uh
spreading it out
all over the stadium would still allow
enough room
uh could it could have been 13 000 could
have been 11 000
yeah it's uh you know we kind of looked
at what we had at 6 000
felt very comfortable with that feel
comfortable at doubling it
um you know that's probably about as far
as where
we're going to go uh you know again we
have an obligation to
provide a safe environment for people
who go in there they're going to be
there a long time
these games last three hours sometimes a
little longer
so people get there half an hour before
the game they're going to be there maybe
up to close to four hours
so it's a long time to be in your seat
and so the proximity is certainly there
so you want to keep people spread out
but there's no you know there's no magic
about 12 it just seemed to be
the right the right place to come out
knowing and following
the basic health guidelines that we've
been hearing and talking about
next question is from jim oddy at
w-h-i-o
in dayton hey jim hey governor
um given the fact that the president now
says don't fear the coveton yours now
saying
well continue with caution uh i'm
talking about now about upcoming events
trick or treat is the next one coming
what are you recommending to parents
they
should they continue their halloween
events trick-or-treat even if they still
live in a county where there's some
spread
i'm thinking of mercer county here even
though they live in a level three
a red county i'm thinking in montgomery
county there what are you telling
parents now are trying to make sense of
this
uh look jim whatever you're doing uh you
know looking at what
how widespread uh
spread is uh of course in your county
matters
i mean you know you can just go through
and think
uh you know if your child's knocking on
x number of doors where your odds have
gone up
that somebody inside might have covered
they might not even know it
so you know these are we try to help
families make these decisions based upon
is
your county high incidence how high is
that
is it a red county and to look at these
things
that's just it's one piece of
information
but there's so many other variables
you know could you go with your young
child and trick-or-treat
if you're exceedingly careful
you know i think it depends on how many
people how many uh
ghosts and goblins are running around
that neighborhood you know the more and
you're bumping into more people it's
kind of you know
not not not what you want to see so i
think you know
spreading that kids out um and i'm not
recommending that people do it or don't
do it i just think this is a parent
decision but we have an obligation to
inform parents of
you know the best available information
and so you know we remain concerned
uh you know about close contact
uh with other kids close contact with
that person at that door
uh and so you know somebody came up with
a recommendation of you know if you
could set out
things that you know a child could pick
up
uh and separated enough from the other
things that might be difficult the other
pieces of candy you know these are all
things that
that people can work on and people are
very creative at halloween and you know
they can put some of that creativity
towards trying to keep the kids safe
who go i think when you get away from
that and you go to parties
uh you go to big gatherings
downtown you know those make no sense
um you know those just don't don't make
any sense
uh and i think for the normal classic
trick-or-treating
i think we leave this up to parents we
leave this up to communities
they should be informed by what is going
on out there
in their in their particular their
particular county
next question is from andy chao at ohio
public radio and television
andy hi governor hi governor uh jumping
off on
sort of uh jeff's question and the idea
of learning lessons
from the president's diagnosis and and i
think you might have said this and i
just kind of want to be clear
does the state plan on reaching out to
the white house to learn
more about the treatment that the
president received to
to see if maybe there could be advances
in treatment for people here in ohio
based on the treatment that the
president received
yeah again again um you know we will do
what any
uh anytime any of our uh
great hospitals ask us what to do in
other words if they can't get
information so if any of our hospitals
needed that information we would
certainly make the phone call do
whatever needed to be done
but they are really good and
i i just can guarantee you that our
hospitals
are looking at you know every single
possibility
to keep people alive to allow them to
recover
we have very very very good hospitals
and our bigger hospitals
are sharing information with our smaller
hospitals
uh you know we put together a system
with the ohio hospital association
early on this pandemic uh where we have
partnered larger
larger more research oriented
institutions with our smaller
county hospitals and uh there's that
relation
that exists so you know anytime that we
can
be of help in that area to facilitate
that we'll do that
and you know as a result of your
question i certainly will
call uh some of our contacts at uh some
of our major hospitals and
and see if there's anything that we can
do but knowing them
uh they're way way up on it and uh you
know they're looking at these different
drugs they're aware of what drugs the
president
uh utilize they're aware of what the
availability of those drugs would be
but i'll have those conversations with
our major hospitals
good idea next question is from jim
province at the toledo blade
hi governor hi jim hi this this question
will be for you and for the lieutenant
governor
um have both of you requested absentee
ballots is that how you plan to vote
does the first lady plan to vote that
way
well i've not asked the first lady so
we've not had that discussion
we've talked a little bit about it early
on
i don't know how we're going to vote yet
you know we normally vote
uh here in cedarville and go in and vote
in person
um but uh i'll check with fran
i don't know if john's on there or not
throughout the years i voted everywhere
i voted early in person
i voted by mail and voted in person on
election day
as of right now i intend to vote in
person on election day
wearing my mask and joining my wife and
we'll go and we'll vote
next question is from jack windsor at
wmfd
in mansfield governor
hello sir uh two quick scenarios with
the same fundamental question uh today a
female student
would have been the first golfer from
eastern pike high to ever compete in the
district tournament
but because she was named as a contact
in a coveted case the ohio department of
health wouldn't let it
play despite her not being sick and
despite pleas from the pike county
health district uh as carl hunnell
mentioned richland county
may go purple on thursday despite
two tenths of one percent of the
population
being infected in july you said the
advisory system was made for local
leaders to make decisions and it appears
that's also what you said today so
governor
why was the high school golfer denied
the chance to play if the local
officials are allowed to make the
decisions
and what can you be more specific about
what powers
elected officials have regarding schools
businesses and other measures
here in richland county well as far as
richland county i think i answered that
with the other question um you know
again
going purple uh you know has no
consequences or sanctions from the state
of ohio
and that's the same way as being read
let me talk about the student golfer
but i want to talk about all student
athletes
there's been a lot of things uh
throughout uh this
pandemic that has been very sad
uh caused me a lot of anguish uh
but it's not about me it's about what
these kids are
going through um i talked earlier about
nursing homes where we had to shut the
nursing homes down as far as visitors
we did it to keep people safe but we
also
what happened was that people got you
know weren't able to see their loved
ones and with horror you know many times
very difficult consequences and uh
you know i've heard directly from from
people who've lost a parent
and who felt their parent died because
no one could go visit the parent
um we've heard i've talked with
superintendents we've got a lot of
emails from superintendents
who talk about you know cdc guidelines
which are the state guidelines which are
which are
followed by local health departments
and saying can't we change those what do
you do about the student
you know who um is sitting by another
student
and um there were
within six feet they're too they're
close uh
because the school is back in you can't
spread them out anymore
and one the student one student comes
down and
yeah you gotta confirm case of the virus
and then
people who have been around that student
that day who've been around them for
more than 15 minutes
end up you end up being quarantined so
we've really been looking at this
our health advisors not just in the
health department
but but our main doctors around the
state
uh are very reluctant frankly to change
that guidance
uh unless there's some data that
indicates that
you know that spread with two people
having a mask on three feet apart or
four feet or five feet or whatever it is
uh that the incidence of spread is very
very very low
and if it's not very low uh or you know
then there's a feeling that we should
not change that and so my heart goes out
to to the student who you're talking
about
uh it goes out to you know runners who
can't run
football players who can't play football
uh you know soccer players who can't
play
volleyball players uh you know goes out
to
a student who's in drama
a student who is doing wants to do
something else and they can't do it
or just a student who can't go to school
uh
but those are the generally accepted
best practices guidelines um
and what we're trying to do with the
study that i talked about is to
figure out hey is there a way we can
lessen those is there a way
that we can get real data look at it in
ohio
from a representative sample of students
students who have been exposed
within that six feet over 15 minutes
and track them and have them take three
tests a week or whatever the the experts
tell us
and do be regularly tested and follow
that and come up with some data
that may be able to allow us to change
this
we started this as you recall
uh with many people saying i want to
have my kids personally in school
i don't want them to be remote so we let
schools make that decision we let
parents make that decision which is the
right
thing to do we thought we still do uh
same way as sports we said let them go
play
but we also said we're gonna have to
file basic health guidelines
and these are the basic health
guidelines that we're gonna have to
follow
uh so it's it's it's it's a tough
situation for her i'm very very sorry
for her
i know that doesn't help her a bit but
i'm very sorry for her i think if this
was my
my child how upset i would be and i
understand that
but we've got to try to keep people safe
at the same time we're trying to get as
many
kids out playing sports and going to
school as we can
um i think that's the last question uh
we'll look forward to seeing you all
on thursday thank you very much
[Music]
you
