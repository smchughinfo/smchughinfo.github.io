allens who get both the flu and covet 19
at the same time doctors tell us this
could be very very dangerous
a flu season will be upon us
certainly very soon and anyone can get
vaccinated against the flu
anybody who can should do so the first
lady and i will be getting vaccinated
today
and then lieutenant governor will be
getting vaccinated in columbus
we certainly encourage everyone who can
to
get vaccinated as soon as possible the
centers for disease control and
prevention
advises that anyone who can and is six
months or older
gets vaccinated against the flu this
includes pregnant women
whose vaccinations can protect their
babies in the time after birth
our youngest and oldest ohioans those
who are pregnant those in long-term care
facilities those
with chronic health conditions may be
especially susceptible
to severe illness or complications from
the flu
it's extremely important to get
vaccinated also if you're an essential
worker people 65 years and older are at
the highest
risk for flu related deaths they have a
poor
immune responses to flu vaccines than
younger people
and for adults of this age they should
get a high dose
if you're elderly and need help getting
to your physician or a location that
offers flu shots
we encourage older ohioans to contact
their local area
agency on aging at
866-243-5678
area agency on aging at 866-243-5678
they can connect you with resources in
your area for transportation and for
other services
children younger than five and
especially those younger than two
are at a high risk of developing serious
flu-related
complications some children between the
age of six months and eight years should
receive two doses of vaccines
for adequate protection now this is the
case for children
of this age who are getting vaccinated
for the first time and those who have
only previously gotten one dose of
vaccine
obviously talk to your pediatrician your
local physician to learn whether your
child should get the two
dose regiment or not many ohioans
may be accustomed to getting their
annual flu vaccine in the workplace we
know with many people working from home
maybe that will not be possible this
year but there are still ample locations
for getting vaccinated
local health departments health care
locations pharmacies across the state
if you don't have a primary health care
provider and don't know where to get a
vaccine visit vaccine
finder that's vaccine finder dot org
fran i want to thank today our primary
care physician
our friend dr kevin sherritt from the
kettering health network
we thank him for making a house call
today so kevin thank you very very much
for coming
and fran i will we'll get a shot
let's just put this right up here all
right okay
all right where you want it
you're the doctor what are you saying

problem with your white
shirt
thanks kevin thank you very much fran
let you slip over
make it there
so
friend you came better prepared
no adjustment

she's tough
there you go all right dr sheriff thank
you
very very much and we'll now go to
columbus for
john houston john hi governor
we're uh going to get going here
catherine joseph
is uh the nurse and uh runs the
immunization program
manager here at columbus public health
so she's going to give me a
a shot
it's also uh worth noting that you know
while it's important that we get the flu
shot so we don't get the flu
uh we're also trying to free up that
supply chain uh
for when hopefully the uh
vaccine is available for the coronavirus
so
uh it's really important that we do that
so that the refrigeration is available
so that uh
people like catherine who provide the
immunizations or
vaccinations i should say are there and
ready to enable to help us
all done all right thank you governor
we're ready to go
all right thank you very much
well you may have noticed today fran i
have orange on
uh this is an honor of hunger action
month
uh today is also hunger action day
where we're encouraged to get connected
to volunteer opportunities
to donate and really to raise awareness
about the problem of hunger i'm proud of
the members of our ohio national guard
who have really stepped up and who have
served many many missions supporting our
food banks
and food distribution centers across the
state of ohio
their work kept many of these facilities
or helped keep many of these facilities
going and we appreciate that
that very fine fine work to help the
ohio association of food banks
uh is recruiting 25
full-time americorps vista national
service
individuals as part of a new program to
respond to cobot 19's
impact on our food security
ohio is one of four states selected to
participate in this
pilot to learn more and if anyone
wants to apply or you know of anyone who
wants to apply visit ohiofoodbanks.org
recruitment now i'm going to turn it
over to fran
friend
and so i'm i'm happy to be helping on
this uh
hunger action day because it's so
important you know nutrition plays such
a big
part in our lives you know on our old
people and
especially in our children and that's
why these food banks are such a vital
part of our resource of our communities
over the past seven months ohio's food
banks have been finding
really creative solutions to continue
providing healthy
food to anyone in need no questions
asked
i encourage everyone to check out
the website www.ohiofoodbanks.org
coronavirus and you'll find ways that
you can help and get help
our schools have been doing an
incredible job they're providing free
meals both
to kids that are in person learning
and remote learning this is through the
end of december thirty
december thirty first of this year they
distribute
meals to remote learners such as
community pickup locations home delivery
and bus stop drop-offs they offer
multi-day meal packs with value
with breakfast and lunches for multiple
days to save families both time
and travel and provide meal service
including weekends and holidays
so these are just such important things
so you know it's also a time it's a day
when you can think about
you know if you need help you can get
help
and how you can help and i think you
know whether you're a public citizen and
want to contribute to the food banks
or if you are a corporation and want to
contribute even our one of our grandsons
did an eagle scout project that even
helped with that
uh with their local food bank so it's a
it's a day to really think about that
and to
to realize this is a resource for
everyone
you know and i hope if you need it
you'll take advantage of it thank you
thank you my friend
you know i think we we all know uh all
the
things that this chronovirus have caused
and certainly food insecurity is
something
um that we we have to deal with and
there are people out there who really
need the food so as fran says if you can
donate if you can help if you can
volunteer
um that that would be that would be
great we are
all in this together and one of the
great things
the last six months has been to see ohio
and just really really pulling together
let's go to the slides eric we'll start
with our
regular data slide
we look at the number of cases 11 21
what we know of course is during the
weekend particularly the holiday weekend
these numbers were down
uh they're back up now eleven hundred
um deaths and i would just remind people
because we have questions about
the deaths and people look at these
numbers and with the deaths
what we're doing is simply reporting the
number that we have reported that day
uh then for the full data it may have
been five days ago ten days ago
those are slotted in for those days but
the number you're seeing here
is what has been reported in that in
that last 20
24 hours so eric let's take a look at
the next
next one
well this is you know an advisory and we
put this up only as an advisory we do it
once a week we do it on wednesday
it is it is posted uh and what you'll
see on here
are the states that we uh you know
advise that if you're going to be
traveling to just understand
that the positivity rate is is
particularly high
all these are actually 18 with the
exception of north dakota
uh that is at 19 positivity that is a
high positivity
so the advisory uh is for leisure and
business travel we ask that be followed
by ohioans and out of state travelers
this week four states have a positivity
rate of 15
or higher uh north dakota south dakota
kansas and alabama so again we just
advise people if you're
if you're growing understand that that's
a high rate
uh it you know it as we discuss it's
not always just about where you're going
that's part of it
but it's also about what you do when you
when you were there
okay let's look at eric the case numbers
by age
this is a slide
that our team has put together and it
starts off in in march you see
percentage of cases and then into into
september
and as you can see as far as cases um
this first group 0 to 19 is the first
line and 20 to 29.
so if you look at in september now we're
only we're in a partial month we don't
obviously have the full data for
september we're a long way from that if
you just look at the days so far
in in september uh you know
significant number of cases uh 56 or so
cases that are between the age of zero
and 29
as a percentage so um
again these numbers if you look at
august which is a complete month
which is probably a better month to look
at um
0 to 19 it's 16
the cases made up of that group of
people
uh 22 at the age of 20 to 29.
so again these have been these are going
up they've kind of stabilized now
but again it's just it's just
interesting to see where these cases
uh are eric you want to pull the next
slide
this is hospitalization by age group
uh so you take each age group and
what you look at is the percentage of
those people who got
covered uh who tested uh who tested
positive those people who got coveted
how many of them ended up
in the hospital and so
no real surprise one caution
this is not 100 this is only up to 30
so you know obviously the top groups
that end up in the hospital or the older
the older individuals but also note
the most the youngest so most youngest
five percent
zero to four or five percent of them
ended up in a hospital
um you know up to 30 a little bit better
than 30
in the 80 to uh down to
70. so again no no huge surprises
sort of the things we've been saying but
this is a ohio data
and this tells you kind of what what we
are seeing uh
in ohio eric let's go to the uh county
color update
um and a lot of this is stabilized
for good or bad 68 of our counties
stayed the same level this week
nine counties dropped from orange to
yellow so more yellow counties we like
that a lot
uh great improvement lucas county wayne
county dropped
from red to orange again we're happy
about that
we have six red counties uh tier three
uh that's down from seven last week this
re this year this
week's red counties uh butler
mercer montgomery preble putnam and
summit county
two of these six counties mercer and
preble
only meet the cdc's threshold for high
incidents
but because they were already there they
stay there we'll talk more about those
in in just a moment let's talk now about
the red
counties let's start with putnam county
uh putnam county is at a high level
of cases uh 280 cases per 100 000
population putnam county has had
95 cases during the past two weeks uh
the county's
total since the beginning of the
pandemic is 430 cases so you can see
they're getting a lot of them in a rush
county is seeing a sustained increase in
new cases growing from an average of
five cases per day on august 19th
to an average of 11 cases on august 29th
primary source of spread in putnam
county is within families
uh for example mom gets it and then
comes home gives it to other family
members or dad gets it or
child gets it but it's within in
families
basically spread within the community
let's go down to butler county uh butler
county's numbers certainly are still
being influenced by
uh what's going on at miami university
uh between september
2nd and 20 and excuse me between
september 2nd and 8th
there were 545 student positive cases
the previous week there are 495 cases
these numbers are certainly impacting
the county's sustained increase in new
cases
in addition to the miami university
student cases there are small outbreaks
at workplaces
and long-term care facilities
let's go up northwest ohio to mercer
county
mercer county continues as red because
they meet the cdc's threshold for high
incidence uh their number is 206
uh cases per hundred thousand uh their
per case number
uh sadly increased uh this past week
from 179 last week to 206 this week
so we'd seen coming down from mercer
county for a couple weeks now we've seen
it starting to go back
up still a very high level mercer county
continues to
see spread throughout the community
they've had
outbreaks in workplaces they've had
long-term care facilities and they've
got
just pretty much spread throughout the
county
montgomery county one of our
more urban counties while during the
total two-week reporting period
montgomery county had a sustained
increase
in new cases the county is seeing a
decline
in cases during the most recent week of
reporting remember we go
we look at two weeks always so the last
week has been better
we're seeing a lowering of cases coming
out of the university of dayton
during the past three days they only had
31 cases
they have a total of 962 total recovered
cases so
962 recovered ud has shifted their
classes
to remote through september 14th
to slow the spread in this new
university of dayton student cases there
continues to be small workplace
spread and long-term care facility
outbreaks as well
over west they're there to prevail
county
their case number is 105 so if they can
get below 105
for a two-week period we hope that next
next week they will drop below the red
parable county's cases have decreased
during the past three
weeks from an average of 146 cases cases
to 122. the county is ending the past
two weeks an
average of 105 cases
the county continues on this trajectory
it should drop from red to orange next
week so again
most important part they're moving the
right direction
uh and we hope that preble can get that
below 100 and
move off off the red summit county
seeing a sustained increase sadly in
emergency department visits for
covet-like illness
that is an early warning sign on august
20th the county had an average of five
visits per day to the emergency
department
that number increased to an average of
nine visits
per day by august 27th
county also seen a sustained increase in
hospitalizations
admission numbers have increased from
two admissions
on august 22nd to seven on august 29th
outbreaks have been associated with
workplaces and a fraternal club
i want to take a minute and talk about
the fraternal club
outbreak we're not certainly not going
to identify it but
like many of the clubs that are found
throughout our state
a non-profit has a restaurant has a bar
in this case two people visit the club
while they were contagious
since then employees other members and
family members
uh got the virus no no indication
obviously
these people who came at knew that they
were contagious
people don't most the time know that
it's at least a lot of the time they
don't know that so
again two people came they visited um
and then we saw uh other
other members and family members get the
virus total 12 people tested positive
only one of the people had was
with symptoms the cases range in
age from 29 to 81
and four people have been hospitalized
who are seriously ill
look we don't share these stories to
make people feel bad
this is just a horrible horrible
situation
i don't think anyone wanted to make
anyone sick
none of us want to make anyone sick but
the story just illustrates how this can
happen
in what would appear to be a very a
benign friendly
situation uh so we just ask people to
wear masks keep the social distance and
do all the things that
uh everyone talks about in the in the
health community
um let's go eric to our
top 10 counties again what this
what this represents and this is the top
this is the top ten
uh you can see on our web page the top
88 we'll stay eric just with the top ten
um these are counties that
no matter what their color uh meet the
cdc's threshold of height what they call
high incidence which means over a
hundred
cases per hundred thousand over a two
week period of time
a county is flagged as high incidence
when has more than 100 cases per hundred
thousand residents over the past two
weeks
uh cdc uses this as a definition of high
incidence
um why do we worry about these counties
well it means that cases are rising
steadily in a county
uh even if that county doesn't meet one
of our under other indicators they have
a significant number of cases
having a large number of cases can lead
to rapid virus transmission throughout
the county if steps aren't taken too
slow the spread
four new count four counties moved to a
high incidence list this week
and i want to talk briefly about them
first is clark county
springfield area wittenberg university
located in springfield is certainly
contributing to the increased number of
cases
uh and again we see this uh throughout
the state with colleges as
students are coming back university is
reporting on its dashboard so anybody
can go look at that
the cases have increased to more than 70
this week these cases are being
associated with
out-of-class social gatherings and again
that's a common theme as we've seen in
in our schools to help combat to the
spread the university announced on
september 9th
the classes will be remote for two weeks
after several weeks of being below the
high incident threshold hamilton county
is back on the list barely but they are
back 103 cases per hundred thousand
the county has seen small outbreaks in
high school college and workplace
settings along with other
sources of community spread the
university of cincinnati is reporting
143 cases
in the past 15 days which does
contribute to that
in late august miami county
had some small workplace and church
outbreaks this week a nursing home
outbreak was identified
and already has more than a dozen cases
there
miami county is 117 per 100 000
residents in the last two weeks and then
we'll go up
northwest ohio again clear up to wood
county
during the past two weeks they've had
144 positive cases
bowling green state university has a
newly developed cova dashboard so you
can take a look at that
that reports that bowling green had 62
cases bowling green state university 62
cases from september 1 to september 8th
and that's the numbers speaking of
wittenberg
we're going to ask the president of
wittenberg to come on here
dr franson um doctor thank you very very
much for
uh joining us uh you have a a beautiful
lovely campus
and uh with with great students and
faculty and uh
we want to just kind of find out how
things are going for you
and what what you're seeing and and how
you're dealing with everything
well thank you very much governor for uh
giving me a chance to share our story
as the governor indicated our dashboard
is available
at our website uh wittenberg dot edu
slash together is where our covet
information is and
and together is really the description
of
how we've approached this as a community
how we plan to bring students back to
campus
and the fact that we've just had great
cooperation in springfield
from the clark county combined health
district and mercy hospital both
we saw our case numbers increase from
two one of which was resolved last
monday
to 22. and we're doing our own contact
tracing
uh we're finding that because of our
tight-knit community
our staff who are doing the contact
tracing can
can quickly make connections and and get
students to talk to them because they're
comfortable
and familiar and we have a daily meeting
with our
combined health district and the
physicians that have been advising us
and one of the things that that really
worried uh the health district in
particular
was they were finding from our reporting
uh
contact close contacts of 10 to 15
per case whereas typically they find two
to three co
close contacts per case so you know
concerned about that
we have been doing uh symptomatic
testing and
we're only able to start doing any
asymptomatic testing
middle of last week with mercy and to
get a handle on
on how our community was really doing we
we wanted to pause the in-person
instruction
and have an opportunity to test a larger
swath of our community
so we could really get a better picture
and fortunately
with help from the local health district
your office governor
we had a testing event on campus
yesterday and
uh hopefully by the end of the week
we're going to have a better sense of
where we really are
well it's interesting uh mr president
that you're doing
your own tracing that sounds like it's
working pretty well
and also interesting
i wonder if you could talk a little bit
more about the contacts because
when and maybe explain how that tracing
is done so that anybody who's watching
this doesn't
maybe understand the contacts uh but
you know it it is interesting uh it's a
pretty high number
uh of contacts per per student so
if you can kind of run through that a
little bit sure so uh
our contact tracing is being done by our
staff our our athletic trainers in
particular have really stepped up to be
involved in that
um their their workload's a little
quieter right now because we don't have
uh intercollegiate athletics going on
and we have a lot of athletes who they
know and so you know we've
activated them gotten them trained to do
that contact tracing
and you know they're they're very busy
um and what we're finding with the the
context they're reaching out to
um again it's it's social circles as the
the governor said it's not spread that's
happening in the classroom
it's not spread that's happening in the
dining hall
it's really the residence units and
uh social gatherings that are are
driving
our challenges um we have about 60
houses
adjacent to campus that anywhere from
three to five students live in
and so we're fortunate in that you know
we aren't seeing
spread in our dormitories um we're
seeing the spread in those residential
housing units
uh neighbors to neighbors
block to block um but not so much in our
our residence halls so
we've been able to quarantine people uh
on a smaller scale than we might if it
were in our dorms
and what's the plans going forward
doctor you've kind of paused
you're going remote at this point i
think you said right so we're
we're in a two-week pause with in-person
instruction we asked
students to stay on campus um as advised
by
by your office and uh dr fauci
i wish i could say all of them did some
of them went home
but the majority of them are here with
us
we're continuing to offer support
services to students
we again we've got great support from
the local health district in terms of
taking care of our
our cases and we're up to 76 active
cases as of today
um taking care of those students are who
are in quarantine making sure they get
meals
uh making sure we're checking up on them
and you know again the test results from
this broader testing are really going to
going to help us see if if the work we
were doing
had captured the majority of activity on
our campus then great
but if the tests show that even with
those efforts we were missing a lot of
what was going on on campus
we'll have to to rethink just how long
we paused the in-person instruction
we had one of your students on a skype
yesterday uh chancellor gardner and i
did and we had students from actually
all over the state
and one one of the students uh made a
kind of interesting
point uh the students said you know
what's important is there still be stuff
to do on campus because if
university is not sponsoring things to
do on campus that
is in fact safe the student's
perspective was
people will go off and do the sort of do
their own thing so that's a
you got to you got a tough balance there
you know you want to keep the
social distance and keep people wearing
masks but it was a
it was interesting i hadn't really
thought about that and i don't know if
you
have any reaction to that uh or or or
not but it was
i found to be an interesting comment yep
and and you know we recognized that
uh from last spring that engagement was
going to be really important and
last spring as we went to all remote
instruction
you know staying engaged with our
students virtually and and otherwise
keeping faculty and staff engaged and as
we brought students back to campus this
fall
you know having opportunities for them
to engage
that were structured and safe uh was
really important to us
and you know we've had a couple of
pornhole tournaments which are uh you
know good way to get people together but
keep them
distanced we've had
some uh car races we brought in a
company that that
did car races on the uh the main uh
uh quad in our on our campus um
and we've tried to to do what we can to
create
structured activities safe activities we
also have uh have had a bunch
of uh pickup and take-home
craft projects that seem to be a hit
with students and we've
just this week had a pick up and take
home cooking project
our students who are in those houses
have their own kitchens
and so you know we're doing uh what we
can
we can't do that 24 7. we have to rely
on the students
to mask up what we say at wittenberg is
stay a tiger apart
tiger's a little bit bigger than six
feet so we we ask him to stay a tiger
apart
and you know practice good hygiene and
and really limit gatherings and you know
what we're hearing from
the health district is the distancing
and masking and duration
of whatever contact they have are just
so important
and you know i think we're going to
redouble the efforts to make sure
students understand that i think they've
learned a lot about how important that
is just from our experience over the
last 10 days
dr franson thank you and good luck to
you and students at wittenberg and the
faculty
and and all your team and uh i've said
this before
but uh when you see a university or
college uh that is reporting cases
um it really means that they're doing
something right they're on it
uh they're trying they're trying to do
the tracing uh they're doing the testing
and they're doing what they need to do
and the same is true had the opportunity
to talk to the superintendent
in in lima uh yesterday um
and uh k through 12. and um you know
it's just good to talk to some of the
superintendents because uh
you know they're on it and um you know
as dr franson said what i think we're
finding both in k-12
uh and in our colleges is that the
classroom
while there certainly can always be
spread we're not saying there can't be
but that's usually a pretty safe place
and what we're seeing is
either spread out into the community uh
or in the case with college students
them doing something
um you know that's that's it's not in
the dorm it's not in
not in the class but uh so those are
things that we have to have to be
concerned about again doctor thank you
we appreciate it
thank you appreciate your leadership on
this appreciate uh
chancellor gardner's uh support for all
of the higher ed institutions in the
state
we appreciate it thanks doctor this
morning i was reading
cleveland.com and came across a story
which
made me feel really good um and i want
to kind of share it
um it goes back to something that we
started uh
when i was uh attorney general in 2011.
uh when we learned that there were
thousands of old uh forgotten
rape kits gathering dust
these kits spanning from 1971 to 2014
had never been tested for whatever
reason for dna
um that today with what we can do today
is just unacceptable
i asked law enforcement agencies to send
old kits
into into bci the state crime lab
which is a division of the attorney
general's office we received over 14 000
previously untested jets we test each
and every one of them each kit
representing
a sexual assault survivor
majority of the kits or at least a good
number of the kits the most number were
from cleveland
yesterday county prosecuting attorney
michael o'malley announced that his
office has now indicted more than
800 people through the work of their
sexual assault kit
task force which was initially formed in
2013 by then prosecutor tim mcginty so
we want to thank
prosecutor o'malley prosecutor mcginty
and their team the men and women of
their team who have worked so very very
hard as well as the people from bci
who have been involved in this this is
truly an
amazing amazing feat ohio really
leads the nation in this and something
that we all should be very very proud of
we changed i think by doing this we
changed the culture
or helped advance the culture at least
in ohio and across the country
and said look we're not going to accept
the fact that these are
old rape kits they have not been tested
we're not going to accept the fact
that these may be difficult cases to run
down uh
and so great work bci great work
our current attorney general dave yost
um
this has just been a real real team
effort uh it's something that ohioans i

victims as i have

be done

message is

leadership that we need let me turn it
over now
to the lieutenant governor john
thank you governor a couple of issues as
it relates to the economy today
and i'll start with the census and you
may be asking
what's the census have to do the with
the economy well
this once in a decade count will
determine how 1.5 trillion
dollars in federal funding is allocated
to states
counties and cities to a sport support
essential services
like public education and public health
and
also as i think many of you know it
determines
how many congressional districts we have
how much representation we have in the
federal government
at the congressional level and as of
today
uh 69.5 percent of all ohioans have
returned uh their their completed their
census form and that
has us above the national rate at 65.5
but we're a step a little bit behind
about a point behind michigan so some of
our
our other states are you know around us
or
that we compete with are are in the
ballpark are a little ahead of us
and the deadline is about three weeks
away um
and and so we need we need your help
we need you to fill out your census
uh information takes about 10 minutes
it has 10 years of impact if you do it
and
i will just say if you want to find this
go to
2020census.gov
2020census.gov or call
1-844-330-2020 and so
for those of you watching out there
please share that message for those of
you in the media please
help us out please uh help remind folks
that we need to get this done
that much you know a great deal funding
that we will allocate to schools and
local officials
comes as a result of of how we are
accounting for ourselves in the census
another piece of economic information a
little bit of good news
unemployment initial unemployment or
jobless claims
fell last week
that the initial uh we dropped by four
percent which is good
um and uh there were 11
442 fewer claims uh
filed uh continuing claims filed then
the previous week
if you add this all up that means that
12
178 fewer people were seeking
unemployment in ohio
all good news we're continuing to move
things in the right direction
albeit not as quickly as as i know we
wish
but one of the ways that we can step up
the pace a little bit if you're out
there and you're struggling and you're
looking for a job
go to ohio means jobs there are
presently over a hundred and fifty
thousand jobs available at ohio means
jobs dot com
more than seventy thousand of those pay
fifty thousand dollars more
a year so a a robust uh resource for you
as we continue to to
move forward with the economic recovery
it's one of the ways that we can help
each other and and help ourselves
and then a business spotlight we've
talked about some of the people that
have chipped in
along the way i referenced root
insurance on tuesday i would like to
talk about a manufacturing company cam
manufacturing in van word ohio up
up off of route 127 where i used to
travel on my way home
when i was traveling to northwest ohio
and they typically produce
handbags co-they cut and sew products
but they had some ups and downs during
the
the pandemic and they temporarily shut
down
but they rebounded
with the production of ppe and
cam was able to retain their 29
employees and added 15 more
and they produced already produced over
sixty thousand disposable isolation
gowns
fifteen thousand reusable isolation
gowns
uh close to seventy five thousand masks
and about 25 000 n95 masks all of these
things
important and making sure we have
adequate ppe
and we know we don't want to rely on a
international supply chain we want to
build a domestic supply chain for this
also for the long run and so what cam
manufacturing is doing is a is worth
highlighting
and just everyone remember this there
are a lot of businesses in ohio that are
stepping up to help all of us
and we need to support them support your
local businesses
whether that's your restaurants your
stores whatever it is
these are your friends and neighbors
they're part of your community
support those businesses so that we can
get this economic recovery moving even
faster
thanks governor
uh we were going to hear from laurie
chris i just want to say that
today is world suicide prevention day
um and i know if laurie is laurie's
still on there
eric uh lori uh
you want to just talk to us a little bit
i know this has been very very tough
uh for people and i hear hear it all the
time i heard from college students
yesterday uh about
you know how difficult this six months
has been
i heard it from young people yesterday
college age
but i know it affects everyone so i
don't know lori if you can give us
any kind of advice lori's been on here
before if you recall
she is member of our cabinet ohio
departmental health and addiction
services
director uh lori chris lori good
afternoon governor
thanks uh for giving us a chance to talk
about mental health again
today and and it is world suicide
prevention
day today so it's an important day for
us to think about uh not just our mental
wellness but
what actions we can take as ohioans to
prevent suicide so
just quickly um you know these are
really stressful times
and people are are definitely feeling it
and the message we want people to know
is it is okay to not feel okay
but you also don't have to feel alone i
know you talked the other day about some
some things that all of us can do to
check in on each other
whether that's a phone call or a text or
meeting at a restaurant or a coffee shop
for a socially distanced
meal together a handwritten card those
are things
all of us can be doing to take care of
ourselves
but it's also important that each of us
know and understand the risk
factors and the signs of suicide so on
this
world suicide prevention today really
want to highlight that
if if you have a loved one a friend who
is
talking about feeling hopeless or
like they're a burden to others or they
really don't have a reason to live
that's something to pay close attention
to if you see
them using drugs or alcohol
and taking real risks and and having
risky behaviors like driving
in risky ways or drinking to
intoxication
those are things that acting recklessly
visiting or calling people to say
goodbye
or giving away prized possessions
to people those are all signs that
someone might be thinking
about suicide and then also just
withdrawing from family and friends
disconnecting not spending that time
that they normally would interacting
with people
it can be uncomfortable to talk to
someone about suicide
or to talk about mental health in
general and that's normal but just
remember
talking about mental health doesn't have
to be a big deal you can
just ask how someone's feeling and be a
good listener
talking about suicide does not mean that
you're putting the idea of suicide in
someone's mind it doesn't make them
think about it
if they already weren't and so just
talking about it
making it a conversation that's safe to
have is a good thing to do
and also remembering that suicidal
feelings are temporary and so having
that conversation
checking in on someone is an important
way that we can each
take a step to save a life remind the
person they're not alone
and know that you're not alone either
there are ways that all of us can
connect to professionals for advice
and for help and for counseling and for
crisis support
so just a couple of quick ways that we
can do that as ohioans
first we have the crisis text line so
you can see that up here it's
text the number four and the word hope
to 741
741 and within minutes you can start a
text conversation
with a professional counselor who will
help
walk through some of the emotional
distress you're feeling and help connect
you
to the information or support that you
need
you can also call the ohio care line
this is something that we started in
april
it's a person on the other end of the
phone 24 hours a day
seven days a week and it gives every
ohioan a free
confidential way to just reach out and
get questions answered ask for help
we've already had nearly 2500 ohioans
use this care line
about 50 percent of them have gotten
information
or referral to support in their local
communities about 30 percent of them
have actually had a brief counseling
opportunity while they were on the phone
less than 10 minutes but just some
advice
and some opportunity to to ease that
emotional distress
and nearly 150 ohioans use this line as
a way to get connected to crisis
services
because they uh were really seeking that
out when they made that call
so we want you to use this the number is
1-800-720-9616 and again it's free
it's confidential it's 24 hours a day
for any ohioan any age to call and ask
for help
suicide is something that occurs at
every age for ohioans men are four times
more likely to attempt or complete a
suicide and that's men of all ages so
really thinking 35 and older even older
adults
so pay attention to one another and
ask how people are doing reach out for
help and connect to these resources
suicide is preventable there's hope
and together we can prevent suicides in
ohio
director thank you thank you very much
very very helpful
appreciate it thanks for good work and
your department's work
uh we'll go now to questions
first question today is from jeff
freddick at wsyx in columbus
good afternoon governor jeff
the data for franklin county is
interesting today the cases as you know
continue to march
very upward now over 158 per 100 000
at the same time hospitalizations
continue to go down
deaths continue to go down that's even
as we're
poised to hit a higher peak than we've
ever hit here in franklin county and in
columbus so
at some point knowing that young people
are driving this
does anything become more targeted based
on age group rather than
mass orders for everyone you know
restrictions for every restaurant
do we do we have a realization that
young people are driving this and
they're just not getting as sick
well i think that's that's true it's
particularly uh true in a
county that's a young county uh
based on population uh it's a city uh
columbus is a young city
um you know obviously driven by our
universities
um so that should not surprise the
numbers i showed up here were statewide
numbers but
as you could see uh you know huge number
uh between 0 and 30
but you know big big number between 18
and and
and 30. uh so no that it should not
surprise us that you know the
the concern uh we have a lot of concerns
um you know it's like it's not as if
a young people young person can't get
sick
you know we saw some hospitalization
numbers up there
so people can get sick at any age they
can end up going to the hospital
they certainly it's less uh when you're
18 or
20. but we've also had examples of
people get very very very sick
the second point though is the spread
and this is why when we look at our
colleges and universities and it's why
the white house
uh experts are saying you know once you
start back in college don't send the
students home
uh because all you're doing is then you
know taking that spread and
sending it out to whoever they they came
from and you may hit other vulnerable
populations so i think
you know a big concern is other
vulnerable populations
uh and that 20 year old can have it and
maybe not have uh
you know not have any symptoms but then
somebody else gets it
uh from from them so it's kind of the
rebound effect
uh i made that up but it's you know sort
of a
bounce off effect uh and that's you know
really what you're concerned about
um you know your question is can you
target this group anymore yeah i mean
that's the question that we ask
ourselves and we're looking for
you know we're looking looking for ideas
and certainly ways to do that
next question is from jackie borchardt
at the cincinnati enquirer
good afternoon governor experts keep
saying that if we really want to slow
down the spread we need to be able to
test frequently and quickly
it's been more than a month since that
six state compact to acquire antigen
tests was announced
i know the feds are sending antigen
tests in nursing homes and assisted
living centers
is ohio moving forward to acquire
antigen tests
and use them what is the plan at this
point
well we're exploring a lot of different
things
uh i can give you next time a full
report of all the different things that
that are uh we are looking at and the
process
that we're in as you know one of the big
announcements was from the white house
uh a huge number uh you know we're gonna
find out in the next couple days we
think
when all those are coming uh those are
those are
quicker tests uh less invasive tests and
you know we're gonna make decisions
about where to deploy those
um you know when you look at uh you know
where to deploy them you look at your
your most vulnerable populations uh
first of all where your deaths are
occurring
or where you know the majority of deaths
are occurring you look at nursing homes
other congregate care
settings um you'd also look at your
universities you'd look at
schools so um you know all those things
are coming but i will come out i will on
tuesday
going to give you a a report we may have
one of our
testing experts that we have kind of
walk everybody through
exactly jackie where we are with all the
different
all the different testing i was on the
phone with our testing team
team this morning i'm on the phone with
them uh about every day but
they're better able to give you a more
precise and accurate where we are with
with every level of that
so we'll do that we'll try to do that on
tuesday thanks do you have an update
from my tuesday question about the
school order what was the question
well the order uh makes it optional for
schools to
do any sort of public reporting like a
dashboard you mentioned the college
dashboard several times today
and how useful they are but in the state
health order for
k-12 schools that is uh something they
are encouraged to do
but not required to do so why my
question from tuesday was
why not make that a requirement yeah i
mean i look i've talked to
superintendents uh in the last several
days who are concerned that we're
disclosing too much
information uh and then it might be too
burdensome so we're trying to get we're
trying to get a sweet spot there
i think it's great when schools set up
a place where anybody can go at any time
and look and see
you know what exactly is going on in
that school
but we're trying to get this right we
think we've got the right order but
frankly
we're going to see how this works out
we're going to wait another few days and
re-evaluate it until we
as i said we have some people say well
you know you're putting out too much
information some people said
you know it's too burdensome to put all
this information out what we thought was
the most important thing is that
if you have a child in that school and
that child came in contact with the
person who
has coveted you need to know that
obviously the normal
tracing the health department needs to
know that that report needs to be made
we think it's also important that that
school disclose
uh if there is covet in that in in in
that building
and if there's covet in that in that
school system so you know
they are to make those disclosures
um some of them have decided to do it
uh through a dashboard and again that we
think is a
is a pretty good way to do it so
we're in a trial period we're gonna see
how this works we're gonna see if
you know information is flowing but
again
i know that in the news media you want
to get all this and i fully understand
that
uh most important people that get it are
the parents and the parents who have
kids in that school
and our order make sure that the parents
who have kids in that school
know about that and know what's know
what's going on
one thing that's been expressed to me is
look it makes our school look bad
and let me just say again schools that
are reporting
covet uh should not be considered
as being bad schools or not doing their
job
it means they are doing their job
they're finding the cova they're
reporting it
uh they're tracing they're turning it
over to the health department they're
doing what needs to be done
that's true with our colleges and that's
true with k-12 as well
thank you next question is from jack
windsor at wmfd in mansfield
governor hello uh first thank you for
taking the time today to distinguish the
difference between
deaths reported and actual deaths that
occurred in the past 24 hours as well as
the scale on the graph regarding
hospitalizations by age we've already
received a lot of messages and our
viewers appreciate that so thank you
um governor my question is regarding the
new york times article
i think you've heard about this before
it published on august 29th and it
referenced
testing data gathered from massachusetts
new york and nevada
that found up to 90 of positive tests
are picking up
dead virus fragments that the cdc says
could be up to 12 weeks old
that would mean that instead of maybe 15
to 20 000 active cases in ohio we may
actually be around
say 1500 to 2 2000 do you have plans or
should we have
plans to start tracking viral load data
as a better determinant and is it
possible that we might otherwise be
quarantining thousands
of ohioans and college students based on
the older science and testing
and then a follow-up where are we with
the antibody testing study dr
acton promised back in april thank you
yeah the antibody test i'll let john
talk about that because
uh he's he has looked at that uh we got
preliminary results back we've not
gotten uh final results back yet so when
we get the final we will
we will certainly uh certainly uh
release those uh
jack interesting question um i don't
know about the
new york times story in those uh those
states
but um you know
if you had perfectly precise measurement
uh you might be able to and again i'll
leave it up to the doctors but you
you would have a better idea of exactly
when someone
is contagious um
you know the the pcr and i think i said
this on
tuesday pcr test is is
is very accurate but you know it may be
still picking up
the viral you know well after that
person is
contagious and so as we get more tests
and we get the better ability to
to do that you know what everyone would
love to have
is knowing exactly when that person is
contagious
and if there's a way to know when
exactly they're no longer contagious and
that way you could confine them or
or separate them from people only during
during that during that period
that period of time but i've asked my
team and we can talk about it on tuesday
i've asked my team to come up with
you know exactly where the state of the
art is uh
in trying to get that in trying to get
that viral that viral load
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
hey governor um given
that the symptoms of the flu in covid19
can sometimes be pretty similar um i
suppose if more people
get the flu vaccine this year will that
in any way help us avoid some of the
lockdowns that we had to go through
earlier this year you think
well i i think that's a good it's look
it's a good point i mean it's going to
enable
um you know again i'm not the doctor
but you know we know a couple things
uh or i've been told a couple of things
one
you don't want to have the flu and covet
i mean you don't want to have either one
but you certainly do not want to have
them
excuse me both the same time uh
and the other thing is we know that what
these shots do that fran i just got and
john got
uh you know you may still get it but you
don't get it
with as bad as symptoms um so
the other thing that's going on and we
don't know how it's going to play out
but it's
you know it's it's it's something to
wonder about
uh is there have been some countries in
in the southern hemisphere
uh that have not had as bad a flu season
uh and that is attributed at least in
the articles i read to
people wearing mass and because the good
news is and we actually
dr acting and i started talking about
this early early on six months ago
but the good news is what you do to
protect yourself from flu is very
similar to what you would do to protect
yourself with covet
so it's not a new message it's not a new
drill uh you know
by and so you know what happened they
think in this
southern hemisphere is it was a much
milder flu season
uh because people were wearing masks and
were doing
all the all the things the washing of
the hands etc so
um it's a positive thing to get the flu
shot
you know and i think there's a number of
reasons why
next question is from jake zuckerman at
the ohio capitol journal
hi governor in interviews in february
and march
with bob woodward of the washington post
president donald trump
uh talked about how deadly the
coronavirus is and called it more
deadly than the flu he said in these
interviews
i wanted to i wanted to always play it
down i still like playing it down
because i don't want to create a panic
and in public he referred to the virus
as a democrat hoax
said it would go away on its own and
compared it to the flu
do you believe the president misled the
public about the gravity of
public of coven 19 well first of all
look bob woodward is a respected
journalist
um uh you know has great great
uh credibility um
all i can do is is you know talk about
our communication
with the white house and uh you know
what what they were doing uh the
president made decisions
or some decisions early on um
to you know stop travel uh for for
example um
so um you know those were decisions that
that he made um all i know is what
i saw on tv last night in the brief time
i was watching uh
president said you know he did not want
to alarm people
so i'm going to take the president uh at
face value
uh look our our relationships
what we do every week um with the white
house we had a call
yesterday uh usually the vice president
is on the call
sometimes the president is on the call
uh and if you could see those or you
could listen to those
um they're very very business like no
nonsense
uh straightforward let's get the job
done uh that has been my
um relationship with this administration
uh when we've asked them when i called
the president on a sunday morning
he called me back and said you know can
we move forward on this
a little quicker but whatever we've
asked them to do they have tried to do
they haven't been able to do everything
uh but they have tried to do and they've
taken this
uh very very seriously uh you know all
the way through
and so that's been my personal
relationship or my personal experience
you know that i have had
next question is from alex ebert at
bloomberg
good afternoon governor thanks for
having us following up on that last
question
the governor to the north in a state i
will not name
said today during a press conference
that the greatest threat to america
is actually the disinformation that
president trump has given to the
american people
about the virus since february in those
interviews
like the previous questionnaire um posed
he indicates that he is downplaying the
viruses potential
he's called it a fraud he's called it a
hoax since then
how has that impacted the people of ohio
thank you
well look i'll let people make their own
judgment on that my focus has been on
ohio
um you know i have been uh
i've been accused of uh uh you know
gloom and doom and uh
and and and too many facts and too much
uh
uh uh you know i've been accused as an
alarmist
so look i mean you just have to call it
like you see it uh
i've tried to call it like i see it uh
in ohio i tried to keep ohioans informed
of what we know uh you know we continue
to learn from the virus
and i think we should we should keep
that in mind uh you know hindsight is
always great
whether whoever whatever governor you're
looking at or whatever
president you're looking at you know
hindsight is great
uh but this virus continues to evolve
and the understanding continues to
evolve
i mean this has been pointed out to me
many many times but it's true
early on if you talk to the cdc and the
experts you know they would tell us
something about that mask
well you know don't wear a mask
you know well it's abundantly clear now
after doing this for six months and
after you know some research being done
and observations and cases followed that
masks are huge
and so you know what we have tried to do
what i've tried to do
is your governor uh is to
give you the facts as i know them um
and but you know hindsight is always
great
if we knew what we know today when the
when this whole thing started uh you
know we would have done things different
probably in ohio too
uh but but we we did not so we're trying
to
call it like we see it we're going to
continue to do that and sometimes people
don't like it but
you know i think that's what i owe the
people of ohio
governor i just wanted to respond on
on the antibody testing the promise has
always been that it would be here
sometime by the
final report would be issued by the
middle of september we're still on track
with that
so maybe by next thursday or the
following tuesday we should have that
report
available for presentation great
thank you next question is from adrian
robbins at wcmh
in columbus hi governor thank you for
being here
as we get closer and closer to senior
center's reopening we're getting quite a
few of the recreational senior centers
that are a little confused on whether or
not they need to follow the guidelines
except for adult day cares and longer
term senior centers especially
if they have to do covent testing for
all participants and employees would you
be able to clarify that policy a little
bit
yeah we'll have uh racell on
director mcelroy on next week
and she can kind of run down that she's
been working on
on on both of those and she can kind of
outline exactly how we
we hope to do this um you know we we
realize that our senior centers are very
uh very very important uh but we also
realize that we
this virus has not gone away and so we
have to have people who can keep their
distance our senior senators
many of them have still been supplying
services
uh the services just have been cut down
or they've been you know out away from
the from the building itself and you've
seen a lot fewer people who have been
able to
to actually come into the to the senior
centers but this is important for mental
health uh it's important for
for many many reasons and i'll have
director mcelroy
uh skype in uh next week and she can
kind of lay out exactly where
where we are and where we think we're
going it would be an appropriate time to
do that
next question is from justin dennis at
mahoningmatters.com
afternoon governor we've heard from some
local officials who say they must
decide how to use state disbursed karzai
funding
by october 6 and they feel that's not
enough time
they also said the state was slow to
disperse its karzak funding to
localities
you feel the state has given localities
enough time to work with this funding
and can you
explain kind of what's happening behind
the scenes in the states process for
dispersing those funds and also when can
localities
expect the next disbursement and would
it still carry that same october 6
deadline
sure sure there is a bill in the
legislature
it's passed one house we expect it to
pass the other house
uh that will get the additional money
out we have taken the attitude uh
in my administration that this money all
of it should go out
to the local communities and we have
done that
what they simply have to do is follow
whatever the federal government tells
them to do
we have tried to obm to assist them in
understanding
what the federal requirements are and
what the federal government is saying so
these are
these are my knowledge not our
restrictions uh these are
as they come down from from the federal
government you know one of the messages
that we've when we've talked to
senator portman senator brown or members
of the house
is we've always asked for more
flexibility and we've asked for more
flexibility for the local communities
to be able to you know make their own
make their determination about how
how this money should be spent so i
don't know john do you have anything
to add on that i know you've worked on
that as well as i have
john just left for another meeting okay
so but that's that's what we're doing
and uh you know we want to get this
money out i i talk
to the mayors quite often this week
yesterday had long
discussion with a large number of county
commissioners today with mayors
so we know they need the money
we want to get get them money as soon as
this bill passes the legislature
i'll sign it the rest of the money goes
out
next question is from ben schwartz at
wcpo
in cincinnati hi ben hi governor
i'm wondering if you're able to follow
up about cincinnati police
chief elliott isaac's request that you
no longer impose the 10 pm closure for
bars and restaurants
i know you've now consulted with your
lawyers and
they've determined it's impossible to
just carve cincinnati
out of that order but do you plan to or
is there a need to work with the city in
any way further to find a solution to
their problem
sure that's a good excellent question
ben
you're right uh our lawyers tell us we
cannot legally cut cincinnati out we
would do that
uh mayor's requested we do that if we
could do that just for cincinnati we
would
do that we legally cannot do that the
only other option is to
change it for the whole state we have
other mayors who are adamant and telling
me
please please don't do that
so akron dayton columbus
so we're not going to do that and
but we're certainly very open to working
with the mayor and with the chief if
there's anything else that we can do
one thing the legislature can do is to
pass our bill
that goes after violent repeat offenders
goes after people who
have no business having a gun who have
no legal right to have a gun
these are people who've been convicted
of felonies and violent offenses before
they have no right to have a gun we have
a strong federal law in this area
we have a fairly weak ohio law we need
to get the ohio law
up to where the federal law is now the
u.s attorney will take
some some of these cases these are cases
where someone is picked up they've got a
gun
maybe they don't have not at that moment
committing any other offense
but they've got a gun and they're a
convicted felon of a violent offense
but the number of cases the u.s attorney
can take are very limited
uh and so they're going to take some and
we appreciate them taking them
but i want to empower local judges local
prosecutors
local police local sheriffs uh to be
able to
uh throw the book at the guy uh
if he is in the community and he's got a
gun and he's not supposed to have a gun
what you find in these tragedies
continue day after day and every week i
i read some of the ones that have
occurred to
to everyone because it just is so
maddening
uh and you see little children who are
shot almost inevitably
almost inevitably the people who pulled
the trigger
did not have the right to have a gun we
could have picked him up before
they could be off the streets they could
be locked up
so i just asked the legislature please
help us on this
i don't know who's against this this
protects the second amendment these
people don't have a right to have a gun
anyway
so again we ask our friends in the
legislature to take action this is
something we can do
and and we've we presented the bill and
we would ask them to do that
next question is from john reed at
gangwar news service
good afternoon governor um my question
is
we're seeing these spikes in college
towns because of students coming back to
campus
how much of that is due to behavior of
students or a higher prevalence of cases
among students and how much is
we're finally getting kind of a
broad-based white population
surveillance test and we're seeing a lot
of people who are
asymptomatic well i think it's both
probably john um you know what we're
seeing is
human nature and people are getting
together and college students are
getting together and
you know experience in college for for
most people it's uh
it's a uh you know get together and
have a good time and uh you know
socialize
but um you know we we know that if
people don't do that carefully
um that that causes a significant spread
so you have
you know 10 000 15 000 sometimes
students coming into a community uh that
were not there a month ago
and in some cases they're in a fairly
concentrated area and they're
intermixing with each other
so you know it's it should not surprise
any of us that this happens and
and the burden that college presidents
carry
uh and that universities carry is to try
to convince
students look the only way you're gonna
have a year on
campus nine months on campus is if
everyone
you know tries to do what we need to do
wear masks when you're out in public
keep keep keep the distance
you're also right i think that you know
the schools that you're seeing the high
numbers are schools that
uh took it upon themselves and said hey
we gotta go test
uh if ohio state or university of dayton
uh
or if miami or wittenberg these four
schools
we just talked about recently if they
weren't testing
you probably wouldn't know much you know
we wouldn't know uh
that there are that many cases because
you know that that age group
many of them have no symptoms so i i
think
you're right on both both counts
next question is from danny eldridge at
hannah news service
hello governor um so my question is what
are your thoughts on the prospect
of ohio state suing the big ten over uh
football season being cancelled
yeah i mean look i don't know it's gonna
be up to the big ten when they vote
i talked to gene smith athletic director
this morning about it
he gave me a little a little update i
know ohio state wants to play
i know the president wants to play and i
think they make a good argument
and the argument is that because they
have the capability of testing
very frequently uh and not just
you know not just their football players
but all the athletes
and they're testing quite extensively on
campus too with everybody
but they're testing even more with with
athletes because they have that ability
um they know what they can know what's
going on uh because
there's a real incentive for athletes
who want a season who want to
want to play um and to
avoid doing stupid things uh as
as we all do uh and not wearing a mask
and
you know uh socializing uh in close
proximity to each other with a lot of
different people
but there's real incentive for them not
to do that to be careful uh
so i think that you know you could look
at these students uh these student
athletes as being
as safe as anybody on campus or maybe
more so
uh so i think there's a pretty good
argument that
you know it makes sense to to try to
have that try to have that season
next question is from andy chow at ohio
public radio and television
hi governor i wanted to talk more about
the appointment of
dr duvey i was wondering what kind of
expectations are you going to have for
her when she first starts
what things do you think might improve
with a permanent director
and are you at all worried about any
sort of pushback from
the senate when it comes to approving
the appointment
well all good questions what are my
expectations
high you know she's a she's a
a hard charger and
uh you know we're in the middle of a
pandemic uh so you know i'd love to have
her in here uh
right away but she's gotta you know give
notice and she's gotta
you know wrap up what she's doing and
that's that's only fair to south
carolina
uh i think look lance himes as acting
director has done a
very very very good job uh i think it's
always better to have a permanent
director
uh it's i think particularly good
uh with this director with her deep
knowledge her deep knowledge
of um uh of public health uh her many
many years
experience in public health um and
you know she is on just you know the
calls i'm on
uh every week uh with the vice president
and the white house team she's listening
to those calls too
in south carolina so i mean she's she's
been doing
uh you know she's been immersed in this
battle
uh just like we have been immersed in
this battle uh
as far as the confirmation look i i will
leave that up to the to the senate
uh i talked to the senate president this
morning uh larry abhoff i talked
to the speaker um bob cup
and uh just to inform them of what our
choice is
uh look she's she's worked for uh four
administrations
uh in indiana three in indiana uh one in
south carolina uh so i think she's a
known
known quality and uh you know i think
she'll be confirmed
and uh i know she'll do a good job
governor the next question is the last
question today and it belongs to jim
otty from whio in dayton
governor briefly i want to have you
address some of the frustrations that
are bouncing around the legislature
among your friends
especially those who are most
conservative their constituents who
say now that you continue to move the
goal pose since we're talking about
college football
move the goal post further and further
down the road they want to know
when are you going to remove the
remaining restrictions here is this tied
to some kind of a positivity rate
a number of cases new cases per capita
and a certain time frame here
what are your goals at this point and
when would they likely see
some of the remaining restrictions come
off
well jim look that's a good question i'm
asked that question
a lot not just by legislators when i
done a number of tv interviews as you
know over the last
few days one-on-one with anchors and and
you know veteran reporters like you and
the question
came up almost every time when you're
gonna take the mask order off this is
the
this is the question we're getting in
the newsroom many times the anchor would
would say to me so i look i know that
that's on people's minds
um
this is a fight we're in
um we can't let the virus off the floor
we got it down it's still killing people
tragically killing people every day
still people getting sick every day but
we've been able to
at least keep it smoldering and not
flaring up
if we took off for example mask
orders tomorrow it'll flare up just like
that
uh that would be a horrible disservice
to the people of the state because if
if we started making these changes
people would say well dewine must know
something do i must know that this is
this is not uh as bad as it was
look there there is as much spread out
there today as there has ever been
during this entire entire period of time
uh so it would not be you know a wise
time for us
to to let up i look at
the sacrifices that ohioans are making
uh the worrying of the mass keeping the
distance uh
being careful with parties all of these
things as a price that we pay
as ohioans for freedom
so the freedom that we can go to work
freedom we can go to a restaurant
freedom that we can go to a bar freedom
uh more importantly probably maybe then
besides going to work than anything else
freedom uh so that our kids can go to
school
so kids can go to school so we we make
those sacrifices
so kids can go to school we make those
sacrifices so we can work we make those
sacrifices
so that we can do all the other things
that we
we really want to do so look we're not
going to keep any restriction on
one second longer than it has to be on
but i am not going to stand up here and
take off
restrictions or signal to the people of
ohio that this battle is over when i
know it is not
over and there's no indication that that
it is over uh at all so thank you very
much
um well thank everybody i want to
mention uh we'll run out of time i want
to mention september 11th
uh patriot day we remember today uh and
we'll try to do this maybe a little
longer
uh next week but we remember today those
who died on september 11th we think
about them
uh when the united states was was
attacked
and we pray for them we pray for their
families
we'll see you all on tuesday
you
