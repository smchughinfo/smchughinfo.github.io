afternoon everyone
this all ohio mass was made by a friend
people are still having fun making
different masks
before we go to
today's numbers and recount exactly
where we are i want to talk for a moment
about
what is at stake and i think we know
as this virus rises and
it's really it's red tide going all the
way across
ohio that a lot of things are at stake
people's lives are at stake
we worry about our hospitals starting to
fill up
we worry about long-term damage that
people might have
from from the covet who do in fact
recover
but as i go through the statistics today
and kind of
bring you up to date about what we're
seeing today
i want to ask you to to think about
something else that is clearly at stake
and that is whether our kids can be in
school
that's really one of the things that
certainly
is at stake and it really depends on
what
we're willing to do our willingness to
to wear a mask
our willingness to keep a distance or
willingness to avoid
uh gatherings where there might be
spread or if we aren't gatherings to
to wear a mask and and to be careful
because we truly do control
the spread in the community the spread
in the community is what determines what
is going on
in in our schools
some schools because of high community
spread
have had to go remote because too many
of their kids
and teachers are out of school in the
last two weeks at least 16 districts
have made the decision to scale back to
hybrid or
fully remote models because of the
spread in their
communities other schools have had to
change their plans
for the year due to spread in their
communities just this week
for example school leaders in toledo
made the decision to keep their high
schools closed
through the end of the semester meaning
that in toledo for these students
they will have no in-person class for at
least half of this year
overall we now have at least 50
districts
that are fully online right now with
nearly 300
000 students unable to attend in-person
classes important thing i think for us
to remember is we can
we can change this uh by more of us
wearing masks
uh more of us avoiding being in
situations where there can be spread
avoiding large gatherings of people
uh just just really being careful
we can we can turn this down we can turn
this heat down
uh and we can get back to a simmer of
this
virus instead of a flame starting to
really
really come up because that flame is a
direct threat to keeping our kids
in schools i believe that it should
concern
all ohioans and it concerns me that so
many of our kids are going to school
remotely while many kids can do well
under these circumstances
many cannot some of our poorest children
who thrive in an
in-person learning environment do great
for a number of reasons maybe don't do
nearly as well remotely and it's not
just our poor children it's
many of our children throughout the
state
just do better in school
we can control this by what we do
every single day we owe it
to our children we owe it to their
future
we owe it to our state's future to fight
back
against this virus to not accept this
as something that just has to be it
doesn't have to be this way
we can control this we've done it twice
before
we've knocked this thing down early on
and then three months ago
when it was starting to spike back up we
knocked it down again
with very significant mass wearing in
those parts of the state that we're
seeing
the most spread today we're seeing
spread
virtually everywhere so eric let's take
a look
at these numbers and bring everyone up
to date on exactly where we are
today today we're reporting
2015 new cases in ohio it was not long
ago
excuse me it was not long ago that we
were a thousand cases a day and
and trending downward as we can see from
our 21
day trend chart our numbers continue to
rise at a rate that should concern
all of us we have 216 new
hospitalizations reported in the past
24 hours it's the highest number of
hospitalizations we've ever reported
and there's over 50 hospitalizations
more than the previous high
that was back in july in addition to
that we now have more people
who have cova who are in our hospitals
in hospital beds than any other time
during this pandemic the higher numbers
than ever before coming in and more
actually
in beds in hospitals today than we've
seen during this entire
pandemic tragically
we've also have eight deaths reported
since yesterday and 36 new
icu admissions eric let's go to the
top 88 counties here is the full list of
all 88 counties
by case rate per hundred thousand uh and
as you will you will see
some of the top numbers are just
staggering
uh those are four times what the cdc
says is a high incidence rate uh
so the viruses were just running rampant
in some of these top
top counties on this version of the
chart we have shaded in blue
all the counties that meet the cdc's
definition of high incidence
so if you look at that everything that
is blue is high incidence
as a reminder high incident counties are
ones with a case rate of more than 100
cases per 100 000 population in the past
two weeks
currently 69 of our 88 counties
are now considered high incidence
counties
as always these slides we posted to our
coronavirus.ohio
website if you would like to take a
closer look at the list let's move to
the top
20. we have 20 counties with the highest
case rate per 100
000 population uh during the past
couple of weeks again as we look at
these with
putting them at a at a rate that we've
never seen before
all glaze we've never really seen any
rate that high
so up at putnam you're almost five times
what the cdc
incidence is uh and as we go down
with these counties uh these are just
literally shocking numbers and i think
the thing that
we just we have to remember uh is that
these numbers will not change
unless we change unless we do things
we can change the numbers but
automatically they will they will simply
they will simply not not change
let's take a look at the data from some
of our nearby states
and what we have done is kind of done a
timeline
you can see ohio has mapped out a little
bit in here you can see our neighboring
states you can also see
illinois uh in in wisconsin
and what we wanted to do is just look at
these how they were
this is october 4th october 11th
october 18th uh as we look at these
at these sundays we can see a rather
dramatic
change and what you're seeing is there
is certainly a change
all throughout the region and you can
see how
how this is changing
these maps show the case rate per
hundred thousand population by county
over the past few weeks
the counties in green and yellow have
relatively low case rates while the
counties in orange and red have higher
case rates
as we see for the past three weeks cases
have been increased throughout the
midwest
three sundays ago we saw a lot of
counties at a very high
case level in wisconsin but the wet
rest rest of the midwest does not
look nearly so bad as we look at two
sundays ago though we could see more
counties move into the orange level
and then trends continue into this past
sunday
while we do know that there's some
spread from neighboring states
there certainly is also significant
spread among counties
between counties as residents move
move about but i just thought that was
that was kind of interesting just to see
how this is
how this is is in fact moving
we know that our small businesses have
really been
hurt uh throughout this pandemic
many of them have closed uh many of them
have just
are hanging on uh and they've virtually
all of them
have been hurt in the next week or so
we'll be announcing steps
uh to try to help these businesses i
want to
announce today that the checks that we
announced on august 20th
we'll go back to august 20th where i
asked the bureau of workers compensation
board of directors to approve
a second dividend for public and private
employers
as financial support during the ongoing
pandemic
we felt that bwc could do this and stay
fiscally
solvent and well we also felt that
businesses
needed this the board approved this
request
on september 25th those checks will be
mailed to employers
beginning i believe on friday
the final dividend amount will be
approximately 1.3
billion dollars 1.3 billion dollars that
will be going out
in checks starting on friday
to businesses throughout the state of
ohio
distributions such as these are possible
because of the strong investment returns
on employer premiums
declining number of claims each year in
prudent fiscal management so our
companies are doing well
bwc has been run very very well
and is doing a very good job these
checks will be mailed
starting as i say at the end of the week
and they will be mailed out through
through the end of october so
if you see a check uh an envelope come
in the mail
like this please please open it and see
we hope you'll see your check um
sometimes in the past
bwc tells me when these checks have gone
out some have simply gone uncached
so you know you want to make sure you
get your check you open it up in
the envelope and see the check the check
inside
also later this week we'll also be
announcing programs
to help small business and help others
that we use cares act funding i've been
talking with the speaker and with the
senate president
about this we're working with them
and the development services agency tsa
to create a wide-ranging program to
address
the needs of some of our struggling
ohioans this would include funding for
rent
mortgages water and sewer utility bills
as well as funding for small businesses
and non-profits again
we're looking towards the end of the
week to make that
joint announcement with the legislative
leaders
i want to share
something that the white house sent us
this week
as they analyzed based on their data
what was going on
in every state our letter obviously
pertains to ohio
and i just want to want to quote
something that they wrote in there
because as i looked at last night it
struck me as
something that i thought i should share
with all of you this is from
the trump administration we continue to
see community spread initiated by social
friends and family gatherings
people must remember that seemingly
uninfected family members
and friends may be infected and may not
have symptoms
exposure to those who don't have
symptoms and that exposure to that
asymptomatic spread can easily lead to
spread as people unmask
in private gatherings
the task force that sent us this white
house task force recommended that
ohioans limit friend and family get
togethers
to prevent situations where the virus
can rapidly spread and reach those most
at risk of complications
it's the same thing that i hear when i
talk to
county health commissioners uh around
the state and when they tell me
where we're seeing the spread and that
is where we're really seeing most
most of the spread
we're all excited beginning of ohio
state football
season and it's a big
10 starts back up uh brown's friends
bagel fans
just just a word a word of caution for
all of us and that is as we
get together to watch football just be
careful
you know if you're not in your direct
family um
and you're socializing uh you know
keep a mask on and just just be careful
um we feel that the teams
uh for example the bengals and the
browns are doing a good job
in the 12 000 fans that they have uh in
their stadium
uh and we've seen them do a good job in
the past
what we're really concerned about is
just all of us as we get together and
watch it on tv
so please please be careful
i want to talk a little bit about
the vaccine that will be will be coming
we this week submit ohio's interim draft
covet 19 vaccine plan to the centers
for disease control and prevention this
is a framework of how decisions will be
made when we know more about the vaccine
and will provide us a way forward as the
next chapter
of the pandemic unfolds this draft will
be available to the public tomorrow
on the cobia 19 website at
coronavirus.ohio.gov
if you want to take a look at that
this week we'll also be taking another
step in this fight against covet by
launching a new registration tool for
health care providers who would like
to eventually administer the kova 19
vaccine this proactive move allows us to
better
be prepared and respond quickly once a
vaccine is available
providers this would be health
departments hospitals
pharmacies nursing facilities
these would all be people that in
organizations that we would anticipate
would be
directly involved in the distribution
the giving of shots
when the vaccine is available they
should all
register when this goes up online
this week also something that's
going up online today that we are
announcing that our long-term care
facility dashboard is going live
this dashboard part of the covet 19
dashboard on coronavirus.ohio.gov
is another tool to help ohioans keep
informed
nursing facilities were permitted to
allow indoor visitation beginning
october 12th and we hope
that they have done that this tool
breaks down the types of visitation
facilities are allowing across the state
so you'll be able to go
online and check your county if you've
got a
loved one in a nursing home you can see
what the status is of visitation with
that nursing home so this is more
transparency
it's an effective we hope is an
effective tool to to help you
as we move move forward
let me talk briefly uh about um a flu
update
um this fall we know we'll be fighting
flu and covet both
we know that someone can have both and
that
the experts tell us that certainly is
something that we all want to
avoid uh some symptoms of the flu and
covet are similar
uh and sometimes it may be hard to tell
the difference between them based on
symptoms alone
some distinguishing symptoms of covid
i'm told by the doctors include
shortness of breath loss of taste or
smell with flu however
nasal congestion and runny nose are more
common
if you become ill this season many
health care providers will test for both
flu
and coed to get a proper diagnosis
further while the symptoms can be
similar copay 19 is
obviously more serious coping 19
symptoms last longer those hospitalized
tend to have longer hospital stays and
the virus
has a higher mortality rate i want to
especially encourage
our young people who may not be thinking
about getting a flu shot
to get one we know everyone should get
one
certainly the the elderly should get one
uh
uh very very young children uh
should get one uh but sometimes uh those
teenagers and those in in college years
uh
or maybe just out working at 22 23
years of age sometimes think that they
should not get one we would encourage
them to get one
as well you can get flu shot your
doctor's office you can get a retail
pharmacies
urgent care clinic student health
centers in addition many providers and
local health departments are offering
drive-through and curbside
flu clinics for example recently perry
county had a half day drive
through drive through flu clinic they
had 370 people
almost as many as the 400 who were
vaccinated in a full day
in a full day in 2019 harrison county
doubled the number of people vaccinated
over last year
at a recent drive-through clinic union
county combined their typical
city and county employee vaccination
event with a drive-through clinic
vaccinating more than 350 people in a
day's time
washington county tripled the number
that they had had before
so these are all encouraging encouraging
things
your health departments are going to be
very aggressive you can obviously also
get the
flu shot at your doctor you can get it
pharmacies and so we just
encourage people to do that
we talked earlier about sadly a
record-setting day on days in regard to
hospitalizations and so i thought it
would be good
uh to bring in someone who you've heard
from before
and someone who really
is involved not just in what is going on
in
in columbus wexner medical center
but he is directly involved in the
system that we have set up
statewide so we have divided the state
early on this pandemic into three
different zones
and we some of the lead hospitals take
the lead
and work with the other hospitals and i
know
let me just introduce dr andy thomas
dr thomas thanks for being back with us
we we appreciate it very very much
i know you and i were talking uh before
we went on the air you're on the phone
with um these smaller hospitals i know
several times a week and you're on the
you're on the phone
a lot with the hospitals in your zone uh
your particular zone as well so
just tell us kind of what's going on
with our hospitals we know we're seeing
this hospitalization go up we don't like
to see it but
what's the status of our hospitals
around the state
uh thank you governor thanks to for
having me here today
uh so in terms of what we're seeing with
hospital um a census for uh for covet
patients we are certainly
at the highest point that we've seen
across the state at any time during the
pandemic in terms of total
hospitalizations
uh here in zone 2 we are
at our highest rates since back in early
may
zone 3 is actually at the highest rate
that it's been at any time during the
pandemic andy
remind everybody what zone two is was
where this
the three zones are happy to zone one uh
spreads
uh from the northern uh west part of the
state through
uh cleveland youngstown akron canton
area and bob wiley who's the chief
clinical officer at cleveland clinic
leads zone one
zone two uh is regions four seven and
eight
region four spreads up 33 northwest of
columbus
down through what we would call the
central ohio contiguous counties to
franklin county
then essentially everything 23 south 33
south and 70 east at southeast quadrant
of the state
and then zone three are regions three
and six which are essentially the dayton
metropolitan area and everything to the
west and then the cincinnati and
southwestern
part of the state rick lofgren from uc
health
is the lead for zone three so what we do
as zone leads uh
to your point uh governor two days a
week i'm on the phone with local public
health folks here in columbus as well as
the
lead clinicians for large group
practices here in columbus and the
columbus hospitals
three days a week we're actually on a
call for all of the hospitals in the
zone that have coveted patients in the
hospital
once again talking about their capacity
talking about the volume of patients
making sure that we're coordinating
things well around the zone
in fact just yesterday at noon we stood
back
up our regional transfer center here for
zone two so that any hospital in the
zone that needs to move a patient to
columbus
either because they have too many
coveted patients to manage
in their hospital or a patient is too
ill to be in their local community
hospital and needs kind of a higher
level of care
any of those hospitals in the zone can
call and essentially get a centralized
call center
so that we can make sure the patient is
going to the right place at the right
time
to move between between hospitals also
in terms of clinical
updates two fridays ago we had 130
infectious disease emergency department
critical care and hospital medicine
physicians plus pharmacists and nursing
leaders
from all the zone hospitals on the phone
talking about the latest treatment
protocols
for covet 19. so we did that a number of
times over the summer related to
remdesseviere
and this conversation uh covered both
remdesvir as well as convalescent plasma
steroids and a variety of other
treatment protocols so the zone leads in
zone one and zone three have similar
cadence of uh meetings with the
hospitals and providing that sort of
support
uh for physicians at the local level uh
so that they don't feel like they're out
at the end of a limb
that's great so i interrupted you a few
minutes ago
i asked you to kind of define the zones
uh
go back and tell us again you know let's
start with northeast north or
northern tier of ohio uh what are we
seeing in that
in that zone what do we see in the other
two zones sure well
the numbers are up in in every zone
compared to earlier
uh in the summer certainly we all saw a
peak in the spring and then another peak
in
in that late july early august uh time
frame but zone three is the one
that is actually at the highest point at
all uh during the the pandemic and in
zone
uh one and two are certainly higher than
we've been now for about two
two and a half months so the total
number is certainly higher than we've
had at any time during the pandemic but
i think what's really important
is to talk about the distribution of
those patients so regions seven and
eight
in my zone are the rural areas of the
state where you have smaller hospitals
in their local communities
and actually part of our strategy is to
make sure patients that may
be you know ill enough to be in the
hospital but not ill enough to need a
high level of critical care or or
high-end uh
treatment that may not be available at
those hospitals we want to try and keep
as many patients locally as possible
so those regions maybe saw 10 15 20
patients in the past might be at 30 to
50 patients now
uh so we're doing our best to support
those local hospitals there's excellent
doctors nurses pharmacists working in
those hospitals and if it
if they are capable of taking care of
patients we want them to stay as close
to home as as possible
but when you look at the distribution of
where patients are coming from across
the state that need admitted to the
hospital it's very different than
that april may time period where it was
mainly patients from the metropolitan
uh areas of the state and some of the
suburban areas around the big cities
uh where hospitalizations occurred i
think one other major difference now
is the number of odrc inmates that need
to be in the hospital we're seeing
far better uh numbers in terms of the
number of
inmates that need to be admitted the
system for the state has done an
excellent job once again of trying to
take care of
anyone who does uh become sick at their
local facility
uh but obviously we're here as a backup
as a hospital for any of those uh
inmates that need admitted so
i think those are probably the biggest
differences is in the distribution
of the patients this time around as well
as just the overall numbers
so more more coming from the rural areas
more
more coming from a larger area of ohio
going into the hospitals
yes correct and we're now at uh we're
now at a high
but uh you know you know i've talked
you're not alarmed at this point
don't tell us kind of the level of
concern that we should have because i
get
i get asked that question so i figured
i'd put the expert on
understand thank you sir understood i
completely understand the question we've
been having this discussion on all of
our
local and zone calls for the past two
weeks because we've seen these numbers
start to trend up a few weeks ago
uh and and all of the hospital
executives and administrative and
clinical leadership that we talked to
feel that
at this time we're doing okay
we the the concern i think that we have
is we're not seeing
the number of cases peak we're not
seeing the number of hospitalizations
peak
and until we know where the peak of that
curve is
it's a little anxiety provoking to say
if we got to double or triple the
numbers we have now not saying that's
where it's going to go but
at this point we just don't know where
it's going to top out so right now
all of the hospitals that i speak with
feel that they can manage this level of
capacity
you know back in the spring when we had
somewhat similar numbers
uh slightly less than where we are now
the majority of our elective
operations were actually shut down so we
actually had a lot of extra hospital
capacity
where now we're back at a period of
normal operations for our hospital so at
some point
if the numbers just continue to rise and
rise and rise we'll run into
some difficult decisions to make but
right now we feel we have the capacity
in our hospitals we have surge capacity
especially in most of our larger
hospitals to actually increase
uh the volume of patients that we take
care of so for the time being we're okay
but at the same time if we don't start
to see the numbers start to peak and
come back down
over the next few weeks uh you know
heading into what is normally a winter
flu season where we already see in
december and january relatively high
hospital
occupancy numbers i think those two uh
uh you know
those two issues will uh collide at some
point if we don't see a change
in the trajectory of our total cases and
our total hospitalizations over the next
uh
a few weeks well i know you've seen the
chart i don't know if you can see this
one but for
our viewers um you know this goes from
april to october 16th
and this is the patient count in the
hospital so it's not how many are going
in every day but
it's what the what the census basically
is in the hospital
and doctor you were talking about
basically we don't know where this peak
is we've not hit we've clearly not hit a
plateau yet
correct um and and so you know we
you know we're always looking for that
and always looking for that plateau
we're really looking forward to go down
but we're at least looking for
a plateau but it's been a you know so
this
is uh for everyone this is the number in
the hospital
uh this down here the darker blue is
in icu and below that is in
those who have a vent so you can see
those
going going what's happening with those
numbers the icu numbers and the
ventilator numbers tend to lag the
hospitalization
numbers a little bit most patients when
they present to the hospital don't end
up in the icu
for some do right off but most for a
number of days later so
those will tend to trend up as the total
hospitalizations continue to trend up
you know as hospital uh leaders and
physician leaders nursing leaders
pharmacy leaders we all are taught to
prepare for the worst case scenario
whether it's about
any one individual patient or in this
case uh
a pandemic so i know all of my
colleagues are thinking about where do
we go
if two weeks from now the numbers look
like this or four weeks from now the
numbers look like this
we are preparing for the worst case
scenario at the same time our goal in
making sure people understand what they
need to do to try to get these numbers
to peak or the exact
things that you describe uh on your
press conferences and in your other
speeches around the state it's it's
it's relatively simple things wearing a
mask distancing
uh from others that don't live with you
in your home washing your hands
routinely and making sure that
businesses in other public areas are
keeping high touch areas clean
of of any risk of having the virus on
them the relatively simple things that
will hopefully
at to your point earlier even this
afternoon sir that we've done this
before we've
we've bent the curve and and kept this
from becoming
a a worse problem than it's been twice
over the past seven months and i'm sure
the citizens of ohio are up to the task
again
so summary numbers going up throughout
the state all three zones
um much more coming from the rural areas
than we saw
in this in the spring and
any one region i think you mentioned one
region
worse than the other or or since they're
much different
zone three which is the southwest
portion of the state is seeing
uh once again the highest numbers that
they've seen at any time
uh during the the pandemic they barely
got to 300 patients i believe this
morning they were in the 370 range they
barely got to 300 patients over the
summer
so it is definitely feels very different
to my colleagues
down there we were just on a call
yesterday morning uh discussing that but
it's really
it's it's distributed all across the
state uh region seven and eight which
are the rural
zones for zone two are seeing the
highest numbers over the past uh ten
days that they've seen at any time
during the pain
which is generally southern ohio south
central southeast ohio
they're seeing more than they've ever
seen correct correct
doctor thank you very much appreciate it
one more announcement interim director
of health lance himes
issued a directive to today to require
all labs
to start sharing all positive negative
inconclusive and
invalid test results related to cobia 19
with the ohio department of health
previously labs were reporting positive
covered results at the individual
level as an aggregate count for all
other test results
adding these categories will allow us to
gather additional data for a more
complete
picture of how covet is spreading in our
communities
this also allow us to provide positivity
data by county
in the coming weeks something we've been
looking forward to
it will take some time for us to gather
enough data to provide these positivity
rates but
we expect to have some information
available by the second week of november
barring any technical or reporting
issues
it wasn't just a question of issuing an
order if it was we would issue the order
a long time ago
but to get to this point the ohio
department of health developed a
technology
solution to allow their systems to
receive negative
test results the pandemic has shed a
light on the need for better data
collection methods and systems and this
is one of the
improvements that frankly they've been
working on and we've been waiting for
this will help address that issue in
this specific area reduce
a paperwork burden on local health
departments and will help ensure that we
have the fastest and easiest reporting
process for all parties involved
including labs
and long-term care facilities so again
positivity numbers by county that we can
rely on
um are coming coming soon
let me go to the lieutenant governor see
if he has
comments governor
um over uh over the past week you've
really
effectively explained what we are facing
as a state with the increased number of
cases
the number of high incident counties
that we see growing
i noticed that on september the 19th
we had 19 counties that were considered
high incidents
meaning that they had over 100 cases per
hundred thousand as of today we have 69
counties that that exceed that 100 cases
per 100 000 and
and as we saw on the chart earlier there
are many counties that are
300 uh 400 cases per 100 000
which is a highly concerning number
uh yesterday i spent some time calling
around to some of those counties
who were at the levels of 300 400 cases
per hundred thousand
uh and we talked we talked about the
threat that that faces not just the
state but those communities
uh in that as it's getting colder as
people are going to spend more time
inside and unless we take
some kind of action it's very hard to
break that trend
and and in these conversations we talked
about
how they can attack these issues at the
local level
we can make statewide policies but we
know that
from our our life's lessons that the
closer you get to the source of the
problem the more impact
you can have on it and we talked
we talked a lot about how to do that i
would like to highlight one county that
i really believe
has taken this charge seriously and just
give it a little explanation about
what they're doing to try to coordinate
in jackson county i want to highlight
them they
they have presently 333 cases per
hundred thousand
which is which is a high number the
county commissioners there have
initiated
weekly calls with county-wide officials
with all the mayors of their communities
with the superintendents of schools
with the health director for the county
and and other
health officials and emergency personnel
to talk through the issues that their
county is facing
and how they can go about mitigating
those issues
this is an example of what every county
can do
to help bring their leaders together and
controlling the spread
we really need people to engage like
this at the local level
in identifying hot spots potential
problems
uh and that you know we we all have
community connections this is an example
of local government officials
but but a lot of times there are
networks of not-for-profits
uh there are networks of businesses and
business associations who can do these
same kinds of things of
of coordinating efforts learning from
each other about best practices
talking about for example if you're a
business how to talk with your employees
about after work and in their
in their personal lives and how they can
help to to mitigate the problem and
and uh we're we want to thank those
local officials
and encourage them to take these
leadership roles it's not just coming
from
the governor and from me it's everybody
has the ability
to be a leader in helping to slow the
spread
as the governor often says uh we can
control this
these are the facts but we can control
by our behavior by our actions
uh how bad this gets in the con in the
coming months and
just wanted to highlight uh jackson
county uh
for what they're doing and talk with
and talk about what others can do uh and
then finally a response to a question
from last week in an update about the
ohio high school athletic association
and the events that they are overseeing
and and how they're attempting to make
sure that
we don't have spread at those particular
athletic events
we we talked with the ohio high school
athletic
association last fall and for those of
you don't know
that it's part of our responsible
restart for sports
the ohio high school athletic
association has hired what we call
observers to go out and evaluate
these game sites to educate the schools
about what they can do to make sure that
they're keeping the
facility and the event is operating as
safely as possible
and to be accountable to provide those
accountability measure measures
the observers from the ohio high school
athletic association in football have
been
have visited 458 sites
uh and observed 600 football games
uh at least 50 soccer games and at least
50 or soccer matches and 50 volleyball
matches
over the course of the fall so far
every visit results in a report back to
the school
to advise them on how they did
what they can improve upon in some cases
these reports have issued what they're
what they would call a failing grade and
we know nobody in school likes to get a
failing grade
uh and what what the athletic
association
reiterated to me on a call that we had
and to discuss this was that this didn't
mean that the school lacked a plan
it didn't mean that they refused to
follow the protocols
it meant quite the contrary in most
cases
that schools did react well to
uh the report that they were given um
and that the report didn't lack a
failure of an attempt but it really
it really um focused on
the failures to comply during the game
and
what they emphasized to us was that it
wasn't a lot the fans
it wasn't the ingress or egress or the
it was a lot of times the student
athletes themselves
at a particular point in the game as you
might have imagined where somebody
scores a touchdown
or somebody makes a great play or the
game's close at the end that those
students uh
in their enthusiasm are congregating
they're getting close together
uh and and they're basically making the
point to the schools that you got to try
to control that
you can't allow that to happen and the
schools
are being counseled on that those who
those were there were extreme instances
of of for example fans not wearing masks
at the game
those schools have received warning
letters from
the ohio high school athletic
association and all of the schools
who've received them have committed to
improved compliance in those areas
and the athletic association
was not aware of an incident of spread
due to
any of these compliance lapses but
they wanted to reassure us and the
public that they
have an accountability mechanism that
they are sending observers out there
that they and their member schools take
these responsibilities seriously
uh and the bottom line is because right
now it's it's playoff season it's
it's whether it's golf or basketball or
or i mean golf or volleyball or football
it's playoff season
and the schools themselves and the
student athletes themselves have the
most at stake
uh they they could lose their season if
they don't comply
and and um and so they felt good
about where things are from the first
game
they saw they saw a lot of confusion uh
week one
uh but those educational opportunities
have have
made compliance and and helped the
schools operate these
these venues a lot more successfully
over the course of weeks so
governor that's the report back from the
ohio high school athletic association
uh and the accountability and and and
and the potential lapses that have
occurred during course of the fall
thank you very much and uh shout out to
our friends in jackson county
um you know everything is local and the
ability of communities to come together
and talk about how they're going to
fight back against the virus is really
something that's just
exceedingly exceedingly important
let me just before we go to questions uh
talk about
sadly gun violence in ohio every week i
do this
and it's sad sadly it's just every week
they're just
gut-wrenching stories and we this is
something we can fix
the legislature has a bill in front of
it i i don't think
i don't know who is against going after
repeat violent offenders
getting them off our streets people who
have no right to have a gun
uh who continue to have guns um
for not from october 13th to the 19th at
least a dozen people were shot and
killed in ohio
another 24 or more were shot and wounded
some critically
headline one austintown mahoning valley
suspect charged with fatally shooting
man at austintown apartment complex
now we looked into the suspect's record
to find
that he's been prohibited from carrying
a gun since 2008 since 2008 he's not
been allowed to carry a gun
following a conviction on drug and gun
charges he was placed on probation
violated that probation three times
before he was ultimately sent to prison
in 2012.
suspect was released in 2013 and in 2015
he was involved in a shooting as well as
another separate incident involving
a gun
these two cases resulted in four years
of incarceration
incarceration he was released in june
2019
and was arrested again in october 2019
in pennsylvania
he was released from pennsylvania's
custody in may 2020
now less than five months later he's
accused of murder
here in ohio headline two
this one happened yesterday yesterday in
columbus five injured and shooting
crash in italian village two young
children shot
suspect charged that's the headline
according to media reports
25 shots were fired into an suv which
crashed
three kids were in the vehicle a
two-year-old who was shot in the leg
a four-year-old who was shot in the
chest a five-year-old who was injured in
the crash
the driver was grazed by a bull and a
woman who who was hit by
the car is said to have suffered serious
injuries
the suspect who is accused of this crime
of opening fire on a car
full of children is prohibited already
by law from carrying a gun he served six
years for aggravated robbery and firearm
charges before his sentence expired in
may
a warrant for his arrest was also filed
last week in conjunction with an
unrelated assault both suspects
in these cases are certainly innocent
until proven guilty
but these are the exact scenarios that
we can help prevent through senator
dolan's bill
that's pending right now in the general
assembly
it will save lives we'll go to the
questions
governor our first question today is
from dan de rose at woio in cleveland
good afternoon governor how are you dan
governor i want to walk you through i
hear from two types of
uh people in ohio today i took a phone
call about an hour before the news
conference from a viewer
who is very panicked at the numbers that
are escalating
basically saying you're not doing enough
that you need to
find some new level of either enforcing
masks whether it's through
enforcement tickets whether it's local
police or maybe new levels of shutdowns
as the numbers came out i took a text
message from
another viewer who said that at eight
deaths
today it's not that serious and that we
should never have shut down
two months ago so who's correct here who
who is on the right side of this
uh especially as numbers escalate
you know i'm always saddened by people
say we only lost
eight people today i just that makes me
sad
because for each one of those people who
died they had loved ones
they were a mother father sister brother
child
and to trivialize these lives as as i
hear some people doing is
i just i i just do not do not understand
it
others others say well
most of them were over 70. most of them
had a medical problem
i just i just don't know how we can
respect life
uh and and come up with that kind of uh
attitude
so it's it's it is serious
uh to your viewer who
said we should do more um i will tell
you i asked myself that question every
single day
uh and i asked what else can we do
uh we're significantly increasing the
testing
we're doing everything we can to get
this out as as quick as we can
i spent parts of the last eight or nine
days flying around every media market in
the state to talk directly to the people
of that region about what we're seeing
in the numbers
but what we're seeing
is most of the spread is coming
from people who are doing informal
things
it may be in their home it may be in
their backyard
it may be getting together someplace
else
and people are letting their guard down
when they're with friends
they're laying their guard down when
they're with family
um and this is a virus that
is is sneaky nasty
because it rares up uh any place
and many times the people who have it
don't know they have it
and they're carrying it and they can
spread it
we don't have the ability to go in
people's houses and we don't want to do
that
but there is a remedy
and the remedy is very much at hand
and i think i got a call from a
legislative friend of mine yesterday who
told me about two different
two different examples uh in counties
that he represents
uh where people were who in the past had
not worn masks
were wearing masks within the last few
days
basically he said they're concerned
they're seeing these numbers go up
they know more people who are coming
down with it they're changing what
they're doing
so i'm optimistic it is within our
capacity to change the future and the
fastest way we can do it is for all
not for me to issue some order uh
that you can't enforce or be difficult
to enforce
but rather for every ohioan to take this
seriously
and just to think you know it's only a
mask
it's only a mask uh
you know we think of sacrifices that
have been made by people for this
country
uh they've been huge this is only a mask
and we're just asking people to wear it
uh there may be some people who can't
wear one that's fine
they had a medical problem that's fine
but we get 85 90 95 percent of people
wearing masks we'll knock this thing
down
and so to your your viewer your caller
that's that's what i would say
help us get that message across uh to
everyone
because what each one of us does
determines whether our kids go to school
whether we keep working uh whether we
keep this virus down
next question is from jim addie at
w-h-i-o in dayton
jim good afternoon i want to go back to
the financial help that you're about to
provide to people
um what is the total dollar amount you
have to work with this is from the cares
act
what your overarching goal is and how
would that interplay with the federal
stimulus money that is coming we think
in a month or two or three whenever they
figure that out on their end in dc
how would that work together
that's a very good question um we've got
a lot of balls in the air and we don't
know
exactly what's going on because we don't
know what the congress is going to do
now i remain an optimist
i think congress is going to take action
uh i think there's a deal there to be
had
i think they will pass something this
year i think when they pass it they will
have more money in different
different tranches different different
causes different reasons
but at the same time they will give us
more flexibility that we can roll this
money over
so we're making decisions now jim uh
based on not really knowing what the
future is can we move this money across
the line
on on the 31st of december
into the next year or can't we um and we
don't really know
what's coming so what we did was we
tried to be conservative
throughout this uh what we hope to be
able to do is hold on to some of this
money frankly so we can make sure
that testing we always have enough money
through testing until we get
the immunity that we need that's going
to come through we think through
immunization
so we're balancing all these things in
our mind so what you're going to see
us come out on probably on friday
is a conservative approach which gets
money out to clearly to people who need
it right now
with the understanding that there may be
more money coming some of this may
become from the federal government we
may be able to take some money and put
it out
but i think as the governor of the state
my obligation is first
to make sure that we have the money
necessary
to cut to test as much as we can test
as many tests as we can get in here and
do the tracing the testing and the
tracing and we've got to have
money for that because if we can't do
that we can't keep the virus under
control if we can't keep the virus under
control everything goes out
out the window so it's a balance i'm an
optimist i think congress is going to do
something
give us get a bill i think there's a
deal there to be had
governor can can i add a couple points
there to that
jim's question is that look we know this
is a particularly difficult time for
businesses as a lot of the federal
assistances
run out and and this is really helping
to build a bridge
to a better day to a federal plan to
a time when the virus is is more under
control
and this is building a bridge to save a
business to save a job
and i think what the governor is is
putting together
is is going to be impactful as we roll
that out
out in the coming days
next question is from kenny bass at wchs
in charleston west virginia
hi governor you talked a lot in your
last briefing
about thanksgiving and the holiday
season which many people of course
translate into moving through christmas
and new year's
but with uh halloween just 11 days away
and it's become really
the biggest party for adults in america
not just children trick-or-treating
and with the situation that it is in
ohio right now
what is your message for people who are
still planning halloween parties get
togethers
and should everyone just resign
themselves to wearing
doctor and nurse costumes this year
which would of course include masks
thank you well i don't know about dr
nurse costumes uh
i i know for a while uh we we were
seeing uh
pictures of uh a lot of uh
young girls dressing up as uh dr amy
acton i know we were seeing we were
seeing that
but uh you know i would hope that we
would see a few more uh
uh people dressed up kids dressed up uh
as
first responders uh doctor or nurse
uh because they're doing so very very
much people who work in our nursing
homes and they're just
doing a fantastic job look i i think
there's
there's a way that people can do
trick-or-treat i always kind of come
back to
you know what do we really care about we
want to try to provide something for
kids
and we but we want to do it in a safe
way and i think parents can supervise
that and
come up with a safe way of doing it
don't
don't go right up to that door uh you
know if the lights on hope that there's
some candies
out there and for the people in the
house you know don't put it so the kid
has to
every kid has to go into the same pot
and and pull it out
uh you know there's way there's ways of
of i think of of doing this
but as far as as far as adults having
parties
look unless they can figure out a really
safe way to do it i think the answer is
just don't do it
um you know let's let's let's all be
around
next halloween make sure we're all here
um you know let's don't take chances on
for for one night of dressing up and uh
you know
going to a party you know if you want to
want to dress up in your own house and
and you know greet kids from uh a
distance at the door that's kind of a
cool thing maybe you can do
um there's other things to do but as far
as getting together with parties it's
look
they're probably gonna be inside uh and
you know i suppose there's a way to do
it if you wear a mask and you keep it
outside and
but um you know just
let's look to the future
next question is from ben schwartz at
wcpo in cincinnati
hey ben hi governor um vice president
pence
is set to hold a rally around cincinnati
tomorrow
the trump campaign says all attendees
will be given a temperature check and
masks we have had a viewer reach out
though who wants to know
how much with how much cases are rising
right now
will ohioans be able to be assured that
everyone at the event will
actually wear those masks they're given
and remain somewhat distanced
well look i i think that you know our
message has
been clear and now as you point out
as your viewer pointed out the
cases are up dramatically they're
dramatically up in southwest ohio where
you would assume most of the people will
be
will be coming coming from so i would
just
you know tell everyone they really need
to wear a mask if they go to this event
they need to keep some space um you know
this is your life that's at stake
and you know you don't know who's going
to be there
and you don't know even people who you
know
may be there don't know they have it but
might have it so when you're
going into an environment like that i
would be very very
careful i wouldn't wear a mask and i'd
want to look around and see if other
people
were in mass i too again our message is
the same whether it's a trump rally a
biden rally whether it's a protest
whatever it is you know be safe protect
the other person protect yourself
next question is from laura hancock
cleveland.com
hey laura hi governor um we were
wondering
um you've talked a little bit about
cases
about the age going up in cases in
recent weeks
um so in other words cases of older
people are increasing and we're
wondering if you could elaborate a
little bit on that why is that
well i don't think anybody really knows
for sure why that is but it is a marked
change from june july when we saw the
last
bike we saw the last spike it was over
you know 50 percent was under 30 years
of age
i don't have the numbers off the top of
my head nor do i have a chart in front
of me
but these numbers are creeping up and
so you know what we are assuming but
don't really know
we're assuming that this is a rebound uh
from young people who had it earlier
uh and who have infected older people
um you know that's that's about the best
we can do at least the best i can do
as far as trying to figure out what what
really is going on
but it worries us because we know the
older
group of people you get the more likely
they are to end up in a hospital
the more likely they are to die so you
know
it doesn't mean that the 50 that in june
were under
under 30 or were totally safe but uh
statistically you're you know you're
going to have fewer people end up in a
hospital a younger group so
the age group is certainly is certainly
certainly going up
and it's worrisome and i'll try on
thursday to
break those numbers down a little bit
further we'll take a look at where they
are as of thursday
next question is from jim province at
the toledo blade
governor um it's been a month since the
dayton and toledo areas were the sites
of uh large political rallies now you've
talked about the pence rally coming up
but you since you've noticed that the
western part of the state has been
problematic for us for the last few
weeks
lucas and montgomery counties are both
in the red now
have we found any connection between
those rallies and
any cases that a test deposit yeah i'll
ask the local health departments is i
recall
i've got check uh some of them did find
a connection
but i want to i want to verify that and
we'll get back to you
about about that um look
anytime you get a group of people coming
together in large numbers we
you know we worry about and we certainly
worry about if they're not wearing masks
um you know we've seen a
lot of spread particularly in southwest
ohio
all the way through this if you go back
you know
sadly montgomery county county right
next door to
fran i live greene county uh you know
has been read
an awful lot as this thing has gone
through it so
um certainly in in southwest ohio
the virus is has been here and the
numbers have been
pretty high for a long time we've also
seen
you know along the particularly rural
counties going up
in northwest ohio particularly along the
indiana border a couple counties even
over
at least two deep sometimes three deep
those counties have been
high for an extended period of time i
mean some of those counties have been
bred for
12 i think 11 or 12 separate weeks
so you know it it's
these count these areas were already
going the wrong way unfortunately
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
hey governor max i wanted to ask
if you could speak a little bit to the
vaccine plan that's getting um
published later this week online um is
this supposed to be sort of a
living document of sorts and can you
speak a little bit more to the
complexities of this distribution model
yeah living document might be a good way
to describe it um
it is you know something the federal
government wanted
uh from us um our big you know
our next step is to go online
and get these different places signed up
you know this is obviously being driven
by the federal government by the
administration
they want to make sure the states are
ready which i fully
fully understand and appreciate that
um you know a lot of this
uh may be sent directly
directly to the people who are going to
end up
administering it some of it
it looks like will come to us so we can
break it out into smaller
parcels so that's just a basic
distribution issue
and again we're waiting for further
information from from the federal
government but i think part of it's
going to go directly
to a hospital you know bigger hospitals
certainly
don't get it directly you know other
places may
be more efficient for us to have to
break it break it out it's going to come
in fairly
large chunks and um
again we don't know when this is going
to be uh
you know you're following it just like
we are on on on
on tv um federal government has come up
with some
preliminary uh priorities they certainly
are the logical
priorities uh pretty much match what
we've looked at
which is we want to take care uh you
know of
the most vulnerable people first but
also at the same time try to take care
of uh
you know get immunized those who are the
front lines
people who are dealing with people with
coven we've got to get them taken care
of early on
so those two those two groups early and
then we move into other
groups beyond that
next question is from jesse ballmer at
the cincinnati enquirer
hi governor um my question is looking at
the high number of hospitalizations
today
are there any sort of changes that you
would anticipate
making if the surge if there was a surge
such as limiting elective surgeries
again
and then a quick question are you or the
lieutenant governor going to the
defense rally in cincinnati tomorrow
yeah you know i'm not going
um i don't know whether lieutenant
governor is going or not he can
you can answer that um
as far as what we do
you know when elective surgeries were
cut off and we issued an order on that
that was at the
at the advice of our hospitals um
so you know in cincinnati i was in
cincinnati
uh on friday and
right before i got there saw a story uh
maybe in your story that basically said
that uh you know they were quoted
uh on the doctors uh as saying that
you know we have two weeks cincinnati
southwest ohio we got two weeks to get
this under control and if we don't we're
starting to jeopardize elective
surgeries so we don't want to do i mean
we don't want to see that
and my point is if that's going to be
driven by what the hospitals are seeing
and what their space is
and they're going to know and you know
it may hit one hospital at one point
another one at another point but
you know we still have time we still
have time uh
to slow this down we do not want to be
uh you know
what what we've seen time and time again
on tv beginning in italy and then new
york and new york and
different places we don't want to be
that we have avoided it
i would say to my fellow islands we
we've done well we've avoided this we
had a lot of great tragedy
but we we've not had these huge spikes
and uh we just don't want to see that
and we can
we really can control this we've got to
control it
now's the time now's the time to get on
it we got to do it
governor uh just quick answer to the
question i visited with uh vice
president pence last week when he was in
columbus but i do not attend do not
intend to uh go to the event tomorrow in
cincinnati
yeah let me just add one thing about
vice president pence
uh and i i talked to him you know
regularly um he's done a phenomenal job
with the
white house task force we're on the
phone generally once a week
with in a bigger group sometimes
one-on-one but
always you know certainly in a bigger
group with governors
and uh you know very very
focused uh he's been exceedingly focused
on saving lives exceedingly focused on
keeping the spread down and
i appreciate what what he's done
next question is from adrian robbins at
wcmh
in columbus governor
you said what's at stake is our children
being able to go to school
you've left the decision on how to open
up schools up to the local level up to
this point
but with the spread of the coronavirus
happening statewide are you considering
maybe statewide action on schools of
cases continue to go up
and just as a side note do you still
plan on addressing the last call for
bars and restaurants this week
yeah we're not going to do that uh we're
not going to do the bars and restaurants
sadly um you know i understand
i've heard talk to bar owners restaurant
owners and i understand
what's at stake for them but with these
numbers going crazy
we can't do this now so i hope in the
future we'll be able to lift those hours
but we're not gonna
it would be in my opinion very
irresponsible at this point
for a governor to to do this so we gotta
start getting those numbers get those
numbers down
and i'm sorry you had a second you got a
second question i think
yes sorry governor um my second question
was just
you've left the decision up to for
schools up to the local level
would you consider statewide action
though if if cases continue to go up
well i think you know there's there's a
much better option and that better
option is
ohioans you know we're in the mask
keeping safe uh we we can control this
but i
my point as i started uh was simply that
there's a lot at stake as we see this
spread
and we're already seeing schools making
decisions to go remote
we're seeing schools making decisions to
continue remote you know and
many times we're seeing these decisions
being made in our cities
and so what's at stake is we have
a large number of our children in our
cities and other places
who are totally remote and if we can't
get control of this
these schools are not going to flip back
to hybrid or flip back
to five days a week they're still you're
starting to see them now make decisions
to continue for the rest of the year
rest of the calendar year
at least remote
and i think we should consider what
impact that has
on these children i'm not questioning
why the schools are doing it but what i
am saying is
we can create a better environment so if
these schools
don't do this don't feel that they need
to do this
we can create the environment in our
communities and it's incumbent upon us
the adults
to do that so that our kids can be in
school
now some kids are due very well remotely
some kids have a lot of support they got
parents
um sometimes they got grandparents
they're working with them
they do okay we have other children who
may not have that
um and we we have to worry about them
and we have to worry about the long-term
impact of the of these children
so we can control this
and again my plea
today again is let's do that for the
sake of our kids
next question is from alex ebert at
bloomberg
good afternoon governor there's a
business roundtable group
in ohio that is urging businesses
to tell their workers
to vote for republican-aligned
candidates for the supreme court
or risk losing their jobs as a
prosecutor for years and as the state's
attorney general who
is before the justices in the court how
does this make you feel
about the way this group is portraying
the the court and what will happen
if certain justices are elected thanks
well i don't know what the facts are and
you know these these
these are always fact driven obviously
uh no one can or should tell their
employee
uh how to vote they can't
tell them that if they vote a certain
way that they're going to
because they voted a certain way they're
going to lose their job
businesses based on the first amendment
certainly have the right to tell their
employees
what they think um employees have equal
right to do whatever they want to do
and so but no one can condition a job on
on how you vote
first of all our ballots are secret and
and
are protected anyway but um so i don't
know the facts
but those would be the basic guiding
principles that i think should guide us
all
next question is from laura bischoff at
the dayton daily news
um hi governor you talk about you you uh
it's your understanding that a lot of
the spread is from informal gatherings
is that
anecdotal or is there some real data
from contact tracing that tells us that
and also given the trajectory of ohio's
numbers
uh what are the risks of having three to
four million voters going directly to
the polls
two weeks from now
well secretary larose told me that he
thinks it's very possible and this was a
week ago
so numbers may change but it's very
possible that we'll have more people
vote before election day than vote on
election day
uh even with an increased turnout which
would appear we're having
um it means that that people are going
to be more spread out
on election day uh i am not i think
people can do this
safely they've got to be careful um you
know they need if they're
they have ample opportunity to vote
before they can do it by
absentee ballot they can do go to the
board of elections this weekend
of course you know opens up weekend
voting people go to the board of
elections again
they'll try to figure out when there's
not a lot of people there stand in line
keep the distance
wear a mask um so
i i think on election day yes people can
go if they're careful
um and and they can they can vote
um so i think that you know
they people have had a what's
different about this is that people have
had a long enough time
to understand the virus and how it has
spread
so that they can take their own
circumstances into
uh account and make a decision do i want
to
go vote in person do i want to go
sit in my home and and fill it out and
never have to go out and so
people had a chance to make those
decisions they were making those
decisions and
you know i feel i feel that it certainly
it can be but
it's important it's important that
everyone who go to the polls wear a mask
you know you've got poll workers who are
sitting there and poll workers i worry
a lot about uh they're there for 13
hours
that's open the polls open and then i
assume they get there an hour or so
before
and then after so they're there a long
long day
and for at least 13 hours they're
directly in contact with
with voters and so they you know
we we should help them and make sure
they can stay safe by everyone who goes
through that line everybody who goes to
vote
uh should wear a mask
next question is from josh roltenberg at
spectrum news
hi governor i just wanted to follow up
on adrian's question i'm not sure you
answered it directly are you considering
statewide action on schools
not at the moment
yeah the answer is no yeah and i did not
answer that
and uh um not at the moment
i mean the situation i described is
where i think we are
today we are a local government state we
have relied on
throughout our history we have relied on
our local school boards
our local families to make decisions
about their schools
um going through a very
very tough period of time we still rely
on those families
to make decisions we give them a lot of
guidance
excuse me put on a mask order which was
not very popular with
some people uh and with the exception of
uh
you know one or two schools um
teachers principals have done a great
job
students have done a great job in
wearing masks and doing everything they
can
to to be safe while we have seen
some cases certainly associated with
schools
the spread in schools themselves
with students wearing masks we don't
believe from what we're seeing
is huge anytime you put people together
there's a risk
but they're doing it in the safest way
as they can in person
still there is always some risk
and there's a particular risk when the
county
positivity rate is high the number of
cases are high
and so you know again one of the reasons
we put out the
color code one of the reasons we list
the counties and so you can look and see
how many cases are in your county
relative to other counties for the last
two weeks the reason we put that data
out
all the time every day is so that people
can make decisions about
should my child go to school should the
school stay open what should the school
do
but we also know that
in person for most kids
is probably the best and is the best
and so that's kind of where we would
hope to get but we can't get there
when we've got these high numbers so
we've we've got to
we we got to deal with the high numbers
and we can deal with them but if we
don't
it's abundantly clear from what we're
seeing is more schools are going
online and more schools are extending
online and some schools that were in
person before now going online
and that is a natural consequence of the
rise in cases
in in the community so it's incumbent
upon the adults it seems to me
to drive those numbers down and we have
the power to do it
next question is from jack windsor and
wmfd
in mansfield hey jack hi governor
amy acton said that her dream was to
have immunity certificates that would
allow people to reclaim their freedoms
and be admitted back to normal life
she also indicated the desire to
eliminate any exemptions for vaccines
now dr fauci has signaled that the first
vaccines may not be highly effective so
given the fact that acton was so adamant
and it appears he's still giving some
advice to the administration for your
previous comments
two-part question is it your position to
require vaccination and immunity proof
in order to go back to normal life or
will you backdoor mandate a vaccine by
allowing businesses and schools
to shut people out who don't choose to
vaccinate
jack i'm sorry you're still you're still
uh attacking dr
acton i you know i'm just sorry that you
you feel it necessary to do that but
i didn't attack dr act and i just i just
indicated what she stated
okay okay all right um
look um we're not going to require
anyone to get a vaccine
that's not going to be any any
requirement we hope people will get
vaccines
and i think that when people watch the
process
occur watch people go through it watch
what the cdc says
watch what the experts say say about
this
that they're going to have confidence
and they'll they'll be willing to the
you know significant number of people uh
enough people
uh will be willing to take the vaccine
but we're not we're not we don't require
any vaccination
uh you know we don't require uh not
gonna require them to
take a vaccine we hope that they will
and
i think also we'll see when we'll see
the results
of what happens
when the first responders take it and
others take it
and i think that will build i think that
should build confidence in people
that they'll want to take the vaccine
but we're not going to require that
governor next question is the last
question today and it belongs to kevin
landers
at wbns in columbus
hi kevin governor for seven months
you've told people about the importance
of wearing a mask if the numbers of
positive cases are higher
hospitalizations are higher than now
ever before
does this lead you to believe that
irresponsible behavior is driving up the
numbers and if so
how do you combat that when your words
don't seem to be resonating with people
thank you well as i as i mentioned
a little bit ago i got a call from a
legislator talking about two rural
rural counties where i know the spread
has been high and and what he basically
told me one to call me yesterday and he
said look
i want to tell you good news uh and he
says
a lot a lot more compliance in these two
counties as i was events
within the last i think week they said
people are scared
they're concerned uh and they're they're
a lot more high
compliance and he says i think that when
people
um are see what the reality is that they
will
you know more and more people will will
wear a mask so
i'm optimistic i think that we will see
this
and you know we saw it before um ohioans
in june july when we started
that's when we saw that surge we knocked
that surge down
and how did we do it well one of the
main ways we did it was through wearing
a mask
and we saw mass compliance in our urban
areas which is where at that time we
were seeing a real
real spike that mass compliance went up
dramatically so i'm optimistic
i think that again
as communities come together uh which
we're asking them to do to talk about
this
and and to you know talk about what is
the best plan so they can keep their
schools open
uh best planned so they can move forward
their economy
i think they're going to you know come
to the conclusion that this is
what what has to be done and so i'm i
think we're going to turn this thing
around
again we've done it twice before we can
certainly certainly do it this time
so that was the last question um
i will close for where i began um
these numbers are grim they are going
the wrong direction
every every everything is going the
wrong direction
but we know what will work we've done
this before
we've done on two other occasions and
there is so much
so much at stake and again to close
where i started
uh one of the most important things that
is at stake
is the education and the future of our
children
you know we do not want to skimp uh
or in any way hurt the education of our
young
people and the best way to do that the
best way to keep them in school
is for each one of us to wear a mask
each one of us to keep
a distance each one of us when we're
thinking about a halloween party
say no we're not going to do it when
we're thinking about
getting together with friends or family
who you know don't live with us
closely um say look we gotta have a mask
uh and we gotta be very very careful uh
if we do that
if we do that and i think we will uh
we're going to knock this thing down
and we'll have more of our kids in
school and we'll be able to give them
the education that we
really uh owe them and that's what
this is it's about a lot of things but
certainly about our kids
i look forward to seeing you all on
thursday thank you very much
thank you
