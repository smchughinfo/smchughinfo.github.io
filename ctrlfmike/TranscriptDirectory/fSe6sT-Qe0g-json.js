    "of year",
    "i want to start",
    "with something i've talked about every",
    "week",
    "and i'm frankly going to continue to do",
    "that through this as long as it's",
    "necessary to do it",
    "and that is the tragedy of gun violence",
    "where we have repeat offenders",
    "violent offenders who have a gun and",
    "they have no right to have a gun",
    "this past week at least 20 people",
    "in ohio died",
    "last tuesday through yesterday due to",
    "gun violence",
    "seven days 20 people murdered an",
    "additional 21 or more people",

    "there is legislation that has been",

    "almost a year",
    "i think it's tougher on those",
    "responsible for the majority of violent",
    "crime in this state",
    "and those are the convicted felons who",
    "illegally",
    "carry guns who doesn't want to get tough",
    "against convicted",
    "felons who illegally carry guns",
    "right now many of these felons are not",
    "getting",
    "locked up when they're found with guns",
    "current state law uh considers this a",
    "lower level uh non-violent offense",
    "uh oftentimes this results in in",
    "probation",
    "despite the fact that those who are",
    "willing to break the law and carry a gun",
    "are often the people who are willing to",
    "hurt or kill with that weapon i'm not",
    "blaming judges",
    "um the law needs to frankly be changed",
    "and that's what i'm proposing to do",
    "let's look at a couple",
    "of the victims",
    "six-year-old marvea jones was shot",
    "earlier this month",
    "she lived for two weeks before dying",
    "last tuesday",
    "a little girl another child full of",

    "dead",
    "sandusky police identified the man malik",
    "aaron as the suspected gunman according",
    "to public records he is a convicted",
    "felon who is prohibited from having a",
    "gun",
    "sandusky police issued a warrant for his",
    "arrest and warned that he should be",
    "considered",
    "armed and dangerous this man is still",
    "wanted",
    "he's out there on our streets and we",
    "need to find him",
    "i want to stress that everyone of course",
    "is innocent until proven guilty",
    "however if this is the person",
    "responsible",
    "there is no doubt that he would have",
    "known that he couldn't have a gun",
    "on at least two occasions the court",
    "informed him in writing that he did not",
    "have the right to carry a gun",
    "let me read directly from the court's",
    "entry the defendant is hereby notified",
    "that under federal law",
    "persons convicted of felonies could",
    "never lawfully possess a firearm",
    "the defendant was further notified that",
    "if he is ever found with a firearm",
    "even one belonging to someone else he",
    "could be subject to prosecution by",
    "federal authorities and subject to",
    "imprisonment",
    "for several years end of quote now",
    "federal law is tougher",

    "offender",

    "yesterday in cincinnati united states",
    "attorney for the southern district of",
    "ohio announced that they had federally",
    "indicted 16 people",
    "in regard to gun violence in hamilton",
    "county and that is",
    "great great news but the reason the",
    "federal authorities",
    "have to get involved with cases like",
    "this is because of what i've been saying",
    "week after week",
    "and that is that state law isn't tough",
    "enough on these criminals",
    "and the truth is that there are only so",
    "many of these cases that",
    "authorities can take and so many times",
    "our county prosecuting attorneys our",
    "sheriffs our police",
    "when they find someone convicted felon",
    "someone who has committed a violent act",
    "in the past who has no right to have a",
    "gun",
    "but is found in possession of a gun they",
    "can't take those into federal court",
    "because there's just",
    "not enough ability to prosecute those in",
    "federal court",
    "and the federal prosecutors have to pick",
    "and choose which ones to take",
    "so we need to give our local prosecuting",
    "attorneys our 88 county prosecuting",
    "attorneys the ability",
    "to take those cases now our bill does",
    "not require mandatory sentencing we",
    "leave it up to the judge",
    "but this is a vast improvement it's an",
    "improvement",
    "of our law that mayors improvement of",
    "our law that chiefs of police have asked",
    "me",
    "for and it's something that we really",
    "need to do",
    "we need to give our local authorities um",
    "the ability the ability uh to",
    "save lives and get these repeat violent",
    "offenders off our streets",
    "eric let's go to the data for today",
    "today we're reporting 1105 new cases in",
    "ohio",
    "um that is above the average as you can",
    "see",
    "by looking at this we've been hovering",
    "on around a thousand",
    "of and for i'll say four out of the last",
    "seven days we've been under",
    "a thousand maybe maybe five of those",
    "days uh but we are back we are up",
    "today part of this is that the",
    "collection of the cases just",
    "it goes down and the reporting it goes",
    "down on the weekend",
    "so again we are now hovering right",
    "around a thousand uh we certainly want",
    "to",
    "you know keep that uh that number that",
    "number down",
    "number of deaths reported 37",
    "in the last 24 hours number of new",
    "hospitalizations",
    "106 in number of icu missions",
    "third 13. so those numbers are up",
    "we assume they smooth out as the week if",
    "you take all seven days",
    "again if you look at the 21 day average",
    "this is something to keep",
    "everyone to keep their eye on",
    "eric let's go to the cases now ranked uh",
    "as we've described in the past this",
    "chart",
    "takes the number of covet cases from",
    "some in this case from september 14th",
    "to september 27th and then makes a",
    "calculation based on the population size",
    "of that county to get the number of",
    "cases",
    "per 100 000 so it's not history it's the",
    "last",
    "14 days this allows us to compare",
    "counties with different population sizes",
    "so it's an apples to apples comparison",
    "this is why for example franklin county",
    "has the highest number of cases during",
    "this period with 1",
    "457 cases but is only 17th on this list",
    "because they also have a much larger",
    "population putnam mercer pike counties",
    "come in",
    "with the top three highest uh case rates",
    "per",
    "100 000. so these are the top 20 putnam",
    "mercer pike wood athens shelby lawrence",
    "henry",
    "jackson defiance dark miami butler and",
    "on down",
    "on down the list",
    "and what you see behind me now is the",
    "entire list of all all 88 counties",
    "uh and again we'll we'll talk more about",
    "this",
    "uh on on thursday when we give you an",
    "update on the",
    "uh color code but this ranking that",
    "you're looking at now is just",
    "one other way to look at it the color",
    "code is more focused on",
    "hospitalization and health use",
    "with some early indicators built into it",
    "uh",
    "the data you're looking at now is just",
    "straight numbers just straight how many",
    "cases in the last 14",
    "14 days i want to share a couple of",
    "stories i've heard during the past",
    "several weeks about the virus spread",
    "every monday uh",
    "7 15 in the morning we get on the phone",
    "with all our 113 health",
    "departments around the state and they",
    "tell us you know what they're seeing on",
    "on the ground",
    "one example happened in one of our",
    "larger counties",
    "involved a group of 21 co-workers who",
    "got together",
    "two weeks ago and got together as a",
    "group",
    "someone in that group had covered 19",
    "didn't know it uh now sadly 12 people",
    "have tested positive nine additional",
    "co-workers and three family",
    "members of those co-workers so again",
    "what we're seeing",
    "many many times is not what occurs",
    "necessarily directly in business or what",
    "occurs in classrooms",
    "but rather what occurs as people get",
    "just get together",
    "and we just you know alert everyone to",
    "please be very very careful",
    "about that here is another story i",
    "learned of another story my call to",
    "local health commissioners i wanted to",
    "share a very very sad story",
    "on august 28th the family in a more",
    "rural county had a wedding",
    "as a result of that wedding 11 people",
    "tested positive",
    "the bride and groom both got sick so did",
    "parents and so did grandparents",
    "a couple of weeks after the wedding one",
    "the grandfathers of the couple",
    "tragically passed away we tell these",
    "stories not",
    "because we want to tell them and we",
    "don't want to",
    "you know inflict more pain on anyone",
    "it's just a heartbreaking situation",
    "but we tell them so that other families",
    "will won't have",
    "the same the same heartbreak this just",
    "occurs",
    "when people are getting together in",
    "groups and you're with friends or",
    "the family and people just let their",
    "guard down",
    "that just it just happens",
    "last week i said we would provide an",
    "update on our wastewater monitoring",
    "project",
    "this is an exciting project and i've",
    "asked",
    "rebecca fuga to join us to talk about",
    "this project",
    "she is the assistant chief of the bureau",
    "of environmental health and radiation",
    "protection",
    "for the ohio department of health she",
    "has worked at the bureau for",
    "25 years um",
    "becca are you on there see if i can see",
    "you okay",
    "yes i am sir thank you thank you for",
    "joining us we appreciate it",
    "uh tell everyone why we are monitoring",
    "wastewater and how that is working",
    "okay so the ohio coronavirus wastewater",
    "monitoring network",
    "test wastes water for gene fragments of",
    "cobin 19.",
    "because people start to shed the virus",
    "early when infected",
    "a significant sustained increase in",
    "these gene fragments found in wastewater",
    "can be an early warning sign of a",
    "pending increase in a specific area's",
    "coveted 19 cases and could point to",
    "possible hot spots or potential",
    "community spread",
    "having this information gives",
    "communities an opportunity to act",
    "proactively to prevent outbreaks and",
    "you talk about early uh any idea how",
    "early",
    "this might be compared to when people",
    "start you start seeing people with",
    "with symptoms anyway",
    "yes yeah go ahead research suggests",
    "and our and our data indicates that we",
    "start to see increase in cases anywhere",
    "from four to seven days prior to",
    "um and we start to see the increases in",
    "the wastewater three to seven days",
    "before increases in cases",
    "and and how many cities are we looking",
    "at that now",
    "we're currently we've seen increases in",
    "about six cities over the last several",
    "weeks and most recently in three cities",
    "across the state and and how many total",
    "cities are being monitored now do you",
    "know",
    "we're currently monitoring 36 cities and",
    "we plan on increasing",
    "uh an additional 25 cities within the",
    "next month",
    "you and i talked earlier today and you",
    "told me that this is kind of a work in",
    "in",
    "in progress and that you're",
    "not only are you warning cities or",
    "communities when you see something but",
    "we're trying to learn some things as",
    "well can you talk a little bit about",
    "what we know",
    "maybe what we don't know yet and what",
    "we're trying to what we're trying to",
    "learn",
    "well what we're trying to do is we're",
    "monitoring the viral gene copies",
    "that we're seeing in the wastewater and",
    "we're just starting to begin to compare",
    "that to case data",
    "within communities so that we can",
    "confirm that we do in fact see this",
    "as this viral gene data as a leading",
    "indicator of disease",
    "so we're closely monitoring the results",
    "that we're seeing",
    "across our state we're monitoring a",
    "number of sites bi-weekly now",
    "we'll be moving to monitoring all of our",
    "sites bi-weekly",
    "so that we are able to provide that",
    "three to seven day leading indicator of",
    "disease",
    "and then when we see this information",
    "when we see increases",
    "we alert health officials and utilities",
    "of any sustained",
    "tech upticks in their communities and",
    "we've provided a toolkit that helps",
    "inform the public",
    "and we're coordinating to help offer",
    "pop-up testing and contract",
    "contact tracing support for those",
    "communities",
    "i'm just most recently um we've worked",
    "with several local health districts to",
    "do this",
    "and what districts have you worked with",
    "i think you told me mansfield",
    "akron yes um",
    "as well as lucas county as well you",
    "wanna just tell us a little bit about",
    "about that sure um the toledo lucas",
    "county health department has a pop-up",
    "testing event planned and has notified",
    "the community",
    "through a press release about the",
    "increases in their wastewater data",
    "we've most recently worked with the",
    "richland county health district",
    "they've issued a press release today",
    "regarding increases observed in",
    "mansfield following the labor day",
    "weekend",
    "the increase in gene fragments in the",
    "wastewater was observed about",
    "five to seven days before we saw",
    "increases",
    "in the community so when the virus does",
    "increase",
    "in the community it can quickly spread",
    "to impact other businesses and",
    "facilities within the community",
    "and then in summit county officials are",
    "comparing our findings",
    "with coven 19 case data for the area",
    "served by the plan in akron so they can",
    "better identify some of their hot spots",
    "and areas of concern",
    "so i i don't pretend to be a wastewater",
    "expert um",
    "when you do this let's say you're doing",
    "a a",
    "like lucas county is there one place",
    "that all goes to",
    "or or is there ways to actually see",
    "where that's come where that's coming",
    "from",
    "currently in the monetary network we're",
    "measuring the gene copies",
    "in the raw wastewater that's entering",
    "the wastewater treatment plant",
    "so right now the data that we collect",
    "reflects the community that's served by",
    "the wastewater treatment plant",
    "we do have the ability excuse me we do",
    "have the ability to go into communities",
    "and monitor in specific sub sewer sheds",
    "within that community",
    "we just haven't started doing that yet",
    "within the network but that is a",
    "possibility and it's been elsewhere",
    "across the country",
    "you know and i think you told me for for",
    "lucas county",
    "um it was it was actually organ is that",
    "right",
    "was not actually it was not actually the",
    "city of toledo",
    "exactly is that correct that's correct",
    "it was in the suburb of oregon",
    "okay very good um",
    "as we move as we move forward um",
    "are you going to expand the number of",
    "sites",
    "yes we currently have 36 sites that",
    "we're monitoring that and we'll be",
    "adding an additional 25 sites in the",
    "coming month",
    "okay all right we look forward to uh",
    "hearing more",
    "and uh and learning more thank you very",
    "much we appreciate it",
    "thank you for having me thank you",
    "our ohio department of rehabilitation",
    "and correction also recently began",
    "conducting wastewater monitoring at",
    "ohio's prisons",
    "we've talked many times about how",
    "challenging it can be",
    "to prevent spread in any congregate",
    "setting such as a prison",
    "where a positive case in one person can",
    "certainly have a ripple effect",
    "director annette chamber smith is here",
    "with us",
    "on skype this afternoon talk about how",
    "they're using waste water data to help",
    "them and really also kind of give a",
    "report on",
    "covet in in ohio prisons and what the",
    "department is doing",
    "about that director thanks for joining",
    "us",
    "uh good afternoon uh yes we have been",
    "interested in wastewater since about",
    "june in fact one of the deputy directors",
    "came",
    "in with a newspaper article and was like",
    "hey there's this wastewater thing and",
    "we went to osu's environmental health",
    "area and said you know is this credible",
    "should we be using it and started",
    "researching it",
    "at the same time the u.s epa came to us",
    "and asked to conduct",
    "a study and so we said sure we would",
    "love that so they started in june",
    "collecting wastewater at one prison",
    "and then a short time later osu started",
    "collecting wastewater numbers in three",
    "prisons",
    "and what we saw was some correlation to",
    "what was going on in the prison as",
    "rebecca",
    "just mentioned so we decided to test",
    "every prison every week and we've been",
    "doing that since the first week of",
    "september",
    "and what we're finding is there's a",
    "relationship between",
    "um what's going on in the prison and and",
    "the wastewater and it",
    "in the early warning aspect of it does",
    "appear to be happening for us",
    "i don't think we all have enough data",
    "right now to say conclusively",
    "uh exactly how many days it is but yes",
    "it looks like it's about seven days",
    "and that's precious time for us to plan",
    "so",
    "we use it as an early warning system and",
    "so far we've been using it to do things",
    "like",
    "decide how many cohorts can be together",
    "whether or not we're going to have",
    "visiting just a whole host of decisions",
    "that are made",
    "that can make the prison safer if covet",
    "is is going to be coming there",
    "but now i'm putting out an executive",
    "order",
    "that will require staff to be tested",
    "when",
    "certain indicators like positivity of",
    "staff positivity of the incarcerated",
    "adults or the wastewater indicators",
    "show that there's a problem with covet",
    "in that prison we would not require",
    "testing",
    "if there's not any indicators but if",
    "there is and",
    "wastewater is a leading indicator that",
    "happens before hospitalizations before",
    "the cases come through testing",
    "that would help us control things",
    "because we know that",
    "kovic comes into prisons from the",
    "outside but once it gets in there it's",
    "very difficult to stop it",
    "so requiring staff to test at the point",
    "where we know that that would be useful",
    "that's what the executive order is about",
    "and then every other prison will always",
    "have",
    "um staff being able to do voluntary",
    "testing",
    "so we're going to start the mandatory um",
    "testing on",
    "october 6 at only those sites that",
    "trigger",
    "you know these indicators and what's",
    "wastewater is definitely an important",
    "one because it is the only one that's",
    "really a leading indicator",
    "and you want to tell us a little bit",
    "about um",
    "what the protocol you you you told me a",
    "moment ago about",
    "what you're announcing today but what's",
    "what's been",
    "the protocol as far as testing how do",
    "you how do you do that",
    "so in the past we've tried several",
    "different",
    "methods of voluntary testing",
    "such as having the national guard help",
    "us test on site",
    "in the parking lot setting up contracts",
    "with local hospitals near the prison",
    "so we since the beginning of coba we've",
    "had different ways",
    "for our staff to test as well as they",
    "can take advantage of any of the testing",
    "that goes on in the community",
    "but to be frank with you when we have a",
    "staffing shortage",
    "and people are working double shifts the",
    "last thing they're trying to do",
    "is go somewhere in the community and get",
    "a test or if they have to work their",
    "days off",
    "i mean we have a very hard working staff",
    "they've been doing great work",
    "and what we want to do is bring the",
    "testing to the facility all the time so",
    "they can get it",
    "while they're on duty they don't have to",
    "miss a beat",
    "or take any other personal time to do it",
    "so",
    "we're really transitioning from just",
    "like catches catch can",
    "and using contracts in the communities",
    "to",
    "having it on site and the staff being",
    "able to do it when when they think they",
    "have symptoms when they're concerned",
    "about exposure they can do it",
    "and then also if we have a problem we'll",
    "require it",
    "uh you want to tell us a little bit uh i",
    "think",
    "we talked about mansfield we've got",
    "some cases there i believe but maybe",
    "just give us an overall",
    "report of all the all the prison",
    "facilities now you don't have to take",
    "them one by one but just give us kind of",
    "a summary",
    "well we do have 79 staff members who are",
    "currently positive for covid",
    "and we have 266 people that live in the",
    "prisons that are currently positive",
    "three of our prisons make up the",
    "majority of the positivity",
    "that's richland correctional institution",
    "which you just asked about",
    "the correction reception center and",
    "madison correctional institution those",
    "three prisons have the majority",
    "of the positive cases we have about",
    "one-third of our prisons that don't have",
    "covet at all not in their wastewater not",
    "with their staff testing nor with their",
    "incarcerated adult testing which is",
    "great um",
    "and then you know the next thing we're",
    "going to be doing is",
    "um flu shots so we want to make sure",
    "that our staff and our incarcerated",
    "adults",
    "are vaccinated so that we don't have to",
    "use",
    "resources or have additional people sick",
    "and",
    "confusing flu symptoms with covet",
    "symptoms",
    "we don't want to be fighting on all",
    "fronts so we're going to really try to",
    "make",
    "vaccinations accessible again we'll do",
    "those on-site for our staff",
    "we're partnering with a local provider",
    "to come in do the shots at different",
    "times different days and then of course",
    "our",
    "medical staff that work in the prisons",
    "will provide the vaccinations to",
    "all of the incarcerated people so the",
    "multi-prong attack that changes with the",
    "seasons",
    "including an environmental aspect that",
    "we've been pursuing",
    "tell me a little bit i know you've been",
    "doing some work about",
    "air flow inside inside the prison",
    "you want to talk to us a little bit",
    "about that yes",
    "in april our hvac experts",
    "started changing the air circulation",
    "between the fresh air outside in the",
    "recirculation to have more fresh air",
    "coming from outside",
    "sometimes up to 100 if the system could",
    "take that",
    "just that was the beginning of starting",
    "to look at environmental factors",
    "after we'd already done social",
    "distancing to the extent possible and",
    "wearing masks and",
    "gloves and you know washing your hands",
    "and all the different things we do to",
    "try to find copa that a person is",
    "responsible for",
    "we then turn to start looking at well",
    "now what we can do with our environment",
    "so that's how the hvac system started",
    "working",
    "and then we engaged an environmental",
    "health specialist from osu",
    "named dr weir and he has been working",
    "with us to choose",
    "ionization infiltration systems",
    "those filtration systems are installed",
    "at five of our facilities",
    "and they're supposed to you know",
    "obviously clean cove it out of the air",
    "and osu will be doing testing to make",
    "sure that they do",
    "and if they do we'll buy more for more",
    "facilities but",
    "there's been a lot of magic beans during",
    "cobin so we don't want to buy too much",
    "of something without really making sure",
    "that it has efficacy",
    "but according to dr where this system is",
    "the one that's most promising out there",
    "so that would clean the air and we put",
    "that in a places like where we have",
    "high acuity people at those five sites",
    "and we did that in april",
    "and then in may um we changed out our",
    "filters",
    "uh to have the highest mirv rating that",
    "that the system can handle um",
    "so that's an additional filtration",
    "measure",
    "and now we're in the process of in",
    "procuring",
    "a portable air filtration systems for",
    "additional filtrations",
    "in places like the visiting area or",
    "entry",
    "or the medical area so we we're just",
    "really trying to take care of",
    "our physical plant as well because",
    "you know when winter comes everybody's",
    "going to be inside all the time and we",
    "want to make sure we have the very best",
    "chance we have",
    "can have thank you very much",
    "good good to have you on and we'll get a",
    "report in a few more weeks but thank you",
    "we now turn to the department of",
    "medicaid um",
    "since coming into office in january 2019",
    "our administration has been evaluating",
    "our medicaid program",
    "department of medicaid officials have",
    "traveled the state and they've spoke to",
    "hundreds and hundreds of ohioans who",
    "were covered by medicaid to better",
    "understand",
    "what their actual experiences with",
    "medicaid have been",
    "and what their health outcomes have been",
    "we've also met with physicians hospitals",
    "health care providers managed care plans",
    "to hear",
    "their ideas about how we improve the",
    "delivery of health care",
    "and the health of ohioans",
    "from these conversations and this",
    "process",
    "we have developed a new plan a new",
    "vision",
    "for ohio's medicaid program one that",
    "focuses on people",
    "and not just focuses on the business of",
    "managed care",
    "a vision of what we hope will be a",
    "better",
    "healthier more productive state of ohio",
    "this is the first major overhaul of",
    "medicaid",
    "in 15 years",
    "in the coming days the department of",
    "medicaid will be rolling out a series of",
    "requests",
    "for applications for managed care plans",
    "to submit to us to help carry out this",
    "vision",
    "so this is this process will be rolling",
    "out in the next few days",
    "the department of medicaid is the",
    "largest provider of health insurance in",
    "the state of ohio",
    "medicaid covers 3 million ohioans",
    "of those nearly 90 percent are enrolled",
    "in a managed care plan including",
    "every nearly every child enrolled in",
    "medicaid in the state of ohio",

    "uh we'll we'll see what he says tonight",
    "but uh",
    "you know i think that um",
    "if you know if you look at what",
    "uh the president has done",
    "a major commitment and this is",
    "highlighted of course",
    "by his nomination judge barrett",
    "you know what candidate ever listed who",
    "he's going to",
    "put on the courts he did and uh",
    "you know he consistently put people who",
    "respect the constitution people who",
    "don't think they're legislators people",
    "who are are focused on being referees",
    "which is what we want judges to",

    "i think the president will carry ohio",
    "next question is from emily hamilton",
    "at wews in cleveland",
    "hi governor dewine um just going back",
    "now to",
    "our question last week we've been",
    "reporting on",
    "one nursing home specifically in lake",
    "county but",
    "i've you know started to receive",
    "complaints and other relatives reaching",
    "out",
    "nursing homes uh from really across the",
    "state and one of their main complaints",
    "is that they really struggle to get",
    "any information from nursing home staff",
    "about their relatives and",
    "and sometimes the last you know or the",
    "only point of contact they get",
    "is there toward the end when a hospice",
    "nurse tells them that their",
    "relative is contracted covered um",
    "and it it won't be much longer until",
    "they have unfortunately",
    "passed away i guess our question for you",
    "is what do you what's your response to",
    "these families who say they're really",
    "struggling to get",
    "information from nursing homes what more",
    "can be done to slow the spread at those",
    "facilities and",
    "what would you say to family members who",
    "are calling for",
    "some sort of state intervention aside",
    "from",
    "just inspections from the health",
    "department you know such as",
    "a lot of them calling for the state to",
    "send in the national guard at some of",
    "those facilities that they",
    "they weren't sent into beforehand",
    "well we don't we don't hesitate to send",
    "to the national guard where the national",
    "guard is is",
    "is needed and you know we do check with",
    "nursing homes if they have for example",
    "we had one nursing home",
    "a few weeks ago that",
    "a lot of their staff was off they",
    "couldn't staff it",
    "uh and so for a day or so we had",
    "national guard",
    "in there assisting them so we will we",
    "will send in the national guard we",
    "we we have doctors we have nurses we",
    "have people who",
    "you know in their civilian life do this",
    "and so they are members of the national",
    "guard so we don't hesitate to do that",
    "second as you may have seen the",
    "president made an announcement",
    "yesterday about new tests",
    "antigen tests that are quick tests",
    "and they are less intrusive",
    "and they also can be directly read you",
    "do not have to take them into a",
    "laboratory to get them read",
    "so we are looking now",
    "and coming up with a plan that we were",
    "working on today about how do we deploy",
    "these tests i mean these could be up to",
    "228 000 tests",
    "every shipment and that could you know",
    "that's going to enable us to do a lot of",
    "different things that we have not done",
    "in the past so we are looking",
    "for example at you know making that",
    "available",
    "to nursing homes to fill in gaps where",
    "the testing is not adequate",
    "enough or it's not frequent enough with",
    "staff for example",
    "we are also looking at using these tests",
    "as a extra layer of protection",
    "uh but also to give some people the",
    "nursing home confidence",
    "that the person who's coming in to visit",
    "a loved one",
    "does not have cobia so if you could get",
    "a test in 15 minutes",
    "and we don't have this worked out yet",
    "we're not ready to announce anything",
    "we're working with nursing homes to to",
    "talk with them and working with others",
    "uh but there's a possibility that we",
    "could use some of those tests",
    "to enable you to see your mother uh",
    "more often um i got a i got a",
    "letter uh yesterday um that was i think",
    "very eloquent from someone who's",
    "directly involved in nursing homes and",
    "and uh you know one things that she said",
    "was",
    "um you know when we have visitation",
    "sometimes we're short on staff and we",
    "can't we can't do it",
    "and that's what slows the visitation",
    "down and so i wanted to",
    "i wanted to mention that let me just",
    "finish that thought",
    "um you know we have opened up the",
    "nursing homes",
    "we are now coming forward with a plan",
    "about how do we deal with it",
    "in winter how do we deal with in house",
    "visitation one of the tools that we",
    "are going to deploy i believe is this",
    "additional testing",
    "which will be of assistance the other",
    "thing that you mentioned",
    "that you know i want to talk about for a",
    "moment um",
    "is is the sanitation and following",
    "infectious disease protocols",
    "you know we are reviewing these again",
    "internally to see whether or not frankly",
    "are we doing",
    "enough i always ask this question my",
    "team are we doing enough in this area",
    "are we doing enough in that area",
    "so we're having another review of what",
    "we're doing as far as the surveys the",
    "inspections",
    "that are going on in in in the nursing",
    "homes so",
    "go ahead you want the follow-up question",
    "my next question is from joe ingles at",
    "ohio public radio and television",
    "hello governor joe hi um",
    "many in our business community",
    "particularly bars and restaurants",
    "continue to say that they're having a",
    "real hard time",
    "making ends meet with the coronavirus",
    "mandates and restrictions that have been",
    "put on them",
    "and they question why some states like",
    "florida do not have the stiff",
    "restrictions yet they uh the ohio bars",
    "and restaurants",
    "uh have to continue with um you know the",
    "distance spacing and",
    "and all of the things that that make it",
    "harder for them",
    "to quite frankly make money and stay in",
    "business what would be",
    "your answer to those businesses right",
    "now",
    "who are saying why can't you ease up on",
    "this and give us some relief here",
    "well i have uh family members going back",
    "a",
    "few generations who ran bars and ran",
    "restaurants",
    "and i get it i i understand that",
    "i have close friends who run bars",
    "and i understand it uh and so i know",
    "this is tough",
    "for them uh let me point out",
    "one thing starting with restaurants uh",
    "the restaurant protocol",
    "was put together by people who run",
    "restaurants",
    "and one things that they said to me is",
    "we do not want a limit we don't want",
    "limit to how many people 25 percent some",
    "states went to 25",
    "some states went to 50 percent and they",
    "said look we will",
    "we will go by we will abide by the six",
    "foot rule",
    "but let us get as many people in there",
    "as we can abiding by the six foot rules",
    "now we did that now that obviously does",
    "constrain to some extent and it would",
    "vary by",
    "the makeup of the room or how big the",
    "room what angles the room has etc but we",
    "followed what they asked us to do",
    "uh in putting no 25 or no 50 percent",
    "there's no",
    "there's no limit on percentage it's",
    "limited by",
    "how close you can you can put you can",
    "put people",
    "um as far as the bars look i get it",
    "i understand that uh 10 o'clock closing",
    "with",
    "alcohol off the table by 11 is difficult",
    "um and gets into the directly in into",
    "their bottom line",
    "uh we're gonna we're gonna look at that",
    "we are looking at that we're in the",
    "process of looking at that",
    "i have mayors of some of our major",
    "cities",
    "who told me as recently as this morning",
    "please do not change that",
    "i have other another mayor who has told",
    "me please do change that",
    "but we have a lot of mayors who who",
    "don't think that this",
    "we should change this um i can't compare",
    "us to other states",
    "i don't know what other governors are",
    "doing i don't know what goes through",
    "their head i mean that's not",
    "you know my my responsibility my",
    "responsibility is to the people of the",
    "state of ohio and as the lieutenant",
    "governor pointed out",
    "you know we're trying to do two things",
    "we're trying to live with the virus",
    "we're trying to keep our economy moving",
    "we're trying to get people employed",
    "but at the same time we know that if",
    "this thing",
    "flares back up again then anybody going",
    "to have restaurants or bars",
    "because they'll be scared to do it we",
    "can't let it flare up and i would say",
    "and i'm bragging on the people of the",
    "state of ohio we've never had a big",
    "flare-up not a big one",
    "we've never been like florida was at one",
    "point texas was california was at one",
    "point",
    "um in south dakota you go on and on",
    "go through the different states we have",
    "not had that uh we've had great tragedy",
    "we've had people like",
    "continue to lose their lives we can't",
    "seem to get the number under a thousand",
    "by very much",
    "as far as new cases every day we've got",
    "hot spots certainly in the western side",
    "of our state so it's not perfect",
    "but we've done i think ohio ones",
    "ohio ones because of mass compliance and",
    "other things have done a very very good",
    "job",
    "at this what we constantly have to",
    "evaluate",
    "uh is you know exactly what you talked",
    "about which is",
    "hurt how this hurts small business",
    "uh versus what you know what it does",
    "if you expand the hours uh in regard to",
    "potential potential spread so we're",
    "looking at it",
    "uh we'll be talking about that in in a",
    "short period of time not",
    "not today one of the points that's been",
    "made very well from people",
    "is uh hey you know the baseball playoffs",
    "are on",
    "uh indians are on tonight for example",
    "you know nfl football's on a number of",
    "nights",
    "we have college football that's on and",
    "so there's ample",
    "opportunity for people to stay in a bar",
    "you know",
    "eat what they want to eat drink what",
    "they want to drink and watch the games",
    "that go on in",
    "into the night and so i fully i fully",
    "understand that",
    "uh we will we will try to have something",
    "shortly and kind of tell you where we",
    "are on this as we",
    "we continue to evaluate how we how we do",
    "this",
    "next question is from andrew welsh",
    "huggins at the associated press",
    "hi governor um apologies for the",
    "background noise we've got a",
    "construction project in the neighborhood",
    "this is a bit of a follow-up to joe's",
    "question and and this may actually be",
    "more for the lieutenant governor",
    "but um in terms of the economy we we did",
    "see last week that initial claims for",
    "unemployment compensation ticked up",
    "slightly uh as did continuing claims",
    "which are considered",
    "i guess a more reliable indicator of the",
    "jobs situation",
    "and lieutenant governor talked about",
    "some good news",
    "but you know nationally 40 000 workers",
    "in the airline industry are facing",
    "layoffs thursday",
    "uh just today the dayton daily news",
    "reported that uh",
    "pf chang's china bistro was laying off",
    "299 workers across the state with",
    "restaurants continuing to suffer",
    "so i guess i'm just wondering with what",
    "you've been talking about uh what you",
    "just",
    "talked about and what the lieutenant",
    "governor has been talking about you know",
    "what are your concerns that",
    "as we've recovered from that huge",
    "economic downward swing",
    "we could be facing you know a longer",
    "term decline",
    "and again what can be done about that",
    "short of additional reopenings",
    "uh or a vaccine well",
    "absolutely the right questions question",
    "we ask ourselves every every day",
    "uh we're talking to the legislature",
    "we hope to have an announcement with the",
    "legislature with the leaders",
    "shortly about some specific help for",
    "small businesses",
    "and some specific help in regard to uh",
    "people to pay rent uh which directly",
    "impacts the people who are paying the",
    "rent",
    "but also you know someone who might own",
    "the",
    "own the property and who is paying a",
    "mortgage themselves so",
    "you know has a real significant impact",
    "um",
    "and second to people who have mortgages",
    "so those are three things that were",
    "we're looking at right now",
    "uh talking to the general assembly and i",
    "think",
    "we'll be able to announce something i",
    "hope in the in the in the near future",
    "about what we can do uh in regard to",
    "those those three things",
    "um lieutenant governor i don't know if",
    "you have anything to add to that",
    "yeah yeah governor andrew it's a good",
    "question",
    "we certainly know that we have a long",
    "way to go",
    "but we know that finding that right",
    "balance on the health and economic",
    "consequences is essential to do",
    "so that people have confidence to go out",
    "to go back to work and to do those kinds",
    "of things so it's it's the",
    "it's the balance we're trying to strike",
    "there's a lot of disruption in the",
    "economy",
    "where some types of traditional",
    "businesses",
    "are laying off and will continue to lay",
    "off and i expect we will continue to see",
    "those announcements",
    "for some time as other businesses",
    "are hiring uh for example i saw the",
    "other day where amazon i think amazon's",
    "trying to hire over 3000 people",
    "in the state of ohio at the same times",
    "that other types of businesses",
    "perhaps who don't fit into the coveted",
    "world as well",
    "are laying people off there is an",
    "intense disruption",
    "that exists in the economy that's why",
    "you hear",
    "like we did today announcing about",
    "retraining opportunities",
    "because the types of jobs in our economy",
    "are changing",
    "and they will permanently in many cases",
    "and so that's why we gotta",
    "we gotta continue to upskill people",
    "that's what the imap announcement was",
    "about today",
    "taking people who are unemployed uh",
    "getting them retrained so that they",
    "they can they can do uh a lot of the new",
    "jobs that are being created and i want",
    "to",
    "i want to emphasize something when we",
    "talk about technology",
    "um these are these skills if you're not",
    "if you don't consider yourself a tech",
    "person believe me you can still be",
    "retrained to do these things",
    "the these are you don't you don't even",
    "have to have a tech background",
    "because to be able to enroll in some of",
    "these programs and get a new skill so",
    "please if you're out there in the",
    "workforce don't be intimidated by this",
    "i know that there's some support",
    "services out there to get you skilled to",
    "get you into the workforce",
    "uh and for all of us to adjust to the",
    "changes that are",
    "in the disruptions that are occurring in",
    "the economy a lot of these trends were",
    "already underway coveted exacerbated",
    "them",
    "and we're just having to respond to that",
    "and help",
    "matching help get people skills and",
    "match them to the new kinds of jobs that",
    "are being created",
    "thank you next question is from",
    "jackie borchardt at the cincinnati",
    "enquirer",
    "good afternoon governor i won't have a",
    "follow-up on the",
    "abbott testing it's been almost two",
    "months since",
    "you announced the six-state compact to",
    "require antigen tests",
    "how come we don't have a plan yet on how",
    "to implement these tests",
    "with yesterday's announcements as you're",
    "still working on it what is",
    "what are you really um looking at to",
    "uh to come up with that plan and why",
    "what are some of the concerns about",
    "using these particular tests",
    "well thank you for the question uh first",
    "of all you know this is",
    "big news um this is separate and apart",
    "uh you know from any consortium that",
    "we're involved in",
    "and we've known that these tests were",
    "coming for some time as",
    "the president has told us that they were",
    "coming the vice president has told us",
    "they were coming",
    "so we know a lot of different places",
    "where we're going to deploy them",
    "and we have two goals we have two goals",
    "uh",
    "one is to save lives and that means you",
    "have to target",
    "those who are the most vulnerable which",
    "are the older ohioans and ohioans who",
    "have",
    "a medical problem that's where you save",
    "the lives",
    "second though we have to do everything",
    "we can to slow the spread",
    "and to slow the spread um",
    "that that is vitally important and so",
    "those those two things third thing is",
    "you know if we",
    "can use these tests to let ohioans",
    "uh more fully participate in",
    "their life society",
    "then we want to use them in that way too",
    "for example",
    "we were talking that we were working",
    "this morning on about the deployment of",
    "some of these tests",
    "possibly into schools into the local",
    "health department",
    "so the local health department could",
    "work with the schools",
    "and again these are strip tests uh these",
    "are these are look",
    "some similar concept broadly as a",
    "pregnancy test you don't have to take",
    "them to the laboratory",
    "it takes 15 minutes to get the results",
    "so we're looking",
    "we don't have anything to announce but",
    "we're looking at how could we use these",
    "to get more kids physically in school uh",
    "maybe kids who are online now and maybe",
    "some way we could use them in that",
    "manner or",
    "or when kids who are in school now",
    "physically",
    "and one of the candidly one of the",
    "complaints we've heard and one of the",
    "concerns that has",
    "been raised is you know you have a child",
    "who tests positive",
    "and then you knock out a whole bunch of",
    "other kids maybe there's a way",
    "to use these tests in regard to these",
    "other kids",
    "so that they would not have to be",
    "knocked out for 14 days",
    "so you know that's some of the things",
    "that we're looking at we're looking at",
    "using some of these tests in our jails",
    "you know our jails many times do not",
    "have testing",
    "and being able that's a congregate",
    "setting it's a setting you worry about",
    "they're either going to go back out into",
    "society",
    "you don't want them taking that out into",
    "society you don't want them taking it to",
    "the state",
    "prison system so managing",
    "helping sheriffs manage their jail",
    "population certainly is",
    "is important uh we also have",
    "um other congregate living out there uh",
    "that we could use and deploy these so",
    "we're well on our way with the plan",
    "we're not ready to announce it yet",
    "we want to talk to some of the people",
    "who are going to be deploying it",
    "but we're very excited about this uh",
    "this is a this is a big",
    "big deal we've known it's been coming",
    "but now with these additional tests",
    "it's going to be very helpful",
    "next question is from jack windsor at",
    "wmfd",
    "in mansfield hi jack hi governor",
    "last week a marietta mom was violently",
    "removed from a stadium",
    "after she was asked to mask and didn't",

    "exemption was not going to be honored by",
    "the school",
    "and the school also questioned her",
    "religious exemption",
    "asking for documentation from a church",
    "leader and materials that would",
    "establish the existence of long-standing",
    "beliefs essentially the school is now",
    "adjudicating which religious beliefs are",
    "valid",
    "which are not so my question is governor",
    "should schools simply be honoring",
    "exemptions allowed in the sports order",
    "and the statewide mass mandate from july",
    "23rd",
    "why or why not well we created the",
    "exemption",
    "um to take care of",
    "seriously held beliefs that would",
    "prohibit someone from",
    "wearing a mask and it came about in a",
    "conversation that i had with a",
    "superintendent",
    "where the superintendent said we have",
    "people in our community",
    "and you know they",
    "for religious reasons do not want to",
    "feel that they cannot wear a mask",
    "that sounds that sounds reasonable uh",
    "throughout this",
    "we have we've tried to you know be very",
    "respectful",
    "of people's religion uh you know we",
    "never closed the churches",
    "we never ever ever did that at all",
    "and so we put this religious exemption",
    "in there",
    "um you know we have 630 some school",
    "districts we have private schools",
    "and so each one of them you know has to",
    "make a a determination",
    "i can't make a determination in these",
    "cases uh",
    "i think our superintendents are doing a",
    "good job i think our principals are",
    "doing a good job and they're making a",
    "case-by-case",
    "determination of what you know",
    "what they can do your question is you",
    "know",
    "what you don't want to have is a",
    "situation where you",
    "just say to people look if you just want",
    "to say it's really",
    "you know all you have to do is check",
    "this box and you don't you don't have to",
    "wear a mask",
    "that's that's not going to accomplish",
    "what we need to accomplish",
    "we don't have to have everybody wearing",
    "a mask",
    "but we have to have a very very",
    "significant",
    "number of them and we've seen time and",
    "time again",
    "out in society out in different counties",
    "that that does make a huge",
    "you know huge huge difference",
    "and so this is something i trust our",
    "local",
    "schools um and they have leeway in this",
    "and we're not going to second",
    "second-guess them we're not going to",
    "tell them they were wrong",
    "we tried to give them broad guidance so",
    "that we could say to parents",
    "and we could say to schools if you go",
    "back in person",
    "um that you the if you follow these",
    "guidelines",
    "this is it's the safest way that you can",
    "do this",
    "and let me just say they're doing a",
    "bang-up job",
    "they're doing a very very very good job",
    "in managing a difficult",
    "situation my hat's off to the",
    "superintendents",
    "the principals the teachers parents",
    "i think by and large everyone is doing a",
    "very very good job in a very difficult",
    "environment",
    "next question is from mike livingston at",
    "gongwar news service",
    "hey uh governor um you kind of alluded",
    "this talking",
    "about nursing homes but with colder",
    "weather coming what other conversations",
    "are you having with your team on how the",
    "state's approach might need to adjust",
    "once everybody heads indoors for the",
    "winter thanks",
    "well we don't know",
    "you know where this covets going uh and",
    "we continue to learn things i say we",
    "look i'm not",
    "i'm not the scientist i'm not the",
    "medical person uh but i'm talking about",
    "the experts and they continue to learn",
    "um we're putting a real push on",
    "flu shots because we don't know what",
    "happens if someone has coveted flu but",
    "we don't want to find out",
    "and so the more that we can reduce that",
    "number uh people who get",
    "the flu the more that we can reduce the",
    "severity of the flu",
    "we know that that will save lives flu",
    "can be deadly particularly to the young",
    "particularly to the old",
    "and so it's the right thing to do we",
    "hope",
    "that what they've seen in the southern",
    "hemisphere some countries in the",
    "southern",
    "southern hemisphere where they've",
    "already had the flu season",
    "um that the wearing of the mass cut down",
    "the spread of that but we",
    "we don't know the other thing that we",
    "are looking at i have a",
    "working group uh and we've not talked",
    "about this i don't think",
    "but i put a working group together to",
    "look at",
    "um what our director",
    "drc was talking about what annette was",
    "talking about and that is",
    "ventilation and you know what we do",
    "in our public buildings and what we can",
    "do",
    "as people move back inside and they're",
    "inside",
    "virtually all the time the importance of",
    "that ventilation",
    "being right bringing in outside air uh",
    "making sure you have the the right",
    "filters in place",
    "all of those things are very very",
    "important we do have us",
    "you know we had an expert from ohio",
    "state who was talked a week or so ago",
    "here",
    "and we're consulting with him and we're",
    "going to continue to work",
    "on that so that's another thing that",
    "we're working on",
    "as we move into the colder colder",
    "weather in ohio",
    "next question is from max philby at the",
    "columbus dispatch",
    "hey governor max uh",
    "so it sounds like uh that may was one of",
    "the deadliest months for",
    "opioid overdoses in ohio um",
    "and moving forward i'm just curious what",
    "what will your administration be doing",
    "to try to curb that",
    "make sure that we don't see another",
    "record month here before the end of the",
    "year",
    "yeah we're putting a real focus um uh",
    "with director",
    "chris uh on on that and on",
    "mental health uh many times those are",
    "are connected uh we know that",
    "um there's been a lot of downsides to",
    "this covet",
    "besides the coven and one of the",
    "downsides",
    "is an increase in mental health we're",
    "again",
    "working with the state legislature and i",
    "hope to have some announcement",
    "coming shortly uh you know in regard to",
    "mental health and more that we can do in",
    "this area to help our colleges our",
    "universities to help our",
    "high schools our grade schools i mean",
    "fortunately",
    "you know our k-12 schools have wellness",
    "dollars",
    "that the legislature set aside we work",
    "with the legislature and they",
    "did that so those wellness dollars can",
    "be",
    "used in regard to the in regard to",
    "mental health but it's something we're",
    "very aware of",
    "we're seeing it out in the communities",
    "getting more",
    "dollars out to the local communities is",
    "something that's",
    "that's very important so we'll have more",
    "to announce next several",
    "weeks next question is from ben schwartz",
    "at wcpo in cincinnati",
    "hey ben hi governor",
    "um i'm wondering if you've at all",
    "considered loosening",
    "truancy laws in ohio schools or",
    "possibly requiring districts with kids",
    "who are feeling ill",
    "to offer the option of virtual learning",
    "whenever they need just so kids don't",
    "necessarily",
    "excuse me so kids who don't necessarily",
    "know if they have covet 19",
    "but might feel ill don't potentially",
    "spread the virus at school",
    "well that's an excellent question we",
    "really want to encourage schools to do",
    "that",
    "um and you know if if we're starting to",
    "get into a problem",
    "um i'm sure the schools are going to",
    "tell us because we",
    "in regard to absentee",
    "um and there's something that we need to",
    "do at the state level",
    "in regard to that uh but by and large",
    "this is we leave this up to the local",
    "schools",
    "again if there's guidelines or if there",
    "are regulations that we need to change",
    "because of the cova",
    "that's causing that kind of problem then",
    "i'm sure then we're certainly willing to",
    "willing to take a look at that because",
    "we don't want children who don't feel",
    "good",
    "coming to class uh and you know i",
    "noticed that schools that have",
    "done the hybrid one one of the things",
    "that uh",
    "they can do or most of them i think can",
    "do is make that switch a little easier",
    "back and forth",
    "and you know hybrid means a lot of",
    "different things to a lot of different",
    "different schools but some schools child",
    "it's on for a couple days off for a",
    "couple days",
    "but they get used to you know using that",
    "that remote learning so again",
    "i think those schools probably have a",
    "easier time to make that",
    "that transition but we're open to doing",
    "anything we need to do to help them",
    "next question is from kenny bass at wchs",
    "in charleston west virginia",
    "hi governor we've seen in our state and",
    "obviously in eastern kentucky and",
    "southern ohio that a one-size-fits-all",
    "approach doesn't really work",
    "when dealing with covid so can you",
    "communicate to the people who live",
    "in our region which is rural and in many",
    "ways much more similar to kentucky and",
    "west virginia than some of your more",
    "metropolitan areas like cincinnati",
    "cleveland",
    "athens akron et cetera the differences",
    "in governing this thing",
    "in those areas and the challenges the",
    "state is going through to try to",
    "be as effective as possible in these",
    "vastly different communities",
    "well one of the great things about ohio",
    "is we have many different communities we",
    "have our appalachian communities we have",
    "our cities we have our suburbs",
    "you know different all kinds of",
    "different uh parts parts of ohio",
    "and um you know i've traveled ohio and",
    "my wife fran has quite a bit in the last",
    "30 or 40 years so",
    "we we get it we get that we get the",
    "difference i i think when you're talking",
    "about a small rural county",
    "we still have some counties that don't",
    "have a lot of spread",
    "one of the reasons we put this this list",
    "up up on the board with 88",
    "counties you know we can kind of see",
    "everybody can look and see what their",
    "spread is in their county on thursday in",
    "fact",
    "we're going to put some more data up",
    "we're going to put for the month of",
    "september",
    "you know how how many people have been",
    "coming out of cases",
    "that actual number what the number is of",
    "hospitalization so far",
    "what the number of of deaths are and so",
    "we're going to try to",
    "continue to give people information so i",
    "would say you know anyone who's in your",
    "viewing",
    "area should try to",
    "continue to drill down what's going on",
    "in their county",
    "and how many cases they've had and what",
    "kind of",
    "report and we have we have the virus",
    "everywhere so you can't hide from it",
    "but there's certainly some counties in",
    "southeast ohio for example",
    "uh that are not as high as many many of",
    "our other counties are but i think",
    "people need to look at their own",
    "individual county",
    "um wearing the mask whether you're in a",
    "rural county or urban county",
    "is just a way to dramatically slow this",
    "so if you're in a county where you don't",
    "have a lot of",
    "a lot of spread yet you can keep it away",
    "i mean it's pretty simple eighty ninety",
    "percent of people wear a mask you're",
    "gonna keep it away",
    "you're gonna keep it way way way way",
    "down and it's so much easier to keep it",
    "down",
    "than when it gets up to here and it's",
    "spreading out like it's spreading out",
    "like that",
    "and that's that's a problem so that",
    "would be my message wear a mask",
    "keep it down keep a distance",
    "i think that's the best way to deal with",
    "it governor next",
    "question is the last question for today",
    "and it belongs to shane stegmiller of",
    "hannah news service",
    "good afternoon governor how are you",
    "doing um",
    "the legislature sent you house bill 242",
    "which prohibits local",
    "governments from placing taxes on",
    "containers such as single-use plastic",
    "bags",
    "you've expressed concerns about it in",
    "the past",
    "i just wanted to see what your thoughts",
    "are on the bill currently and going",
    "forward",
    "because i believe it's just a temporary",
    "ban",
    "yes this is a temporary ban",
    "and i will sign the bill because it's",
    "temporary and because",
    "i think you can make an argument for it",
    "during the covet",
    "period it covers for example styrofoam",
    "people can carry out food etc",
    "so it's not just the paper bags my",
    "general principle",
    "is unless there's a compelling reason",
    "why we need uniformity throughout the",
    "state of ohio",
    "that we should stay away from",
    "telling local units of government what",
    "to do",
    "they're elected by the local citizens",
    "there should be accountable to the local",
    "citizens",
    "if the local citizens don't like what",
    "they're doing they can get rid of them",
    "um so if something uh",
    "unless there's a compelling reason to do",
    "it uh",
    "i would normally veto this bill uh but",
    "we are in the covent",
    "uh period i think it makes sense during",
    "this period of time",
    "have that uniformity and that assurance",
    "that people have this",
    "um ability to you to use",
    "styrofoam uh containers to have carry",
    "out food and",
    "to use uh the plastic bags so",
    "i will sign the bill but",
    "when i get another bill in a year or so",
    "like that i probably won't sign it",
    "i'm told that we are done and so let me",
    "just do",
    "uh something kind of fun i want to",
    "spotlight",
    "uh really some everyday heroes you know",
    "them they're out there",
    "uh maybe you're one of them but you",
    "probably see them every day and they're",
    "doing the best they can to get us",
    "through this pandemic uh some of them",
    "are shining light for others we call",
    "them",
    "heroes of hope uh here's one that we'd",
