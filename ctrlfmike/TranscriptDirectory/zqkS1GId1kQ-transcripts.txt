um
well good afternoon everyone fran uh
made me this ohio mask ohio made mask
we're in the necktie today if you can
see it ohio dominican
john o'grady franklin county
commissioner is a grad
on tuesday fran talked about the ohio
governor's imagination library being
now almost a year old we continue our
mission to provide a
free book once a month for children
under the age of
five in the last 48 hours
since fran talked about it
4 600 kids more kids have been signed up
so we're very happy
about that we invite anyone to sign your
kids up
sign your grandkids up a great great
thing
we now have close to 200 000 children
in ohio who were enrolled you can just
go to the website
ohio imagination library.org that's ohio
imaginationlibrary.org
mercer van wert and crawford counties
coming in
september we still have
eight counties that are not
covered county-wide
so three counties as i said have stepped
up
and come on board since uh just tuesday
van wort crawford and mercer county as
you'll see on here
they are in green and you'll see also
the other counties that are not yet
covered
uh are in blue oh excuse me the ones
that are covered are in blue
uh the ones that are in white are not
yet
covered so those are ottawa richland
ashland columbiana lake
sandusky and seneca counties and so
we're looking for partners
and what partnership means is really
it's two different things
two different groups usually one group
to take the applications
and and to make sure that everyone knows
what's going on and the other is to
provide the
the matching funding uh which is needed
uh so the state legislature uh has
stepped up in the last budget uh and
provides half the money
the other half the money comes from the
local the local community so again
we need partners in ottawa richland
ashland columbiana lake sandusky and
seneca
counties if you can help or want more
information about what it means to
partner
with us please contact us through our
website at ohio imaginationlibrary.org
we'll go eric now to our data slides
what we're seeing today we've actually
this is up this is a number of cases in
the last 24 hours we had three straight
days
uh i believe was under a thousand um
and so we were liking that a lot uh but
now it's
it's flipped it's flipped back up here
number of deaths
tragically 22 in the last 24 hours have
been reported
uh hospitalizations uh 86 running about
the same as it's been for
21 day average the same for icu
emissions a little bit up
but pretty much pretty much the same
so that's the the data slides uh let's
move
uh to our new go to the next slide eric
these are our counties uh ranked uh
by incidents of covid in the last
14 days uh and by
um 100 000. so this is
the map we continue to show you we
showed you on tuesday this is updated a
little bit
but pretty much the same let's go eric
to the top 10 of those counties
so you'll see again as we pointed out on
tuesday
these counties are some actually some of
our smaller counties
mercer county has actually come down a
little bit but still at a very very high
level
and then dark county is next lawrence
county
uh preble county preble is is up there
now
meigs county sandusky shelby auglaise
erie
uh county and then perry county so again
most of these are relatively small
counties in our rural parts of the state
so
what has happened is that we've seen the
urban areas
uh that a bigger percentage of people
are wearing masks
for a longer period of time and we've
seen those numbers come down
unfortunately we're seeing the numbers
go up uh in our
rural areas let's turn to the public
health alert system
this is where we were last week
this is where we are today and you'll
see
you'll see some changes and some things
that we're very happy about and some
things
that we're not happy about this week we
have
nine red counties the lowest number of
red counties since we started the alert
system eight weeks ago so that's good
four new counties have turned red
since last week and not and seven though
dropped off the red list the four new
counties that are read are clark
lorraine preble and trumbull
they joined claremont erie franklin
lucas and mercer county we'll go through
these
the seven counties that drop from red to
orange which is great
off the red list now uh brown county and
southern ohio
cuyahoga county fairfield county licking
marion montgomery and muskingum
and as you know montgomery and cuyahoga
have been
on that red list every single week and
they now drop off and so that is great
some additional good news six counties
dropped from orange to yellow
they are highland huron jefferson morgan
richland and ross counties
let's let's go back now and look at the
at the red at the red counties
quickly and these are in the order
in which we have them
based upon cases per hundred thousand
residents in the last two weeks
mercer county uh stays read this week
because of their high number of cases
they are two and a half times
what the what's considered by the cdc is
a high
incidence uh they're starting to see a
decrease in case numbers which is good
but they still have the highest number
of cases
per capita in the state their
hospitalizations have decreased and
they're continuing to monitor the
small outbreaks but spread throughout
the county
preble county is read for the first time
they meet the cdc's threshold for high
incidents and again they're at 173 so
they're
way over that they had 71 new cases
during the past two weeks
that compares to a total of 269 for the
whole pandemic so
basically 25 of their cases have arisen
in the last
uh two weeks uh erie county erie meets
two indicators but they continue to meet
the cdc's threshold for f
high incidence they're at 129. they had
96 cases during the past two weeks
a large outbreak in a long-term care
facility is responsible for a
significant number of cases
however there does continue to be
community spread throughout the county
franklin county uh franklin is edging
down
and we hope next week that they're no
longer read but they're red because
of their 109 cases per hundred thousand
um even though franklin still meets the
cdc threshold
their cases as i said have in fact been
dropping
they've seen a small increase in
emergency department visits
from 21 visits a day on august 9th to 30
on august 16th
however their outpatient visits have
leveled off
um let me talk about lucas county uh
lucas continues red but it is almost
out of the red again that is good they
have
they they have 102 cases per hundred
thousand
um they have gone from an average of 22
outpatient visits per day on august 11th
to 29 on august 16th
they also meet the cdc threshold for
high incidents
however this number as i said has
dropped it was at 159
it's now 102 for the past two weeks
clark county uh clark county is
returning to red
level this week because they meet four
indicators and the cdc's threshold for
high incidents they are at 102. they've
had 137 new cases during the past two
weeks
from august 5th to august 17th the
number of
outpatient visits for covet have almost
gone up almost four times from 11 today
to 41 per day
cases are linked to multiple multiple
small workplace
outbreaks and a couple of long-term care
facilities the number of small
outbreaks suggests that there is spread
throughout the community
lorraine county is read for the first
time this week
a particular notice their outpatient
visits grew from an
average of 20 a day on august 7th to
almost 28
within a week their cases per day went
from an average of 18 or august 4th to
24 on august 11th
they are seeing fewer workplace
outbreaks but they're continuing to see
communities spread this spread is
primarily
we're seeing in social situations family
gatherings where people are
unmasked and in close contact and
basically let their guard down
clermont county clermont county uh
remains read this week the county meets
five indicators we'll continue to keep
an eye
on numbers in clermont county
although there are limited small
outbreaks the majority of spread is in
the community
and health officials told us they're
seeing household transmissions
tremble county unfortunately is
returning back to red this week the
county went from an average of nine
cases per day on august 7th
to 13 cases per day on august 12th
they've had 115 cases during the past
two two weeks they've had a couple of
large outbreaks and long-term care
facilities involving employees and
residents
the majority of the spread is happening
within households according to local
health
department officials so what we've seen
again is the shift
a fundamental shift from the
we're not seeing the increases now in
the urban uh it's going down
primarily in urban and we're seeing it
going up in the rule
um let me
talk about some examples um and we
again we use these examples not to shame
anybody
or to be critical of anyone but just to
kind of is is
illustrative of how we're seeing seeing
spread now
uh in in ohio in logan county at the end
of july there was an outbreak associated
with a jazzercise
class although the studio followed
recommended protective measures for when
people weren't exercising
masks were allowed to be removed while
exercising
there are now 10 cases tied to the
outbreak including one person
very sadly who is an icu
wood county a sports team had a
sleepover at a team member's house and
now there are nine
confirmed cases um
just remind our athletes as we talked
about on tuesday that what they do
away from practice what they do away
from the from the competition
is just vitally important um
let me turn to uh city of kent
uh restaurant where bart bartender was
observed to be not wearing a mask at
work the manager of the restaurant said
there were
health exceptions that's how it was
explained bartender became sick with
symptoms
had three roommates boyfriend also
tested positive
so this is just not a not a good
situation eric let's look at the
education
slide this is a slide that we showed the
other day this is a this is revised
and let's do a slide over here and again
what is boxed or
counties that are red so the red outline
that means that county is
is now a red county um inside that
you'll see the different school
districts
and so if it is uh they're going to do
it fully
remote it's the darkest color up there i
guess that's a dark blue
if it's hybrid there's this light or
this
that color of blue and then this is
green and that is the green is those
that are full
of returning they plan to return fully
to class
uh in person class and we only show that
up there
uh just to alert people if that's your
district
uh and you're going back and to class
and your
county is a red county obviously the
spread does go into the schools
uh so you're gonna have to be extra
extra careful it's gonna be important
that everyone in the community try to do
everything they can to reduce
the incidence of spread in the community
i'm convinced from talking to many many
superintendents
and school officials and teachers that
the schools are going to do a very good
job
uh trying to keep our kids safe when
they go back to school
but if there is significant spread in
that community
it's impossible to keep it out of that
school
so we all have to work together everyone
in the community
particularly in the schools that are
going back in person
if we want to keep our kids going in
person we've got to get the spread of
covet down
in in the community i want to
address a very troubling thing that we
have seen
reported in our newspapers over the last
week
or so and something that i've talked
about before
but it's gun violence um let me start
the akron beacon journal um here are the
headlines
family grieving again just a
gut-wrenching story
on friday an eight-year-old girl was
shot and killed when someone opened fire
on a backyard birthday party
and she was not the mom's first child to
die tragically
so our heart goes out to the family
toledo blade
teen shot killed in central toledo marks
ninth homicide
in in august
young man 15 years old 15 years old
high school sophomore shot killed while
out in his neighborhood
sunday night let's go eric to the
cincinnati enquirer
four dead and city senseless night of
violence
multiple shootings injured 17 police id
4 killed this is a
reference to saturday night sunday
morning in cincinnati
19 people 19 were shot
four of them killed in multiple
shootings overnight
by our unofficial tally we've counted a
total of 56 people
shot across ohio 17 of them killed from
friday august 14th through today
and these are just the cases that we
were able to find
in the news 17
sons fathers daughters brothers sisters
who are now gone forever to their
families
17 families who will carry the weight of
their losses
for the rest of their lives
little michaela pickett eight-year-old
girl killed in akron
will never graduate from high school
never walk down the aisle
never know the joy of being a parent
she and her family are robbed of all the
incredible joys that life has to offer
just absolutely unbelievable why
so someone angry someone was looking to
sell a score or something at the party
well we don't know
but it's a horrible horrible tragedy
eight-year-old girl in akron 15 year old
boy in toledo
four people killed saturday sunday in
cincinnati
enough is enough we know and i know
from talking to law enforcement from
talking to chiefs of police
that many of these
cases we can almost bet that many of
these cases
were committed with handguns those
handguns
we have found in the past many times are
stolen
many times they're legally obtained and
certainly many times the perpetrator
is not legally allowed to have these
guns because that person is a convicted
felon
it's not a new problem we want to reduce
gun violence
we have to deal with a relatively small
number of people chiefs
have told me time and time again
relatively small number of people
in our cities in our communities who
carry out this violence
week after week if we could remove them
and if we had removed them
maybe some of these children would be
alive today
we have legislation that is pending in
the general assembly
that works on this
it will matter it will make a big
difference
our bill will get tougher on those
who've committed a crime with a gun
people who have no absolutely no right
to have a gun
you'll get tougher on those found
carrying a weapon if they're legally
prohibited
from doing so increase the penalty for
knowingly providing a gun to a minor or
to someone who is legally prohibited
from owning guns
our legislation would ensure that
warrants on dangerous warrant offenders
are in law enforcement databases so that
officers all
the state all over the country have the
information they need to arrest those
who've committed violent crimes
hopefully before someone else gets hurt
each one of these cases that
i'm referencing um
example of just needless violence
um i'm asking uh my friends in the
general assembly to
to take a look at this uh this is
something that i don't think is
controversial
these are people who are not allowed to
have a gun
i think there's a general consensus in
society that those individuals who are
not allowed to have a gun and who are
repeat
violent offenders need to be removed
from society
well we're getting ready for school to
start
and today i'd like to bring in a couple
of the people who are very very much
involved in
getting our kids ready and then we'll be
when school goes back
there they'll be dealing with the
children
trying to provide them a great education
and
so we've selected two people one
whose school district is going remote
distance learning and the other is going
to do it
in person as i've said fran i have
grandkids some are going back
in person some will be doing it remotely
first let me welcome dr david james
dr james recently celebrated his
12th year as superintendent of akron
public schools
his unyielding advocate for his students
akron will be bringing students back
fully online
for the first nine weeks of the year and
i've asked
dr james to really share with us kind of
what his aspirations are and his team's
aspirations and what uh
how they think that this is going to
work doctor thank you very much for
for joining us appreciate it thank you
and good afternoon governor
dewine yes we will be starting our
school year with 100
remote learning for that first nine
weeks our district implemented
one-to-one technology
with uh chromebooks about four years ago
so all of our students have the
technology to access our google
classroom format
and we're using the lessons learned from
our virtual experience in the spring
to prepare for this remote start the
issue with summit county is we have
several zip codes in our district that
have
some of the highest rates in our county
of cobit spread
and so the board and i thought it would
be prudent to start off our year
remotely and then make an adjustment as
we monitor
uh through the data the department of
health provides and our local summit
county health department
provides us as well so this fall we'll
have a more structured schedule for
students
with set times to start their day with
virtual morning meetings with their
teachers
we've allocated time for virtual art
music and physical activity
direct instruction virtually breaks
including
lunch are built into their schedule
along with individual and group learning
time
and we've also allotted time in the
schedule for parents and students to get
any technology help that students may
need
well that's great doctor thank you thank
you very much so so let's
let's say i'm a parent i've got i've got
a student
so that student will will have a
schedule uh that they'll have they'll
know that their classes
what time do classes start uh roughly
between 8 30 and 9 we have a different
schedule for elementary middle and high
school
so let's say my child is in first grade
so brand new experience
i mean they were in kindergarten but
this is a new experience
what's their day look like let's say
they start at 8 30 or 9.
uh are they are they then looking at the
teacher
uh on on their screen is that how this
is working
yes they will be looking at their
teacher um at the elementary level we're
really focusing on
english and math instruction and then
we'll have some
uh additional activities for them
including uh
packets of hands-on materials that they
can use as part of their instructional
experiences
as well and is there an opportunity then
for interaction with that teacher
and what about interaction with their
fellow classmates who
they haven't seen yet yes so um part of
the day will be spent with direct
instruction with the teacher so
the teacher will be able to see the
students they'll be able to see the
teacher
and then there are times where we'll
have group activities
and um various individuals who will also
help uh
uh with those group activities with the
kids
though it's all done virtually
and doctor you talked about um physical
activity
you talked about music maybe art how
does that
uh how how does how does that work work
out how do you do that how do you do the
physical
so with our um our physical education
teachers there'll be times when they'll
engage the students you know in terms of
not necessarily in the gym but being
able to stand up move around they may
dance they may do
some you know basic calisthenics but
those are things that we really felt
were important while kids are at home
learning but to be able to do those
types of things
with our physical education teachers
leading that part of their school day
and so if i'm if i'm a child looking at
that screen
will i see the other students there as
well or i just see the teacher
how does that work yeah with our system
there will be the opportunity as they
have tiles across the top or the side of
the screen
they should be able to see each other as
well and
for those who don't know what a
chromebook is tell us what that is
well a chromebook basically um just has
the google chrome software on it
and it's a great device ours have um you
know the built-in cameras we're gonna
get
actual head uh phones and mics for
the students but it is a simple device
but
uh fairly robust in terms of how we need
to deliver instruction
that's great doctor thanks for sharing
good luck to you and
your teachers and your whole your whole
team and we appreciate your time very
very much and thanks
thanks for dedicating your life to young
people thank you
thanks doctor i've also invited a
superintendent to join us today who is
approaching the start of the school year
a little differently jeff greenlee has
been superintendent of beltry city
schools
washington county since 2019
for that he was in the switzerland
school district um
jeff what's uh return to school going to
look like
uh for you all hello governor and uh
thanks for letting me come on and talk a
little bit about the great work that
my team here at belfrey's done to
prepare for a five-day uh in-person
experience so
we're grateful to you for the
flexibility that you gave us in local
decision making
and we've been hyper focused on our
local cova 19 data
i was just relieved to see that we're
still yellow earlier today
we're hyper focused on our local
families our local peers
our local health department as we as
we've made our
determination so early on we partnered
closely with the washington county
superintendents there's a
real tradition here of working closely
together and
we paired up with the experts at the
washington county health department and
the marietta developer health department
and what started as monthly has now
become
weekly zoom meetings with those experts
and we have worked very
closely together to collaborate and make
joint plans and and share some
uh you know best practices so you know
our board of education tasked me to to
listen to our community
we spent a great deal of time with
families and focus groups listening to
their concerns
what was uh interesting to me is that
the concerns of our elementary parents
were different than our high school
parents even
even within our our school district so
after we heard concerns and listened
carefully
we engaged with uh our faculty and our
staff
and empowered them gave them a seat at
the table to think about
if we're going to bring our students
back five days a week um you know how
can we do that in a safe way so
that's ultimately what we've done and i
think like most districts if we
become a level three or a level four
county uh we're prepared to dial back
um at the same time we've also allowed
families that may
have not felt comfortable about
returning or have a higher risk
or someone their family has a higher
risk a virtual option
our our ohio valley educational service
center led by
superintendent annie brooks helped
negotiate a consortium partner that's
serving all of our school districts in
in this area for high school students
and then you know we usually have
four teachers per grade level in our
elementary and three of them will be in
person and one will be virtual
uh to serve the students that have
elected to go that way so um
we've just been hard at work trying to
get that ready
so for for the students that go virtual
and what percentage do you think
of your students are going to start
virtual so
we have we're running somewhere but
around 27 percent of our students
uh have elected to go virtual and so
they will actually have a teacher that
would be
will that be live then basically a live
interaction or how does that work
so it will look a little differently uh
for each each side of the house the high
school
will have access to a live uh educator
but i think they'll also have more of a
blended model where they'll be able to
engage with in
in course work and then uh interact with
the teacher or a content expert
and then in our elementary school it
will be one of our local teachers that
will provide
hide uh that instruction and we'll
follow the same you know pacing guide
and calendar as
uh the students that are that are in
person uh
tell us a little bit about your district
yeah yeah we're about a thousand
students in southeast ohio
uh a really great community a nice
mixture of folks and
uh actually coming up on our 150th year
of educating students which is exciting
that's great so what was the you
mentioned there's a difference between
what the
elementary teachers excuse me the
elementary parents who had elementary
kids
and those who had high school kids what
were their what were their goals
different schools
yeah so i i think i would say that our
elementary parents uh felt a little more
trepidatious about our return to schools
our high school parents i think uh
because of maybe the extracurriculars
and
and and the other types of things that
happened in the high school
i think had less risk tolerance than
than some of our other families and so
for us it was all about you know what
how can we
best balance this and you know although
ultimately we were able to welcome
students five that five days a week
i think in my mind that's only because
of our low community spread
that that we've had in washington county
we've been a level one county for
several weeks
and we're just very briefly a level two
county but
uh you know i understand that uh
we also don't have high-speed internet
in southeast ohio in many areas
especially outlying areas so that was a
factor
in our decision but uh we just passed
support for graduate and we try to be
critical thinkers so
we know reasonable minds can differ uh
on these kind of conclusions and a
community might look very similar to us
and may make a different decision but
that's why we appreciate ohio's decision
to get to local level and allow us to
work with families and make a decision
that's right for us
well good luck good luck to you and and
your students and uh
and your and your parents uh what what
about sports last question are you
you y'all doing sports this fall what
are you doing
uh well i just walked out of our
athletic meetings so uh about nine
o'clock we received the final
information and orders and have said it
was a little late last night that's all
right we had a flurry of activity i'll
say today
uh we you know we are committed to doing
this we think it's a
it's an important part of uh our
students uh extracurricular
and really co-curricular life but boy
we're going to make sure we can do
everything we can to mitigate risk and
allow those uh student athletes to
participate
and we we are very grateful for that
good luck thank you sir thank you thanks
for joining us we
appreciate it we know you're busy thanks
for taking the time to do it yes sir
thank you governor
let me now welcome christy pennington
christie has more than
18 years of experience as a mental
health professional
working in schools she served as a
student advocate in columbus city
schools
through the communities and schools
program and for the past 13 years she
has served as a school-based therapist
supervisor and director of hopewell
health centers
working in with the logan hocking school
district
christie was recently promoted to serve
as the director of the hocking county
behavior health clinic
with hopewell health christie is also
the mom
to two middle school girls uh who
learned remotely in the spring
christy welcome thank you very very much
for for joining us
thank you very much for having me um and
thank you for
really keeping social emotional health a
consistent and central part of this
conversation as we as we move through
this pandemic
well tell us what what parents should
know uh
what any of us should know uh in this
area
because i know that look this has been a
difficult time starting back when kids
were out of school in march uh nothing
has been really normal
uh talk to us a little bit about the
mental health
ramifications of this and maybe some
things that uh
parents should know teachers should know
the public should know
absolutely so a lot of parents um are
concerned they have various concerns
right so some parents are concerned that
they
their kids need to get back to a routine
they need to get back to face-to-face
learning
because they've been a little bit
socially isolated
especially i'm also in southeastern ohio
so
we our communities are sometimes a
little spread out in the country and
there may not be
as good of internet access than other
things to get people connected so i know
that that's a concern
of people other concerns surround
anxiety
about going back to school or anxiety
about how school is going to work
so um i'll come at it from a couple
different angles so
if you're planning on sending your kiddo
back in person
some of the things that you may want to
do to
calm your kiddos anxiety would be to
talk about some of the new routines that
are going to be happening in schools
schools are absolutely going to be
different even if we're going back in
person
i know a lot of districts have done a
really wonderful job with virtual open
houses
um so if you have access to those please
do watch them
other things you want to talk to your
kids about are the masks right
no one's excited about the masks but
it's going to help
our communities and it's going to help
our kids stay in school longer
if people participate in the mask
wearing so
um it's helpful if adults put aside
their differences about whether they
like the masks or don't like the mask
and create the conversation as more
of an adventure for little kids this is
different but we're all going to wear
masks and it's going to be
fine and exciting other things that
may be different or you may have to talk
to your older kids about
they're not going to have lockers this
year so they're going to be carrying
everything
in their book bags they may get their
temperature checked
every day we certainly want parents
checking their temperatures at home
before sending them and they may get
their temperature checked again at
school just depending on different
different policies and procedures
another thing that our older kids
are going to have to deal with a little
bit is us asking them some more
questions about whether they have
symptoms i know that
my teenager doesn't really like when i'm
poking and prodding
in her life and you know how do you feel
today do you have a headache do you have
this i think these are going to have to
become more central
um to kind of our everyday routine um
and after telling little kids it's going
to be okay if you get corrected at
school if you accidentally
you know take your mask down someone
might ask you to put it back up and
that's okay we're all still practicing
this but
if we want to be able to go back to
school
face to face as many days as possible
we're gonna have to do these things that
are keeping us safe which is wearing our
mask
staying six feet away from our friends
and also maybe being asked to wash our
hands more than we were before
um what what about you yeah
go ahead i'm sorry good i was just gonna
ask you we may also need to create some
new routines at home
right so for students who are maybe
going to start virtually
like the students in akron we're going
to have some different things that are
going to help it be easier so
we want to first understand the format
so dr james did a really nice job
of talking about how they really took
what happened last year when we went
home in the spring and we learned from
it and he's creating a virtual learning
experience that has a little bit more
structure
one of the things that makes in-person
school
so um popular
and easy for our students to learn is
that there's a built-in structure to
that so
we want to understand the format is it
going to be a structure where i need to
maybe help my younger student get on a
zoom call
early in the morning and how do i need
to be present for that
or is it like the middle and high school
students where it's going to be more
self-guided and there's going to be
educators that are
available you're going to want to find
out
if how to access your it help right
because
most of the time our technology works
but the times when it doesn't work we're
going to need to know
how to do that other things that you can
do to make this
experience easier and easier transition
would be to create a separate learning
space in your house
this doesn't need to be an entire room
or you're going to do school out of a
separate room it could just be
a space at the end of your counter where
the student's always going to come and
have their
learning materials or their laptops so
that they're kind of in a separate space
ready for school you may also have to
talk about new rules i know that last
year
when we were doing remote learning from
home and my husband and i were both
working from home
we had to talk about things like when is
it a good time to interrupt your parent
who's also working and things like that
so
you're going to want to talk about rules
when's it okay to come get me
do you have someone that's available to
help your student all day long or
do we need to get some support help in
there for that
um and then at the end of the day we're
going to evaluate how it went
we're going to reach out for help if we
need help
um i know that there are so many groups
on social media right now
um many who have been advocates of
homeschooling or remote learning for a
long time
and they already have this figured out
so it's really helpful to reach out to
those people who have helpful hints i
know that in our district i've seen a
couple
facebook groups go up for parents who
have chosen the digital learning option
so that they can kind of be a support
group for each other and at the end of
the day
if it didn't work today we're going to
revamp and we're going to try again
tomorrow so
it's really important to be flexible and
forgiving of ourselves
and just try again tomorrow
well thank you very very much that's
been very helpful this is a new time for
all of us
and there's i'm sure there's
you know particularly tensions for kids
going back to school haven't been in
school for a while
uh longer than normal
but also if you're doing it remote
that's got to be attention too that's
got to be
something to get used to so thank you
thanks for
for sharing some ideas with us and your
experience with us
we appreciate it thank you thank you
throughout this pandemic older ohioans
have been hit
especially horror due in large part to
their high degree of susceptibility to
covet 19
and to the congregate nature of many
long-term care facilities
closures and restrictions of impacted
nursing homes assisted living
home and community-based services adult
care centers and senior
centers we've begun to allow limited
visitation at nursing homes
and assisted living facilities if those
facilities could coordinate
visits safely however adult day care
centers
and senior centers have remained closed
since march 23rd
our administration has worked with the
ohio association of senior centers
and those representing adult care
centers nationally
to develop a responsible restart plan
today i'm announcing that these
facilities may open beginning on
september 21st
uh in a reduced capacity if they're able
to meet certain
safety standards and again this goes
back to
what we've said a lot and people
probably sick
of john and i talking about but we can
do two things at once
we can be safe we can be protective but
we can try to get back
to normal and so it's important to do it
we're delaying the opening until
september 21st
we're providing time by doing this for
each center to properly prepare
based on the order's guideline each
center should consider a variety of
factors when determining its ability to
reopen including the case status
in the surrounding community how much
covet is there
the county's public health advisory
system color
the risk level the case status in its
facility
and the facility's staffing levels
access to testing
the ability of participants to wear face
coverings
access to personal protective equipment
and local hospitality
excuse me local hospital capacity
requirements for
center to reopen include the following
open with a limited capacity based on
safe social distancing
two limit entry to the facility to those
who are necessary for the safe operation
the program
three screen all participants and staff
and keep a daily log
four conduct baseline and repeat testing
of staff and participants
five require all staff and participants
to wear face coverings with limited
exceptions
six use co cohorting of participants
when possible and older schedules to
reduce contact
next implement cdc guidance for cleaning
disinfectant and sanitizing
adult day centers and senior centers
certainly play an important role in the
lives of so many
of our older ohioans this order provides
guidance for these facilities to begin
to safely
open details will be made available on
coronavirus.ohio.gov let me talk for a
moment about
assisted living testing we've been
working to protect some of ohio's most
vulnerable residents
often when covid positive test patient
is identified there are others in the
facility who are also infected but who
do not yet have symptoms
often these individuals unknowingly
contribute to the spread of the virus
so rapid action to identify isolate and
test others who might be infected is
critical
to prevent the spread consistent with
our efforts to test in nursing homes a
statewide testing initiative
for ohio's more than 765 assisted living
facilities is underway the ohio
department of health and the ohio
department of aging have secured a
testing provider who is able to offer
baseline saliva testing to all assisted
living staff
and residents and that is at no cost to
the facility
we're pleased with this testing option
which has started
as the test can be self-performed or
performed with assistance
under the observance of licensed medical
staff
the tests themselves are minimally
invasive and provide reliable results in
about 48 hours
upon the lab's receipt the value in this
initiative is tied to four things
accuracy and sensitivity of the test how
quickly you get test results
consistently repeat testing in high risk
settings and modifying behavior based on
the results
data our administration has worked
closely with the associations
representing assisted living providers
to implement this initiative and we're
grateful for their support
our focus has been and remains
protecting ohioans while navigating
through this pandemic to achieve this we
must have a hundred percent
participation
of all assistant living facilities in
ohio therefore
today i i'm issuing an order that
requires all assisted living facilities
to participate in coven 19 testing as
i've outlined for staff
and for residents the order and related
guidance will be available
at coronavirus.ohio.gov
let me now turn to the attorney general
not to the attorney general i've been
thinking about the attorney general
today but turn to the lieutenant
governor
john houston john thank you governor
uh it was great to hear from those
educators and so
i'll give a little update on something
that's education related as you know we
announced a 50 million dollar
uh grant called the k-12 broadband
connectivity grant
and this is to enable the uh funding for
hot spots
and and internet-enabled devices for
students
we've had a great response as you would
you would expect because we we talked to
people we knew this was a problem
i want to try to get some resources for
the 592 applications already
for this from from schools across the
state
the reason i'm bringing this up is
tomorrow's the deadline
you've got to get your your application
in by tomorrow
uh at the end of the day and i've been
told that we will make
the the schools will get notified the
week of august 31st so the team that's
listening
let's try to go faster let's let's get
these things
get let these schools know what
resources they're going to have
available and
and get this out to them as to as soon
as they can but get your applications in
by tomorrow
that's really important if you need
information
it's at ohio k12 dot help
slash broadband ohio dash connectivity
dash grant i know that's a lot we'll get
it out on all of our social media
channels so
you can you can find that and get to it
also um one of the other things that we
did
is we talked with all of the internet
providers all of these providers and
said let's get your best deal
let's post it let's you know get your
best offer on the table so that these
schools
uh can know uh where to go and what the
price will be and so far we've had 36
vendors
that have listed their their their
information their equipment up to this
point
and you can find that at pecure
we'll also send that information out on
social media so it's easy to track down
additionally we have a new new new
announcement today
as you know governor innovate ohio and
the bmv team have been working
from the very beginning at improving the
way that we serve our customers at the
bmv

uh and then let's go to voting i know
there's been a lot of conversations
about voting as of late
i want to reassure people that we've had
a tried and true
practice of you know all of the above
voting in-person voting early voting
voting by mail
it's worked well in the past it's going
to work well this year i talked with
secretary of state larose
i think we've been talking almost on a
daily basis here of late to make sure
that
everything is getting uh nailed down
remember
you must request an absentee ballot if
you want one
the good news is it's easy you can do
that right now
you can call the board of elections and
do it you can go
to the secretary of state website to do
that
voteohio.gov you can find
those absentee requests gives you a way
to make those requests
uh but you don't have to do it that way
if you wait until after labor day
secretary larose is going to mail you
one you know every registered voter will
get one mailed to them
fill that out send it back in and then
on october the 6th then
your ballot will be mailed to you and
you'll have nearly a month to fill it
out
and get it stamp on it and mail it back
in
and it is easy uh to do uh there are a
variety of ways to
to go through this process um but you
don't have to wait
don't procrastinate that's the number
one thing don't procrastinate don't wait
do it now if you want wait till you get
it from the secretary
and this will be an easy process for you
we've been doing this in ohio
reassured not much new here
and if you're if you have questions
though on any of this voting related
information go to voteohio.gov
and remember this is something that i
know will provide
a little bit of comfort to you if you
mail in your ballot
you can track it you can go and track it
and you'll see that it's been
received all of that gets tracked online
and you can see that information
as a matter of reassurance so just
wanted to provide those updates governor
and it's great to see all of the
innovative things that schools are doing
to help the kids get back and get this
right i know
that the educators are are excited too
to make sure that they're they're
getting the job done so thanks governor
lieutenant governor thank you very much
speaking about
voting i've asked director dan schroeder
of the department of administrative
services
to work with secretary of state frank
larose to ensure that the 88 boards of
election have the ppe resources
they need to execute early in-person
voting and voting on election day
we know there are many ohioans who would
like to vote in person
that's some who do some who don't but
they get their choice
over the next few weeks director dan
schroeder will be coordinating the
delivery
of let me look at the number
eight hundred thousand face masks and
other items of personal protection it's
our hope to have the ppe to our board of
elections by early
september to each board of election
around this state i want to thank our
partners at the ohio
manufacturing alliance to fight coven
magnet
in cleveland the developmental service
agency in jobs ohio for their continuing
support of our efforts to make ppe to
make it here in ohio
i like these face shields we're very
proud
of that of that fact
finally today i'm asking the bureau of
workers compensation board of directors
to send out 1.5 billion in dividend
payments
to ohio employers this fall if this is
approved by the board this will be our
second dividend of over a billion
dollars since april our third
since 2019. employers told us after the
april
dividend that these dollars certainly
can be lifesavers
for business and so i've made the
decision to ask
the board uh to do this and to do it now
and not wait because we know that
there's some businesses out there that
very much can use this money
now uh april's dividend 1.35 billion
went to private employers
184 million went to local government
taxing districts including various
counties
cities and schools we anticipate that
checks should start going out this is
approved in late october
additionally i'm asking the bureau of
workers compensation board of directors
to vote to distribute a
second round second round of face
coverings to ohio employers and their
workforce
as part of bwc's programming protect
ohio's workforce
we've got you covered that's what's
called bwc has shipped
20 million masks to 197
000 employers and their workforce since
may so this would be a second round
that would consist of approximately 23
million
mass to employers they're meant to
replace any mass that have exhausted
their effective use
we've asked bwc to work to purchase as
many masks as possible
to do that in ohio if possible
uh so we're now ready for for questions
governor your first question today is
from max philby at the columbus dispatch
afternoon governor um i'm curious about
the adult day centers as they
move to reopen in september what kind of
testing protocol will surround that
and will you will your administration
also be reporting cases and whatnot like
you have
with long-term care facilities with the
adult day centers
yes we will outline
uh that in the future we wanted to give
a date
and give people time to start moving
forward with that
the only caution i would have is that
all of this is subject to
what we're seeing as we move forward
so you know as we we continue to
evaluate
and frankly we had discussion this
morning um
in our senior staff meeting at eight
o'clock we talked about
um you know how work we can evaluate
what is going on
with the opening up of our nursing homes
uh and the visitation
and that's an ongoing process so uh
the date that we sat um
and also what's going on in regard to
our assisted living as well
so we'll have more information about
that as we move forward but
again i have a caution uh it's our goal
to open on that date
to allow everybody to open but we'll
continue to monitor the facts
uh we're going to continue to frankly uh
you know see how far along we are
in uh very aggressive uh testing
at that point so it's a month away or so
but we want to give everybody some
warning that's coming they can start
going our goal is to do it
but we've that we've not put the final
uh
green flag up yet and we will not until
we get closer to that date we know
exactly where our testing is and we know
exactly
what else we're seeing in the
communities so more to come
next question is from adrian robbins at
wcmh in columbus
governor thank you for doing this today
um as we see more spread in the rural
areas of our state and at the same time
it seems that those areas are more
likely to do in-person learning
have you thought about beginning to tie
closures of schools or
closures of any other businesses to the
county map and incentivize those
counties to get their numbers down
well i i've tried to make it very clear
uh based on what we're seeing
that there ought to be a real incentive
for those communities to get their
numbers down
because if they can't if they don't get
the numbers down
i think it's unlikely that they're going
to be frankly successful
in school being open and playing sports
um and you know those counties are going
to
will get the early warning signs i i
think
if that is happening so you know it's
very important as we get close to the
beginning of school
for those counties to take control uh of
their future
and taking control of their future means
looking at what's happened in the last
two months in ohio
when our urban areas went to about 90
percent
compliance with mass and we saw we've
continued to see a drop for a number of
weeks
uh in in those in those counties so
i've i've made it as crystal clear as i
can
that based upon everything that we're
seeing um
you know if you wear masks the rate goes
down
if people are conscious about keeping
separation keeping the distance the rate
goes down
and we know that that school
is going to reflect
the rate in the school is going to
reflect what is out in the community
so i i think there's you get your right
to your question there is a real
incentive out there
i mean a real incentive look every
people want their kids back in school
they want their kids to
play sports they want they want to have
uh as
is open a life as they can in the in the
era of covet and the way to get that
freedom
uh the way to get that freedom is
frankly this is a pathway to freedom
i mean it really really is uh and
putting aside any ideological
uh discussion the science clearly shows
and
our experience in ohio shows our
experience in ohio shows this works
and so that's i think there's a lot of
incentive without me
you know putting my hand in it i think
there's a lot of incentive
for our rural communities to to do that
next question is from laura hancock at
cleveland.com
hi governor um just wanted to ask you
about goodyear
after president trump urged his twitter
followers to boycott
goodyear i mean he said in an interview
that you didn't think it would be
something that he'd say again
but then later the same day he doubled
down calling on people to boycott
good gear um do you think that was
appropriate
for him to call on a boycott of a ohio
based manufacturer
and have you talked to the president or
anyone at the white house to express
your concerns about
it well i don't usually i don't discuss
usually
my contacts with with people at the
white house
but look
we should not boycott this good company
uh with good ohio workers uh who
are doing a good job and making a good
product
um so you know we should not have any
kind of boycott
um you know we we have uh a couple
good good tire companies in ohio and uh
you know we should
we should patronize them um
you know i don't think we know all the
facts um i would just say in general i'm
not commenting about this case because i
really don't
much as i've tried to read about it i
don't fully understand
what happened but uh
i'm a believer in the first amendment
and i think as much
while any company has a right to run its
business the way it wants to run it
um i think it's it's always better uh if
if people have the ability to
uh express themselves uh as long as that
does not
get in the way of the work uh or the
mission of the organization so i
i come down on the side of the first
amendment and people's ability to
to express and i think you'll find that
i'm pretty consistent
in that regard there are limits and i
know legally that a company can
you know can control what goes on in
their workplace but i would uh
i would just think companies should be
as open uh to first amendment things as
they can this is that's what kind of
country this is
next question is from tanisha johnson at
spectrum news
hi governor um two quick questions one
is
once testing starts uh in the assisted
living facilities
how confident are you when it comes to
having all of the resources necessary
including the personnel
to carry it out so that there's not a
slowing in the process
and then the other question as you
mentioned on tuesday
lieutenant governor did about site
inspectors at sporting events and
while we've seen um some challenges
across the country um with people
quote-unquote being the mask police um
what is your message
to those who may have to carry out uh
those duties
at sporting events well i'm going to let
you i'm going to let john ants
answer the second one but basically we
are
working with the ohio high school
athletic association
on that um and so we really do have done
two things
one is the school or whoever the host is
has to have one person who
everybody can contact about compliance
uh and then the ohio high school
athletic association is going to do some
spot checks
um and we're going to help them uh
financially with a little money uh to be
able to do that
uh because everyone wants these young
people to be able to play
uh and we want it done in in you know in
a proper way and the focus needs to be
on the field
in the arena on the kids who are doing
what they
love to do as far as the assisted living
and saliva
we've our team has worked very hard on
this
we have a contract with with a company
it is saliva
it is self-administered or or it has to
be administered with somebody who has
been trained
uh somebody in the medical field who has
been trained
but we think it's going to work well
is started uh we're only getting getting
results back
uh so far we've been running uh about
four percent
positivity uh it's ranged anywhere from
zero
uh to twelve percent uh and what this
means is when you go into an assisted
living
and you test and you get those numbers
back then
the local health department can take
over tracing can occur
and lives can be saved so we're very
very excited about it and we we feel
confident
that it will work uh we're into if we're
into a few days now already we're
starting to see some of the results
john uh thanks governor yeah to the
question
um this is how the process works at
every home team
has the responsibility of having someone
in charge of controlling the venue
to make sure that things are being
implemented
properly remember everybody in the arena
stadium
is supposed to be a family member or
loved one of a contestant so
that they should want to create an
environment in there that's conducive to
to operating the game uh
in a in a thoughtful way uh additionally
um
when an inspector goes out this is why
we're doing it with the ohio high school
athletic association
because certainly a local health
department has this authority
but the extra incentive here if you if
you care about your student athlete out
there that if you don't follow the rules
the ohio high school athletic
association
has the ability and reserves the right
to cause a forfeiture of the game
disqualify a team from from
participating so
all of those kinds of things are
relevant to making sure
that this all goes smoothly because then
look
in the end everybody in there should
have the same goal it's about the kids
it's about giving them a chance to play
and if you don't do this safely
you're not looking out for them uh and
so we
we will we would appeal to people to the
best entrance of the
of the students that they're supposed to
care about to do this right so that
they can continue to play through the
season uninterrupted
thanks lieutenant governor who's next
next question is from alex ebert at
bloomberg
good afternoon governor and thanks for
having us on
west virginia and kentucky are both
going forward
with providing the hundred dollars to
have the full 400 dollar
extra unemployment benefit for their
workers
under trump's executive order they have
tighter budgets
they have worse unemployment systems
than ohio why can't ohio
go forward with the same thing for its
workers well i will call those governors
and i'll find out
kind of how they're doing it you know we
did an analysis and the analysis was
that we
would not be able to do that so i'll get
back
to everyone but you know our analysis
shows that
we simply do not have the money to do it
so i'm not sure how
how they're frankly going to pull that
off but
i'm always open to learning
next question is from jim oddy at whio
in dayton
governor i want to go back to your
sports order a major soccer tournament
is scheduled for
labor day weekend in beaver creek and
you know this is a big annual community
event as well
uh your new restrictions so limit this
to one team
playing another team per day so you can
play multiple
games between the two teams but that's
it per day and it seems to prevent
the real true tournament schedule that
brings people together for this
was it your intention to prevent a real
true tournament where you play multiple
games against multiple teams or is this
just a a byproduct
of of your order what what's going on
here and what do you intend
yeah jim i'll be quite candid uh we did
not want to see
uh multiple games with multiple teams
per day uh it just didn't does not make
sense
um you know there's a model um that we
have seen used
um in certain parts of the state where
people come in uh and you know the
traveling team might come in
they may come even from out of state um
i'm not talking about beaver creek now
but
come out of state they come in on friday
they play a game they play two three
games on saturday two three games on
sunday
they're playing different teams all the
way through and so you've had a
tremendous amount of mixing
that's a very different thing than a
football team
that is playing on a friday night or
soccer that is that is playing
one team and so our goal is to let
competitions work work forward let kids
play
but the idea of we're trying to limit
the amount of literally exposure
uh for for those those kids um
you know for example i'll take a sport
that i know a little bit more about uh
that that is
don't pretend to be an expert but that's
cross country um
you know we would encourage a lot of
dual meets frankly uh we hope that
schools will be able to
you know we want the kids to run uh they
can run just as much
uh with a dual meet uh then as they can
bringing in
20 teams and and so we just are you know
and i think the ohio
high school athletic association is in
agreement with that i think the coaches
of the cross country teams are in
agreement with that so that's just
i'm only using that as an example that
throughout this we want to try to limit
exposure of these kids we want them to
play but we don't
want to have this this great mixing
uh of kids with many many other kids
from different from many many different
schools
so yeah i mean we purposely wrote that
language we thought
long and hard about it we consulted the
doctors we consulted the health
officials and that's what we came up
with
next question is from ellen wagner at
mahoningmatters.com
hi governor um we're regularly hearing
from readers
who like to remind us that you're not
making laws you're mandating
um and these policies mean little to
them how can you change their minds so
that they can take these
uh mandates more seriously
um you want to repeat the first part of
it you're hearing you're hearing from
readers who are saying what i missed the
what i'm sorry
i apologize we're hearing from readers
who are
saying that um you're not making laws
you're mandating them um and
how these policies mean little to them
so how can you change their minds so
that they take
uh these mandates seriously well look
they
you know look we don't ask people to
listen to me we ask them
to listen to the doctors to medical
experts to look at what's happening in
other states look at what's happening in
ohio the mask order is a prime example
i understand the controversy with mass
but you know if you talk to the the best
experts that you can find
whether you're watching tv or whether
you're you're pulling it up online
um you know the jury's returned there's
no there's no dispute that masks
are very very very important and so
it's also a question of experience in
ohio
i mean we have seen what's happened in
ohio when an
area decides okay people individually
making individual decisions
and collectively they come up that
ninety percent of them are wearing masks
the rate goes down it does and so
you know if we want to have kids in
school if we want to have sports
if we want to have as normal life as we
can
you know this is what what we have to do
so no i'm not asking them
to necessarily listen to me but listen
to the experts
who who do this for a living and have
worked their way through this and have
studied this
uh and the evidence i i just think is is
overwhelming
um you know if you look at
what i think it is a prudent uh
conservative approach to do
some sacrifice wearing a mask uh for
example
so that you're gonna have more freedom i
mean to me that is the ultimate
conservative approach
cautious conservative approach it is an
approach
that expands liberty it's an approach
that expands freedom and i think that is
truly the way that uh you know it it
should be looked at
next question is from kevin landers at
wbns in columbus
hi kevin
we'll uh have kevin go next uh the next
question is from andy chow at ohio
public radio and television
hi governor i wanted to make sure i
understood something you said earlier
do you support president donald trump's
call
to boycott goodyear and are state
employees allowed to wear political
attire
can you hear me now governor well well
kevin let me let me do andy's
let me do andy's question first if i if
if i if i could
um and you want to you want to repeat
them
the last one was your political attire
and do you support president donald
trump's call to boycott goodyear
no no no no no absolutely not we should
not
boycott this good ohio company they have
good ohio workers
and they produce a very good product
second question had to do with state
employees
state employees are very different than
someone who is working in the private
sector
you know they they come upon with more
restrictions that are built into the law
i don't think that we would
want let's say a state inspector
who is out who might have a political
button on
on state time and taxpayers paying
for that person so that's not allowed so
i think
you know andy it's it's a very different
thing
than what happens uh in in a private
enterprise
where we don't have that situation
where taxpayers are paying uh for that
person's
time and taxpayers have to expect
during that period of time only that
that person
just goes about their business and and
does not you know broadcast uh some
which party they're for or which
candidate they're for but i think
there's a fund
there's a fundamental difference between
the two
next question is from kevin landers at
wbns in columbus
hello governor hey kevin sorry about
that uh governor during this pandemic
your administration has demonstrated
broad powers to keep ohio and safe
you've
mandated masks you've issued state
homeowners you've limited mass
gatherings and of course on march 12th
you ordered all public schools and
private k-12 school buildings to be
closed
of course you stopped bars from selling
alcohol at 10 o'clock
this week you've given schools the green
light to play sports this fall
but not the green light to go back to
allow children to head
to the classroom the optics right or
wrong
appear to send a message that sports are
safer than face-to-face learning how do
you respond to that
i i miss the part you said i've not
given the green light to go back to
school
is that what you said
i'm sorry this week you've given schools
the green light to play
fall sports and not
to mandate that children go back to the
classroom to have face-to-face learning
the optics right or wrong appear to send
a message that
contacts courts are safer than
face-to-face learning how do you respond
no i i don't see it that way at all
kevin look first of all
uh the parents are the most important
people
so the parents first of all make a
decision um
does that student go in person does that
student go remotely those families are
making that number one
all across the state of ohio number two
each school district and we are a state
of local school districts
over 630 some each school district
is making the choice how do they what
array of options do they give
and they're giving school districts are
by and large giving very wide options
they may have one preferred option if
they go back
so they could they can do that as well
so it's very
you know very very open uh all we did
this week uh all we did on tuesday
uh we didn't infringe on the parents
rights parents had the right to say yes
or no we didn't infringe on the school's
rights they have a right to say yes or
no
we gave the school a second option if
they want to
not have their football team playing or
their soccer team playing this fall
they can try to do it in the spring they
can do that we're not interfering with
that
we worked with ohio high school athletic
association to make sure that that
choice was there because
we didn't want it to be you either play
this fall or you don't play at all
we wanted to give them more options and
and so and so that is the option that we
we gave them but um uh you know what we
did
with the order on tuesday is we
we just presented the most carefully
designed
plan that we could come up with
consulting with coaches consulting with
health experts
that if the parent wants the child to
play and if the school wants the child
to play both have to occur
the child can play um and that's that's
what we did
john and i spent the next five hours on
the phone talking to coaches and
athletic directors
so um i don't come to the same
conclusion that you
you do uh these are individual choices
and look
i i've been pretty blunt uh if you're in
a school district and you're red i put
the
map up there if you're in a red county
and you think you're going back in
person you you have a right to do that
but you know this is a high risk
proposition
and you you know you've got to get
you've got to get your covet down
in your county or probably will not be
successful
next question is from marty schladen at
the ohio capitol journal
good afternoon governor how are you
today
good um advocates warn that in the
absence of
congressional action low-income ohioans
are on the
brink of economic calamity in the next
couple of weeks
the group advocates for ohio future is
calling on you to appropriate 243
million dollars
of the more than one billion dollars in
ohio's unapproved
unappropriated cares act funds
they want it for emergency rental
assistance utility assistance
money for food and basic needs and funds
for child care
the response to that request
yeah and we're looking we're certainly
looking at that but
you know i remain
convinced based on the best medical
advice
that we have a ways to go in this
pandemic
i'm also advised by the best
people we can talk to that if we really
want to try to keep these numbers down
and keep it to a
slow burn instead of a flare up
which will create even more havoc
in the economy uh we're going to have to
have testing it's going to have to be
robust
uh we're going to be very aggressive
with it so you know we have
uh our our foot to the accelerator as
far as we can push it in regard to
testing
i anticipate that more testing just like
the saliva testing that i was just
talking about
so we have i'm not unmindful of the
merit of the request that you referenced
but i think our fundamental goal
has to be to keep the virus down
because nothing else can happen if we
don't keep the virus down
and so very aggressive testing we have
to make sure we have enough
money set aside to get us through what
may be tough winter
we don't know some of the experts who
who i've consulted nationwide have said
look november december january could be
very very very rough
with the flu coming back at the same
time people all indoors
and and the virus spreading so
that is a that is a i think an
imperative for us
to make sure we have the money for the
testing
next question is from jim province at
the toledo blade
hello governor um we were led to believe
that you were going to have an
announcement today involving
performing arts uh in schools and can
you give us an idea where you stand on
that
and also are you looking at this point
just at schools are you also looking at
professional and
amateur theaters and concert venues
well our goals is by tomorrow and we'll
just put it out we're not going to wait
until tuesday
our goal is by tomorrow to have an
order out guidance in regard to
performing arts
so across the board
next question is from scott alice at the
zenia daily gazette
that's god can you hear me i'm sorry
you're on now scott go ahead great
thanks for uh
taking my question i want to go back to
the creek classic for a second hopefully
this wasn't already asked but
historically
in these types of tournaments and you
have flying to the hoop coming up in
january in the dayton area
there's a lot of teams that come in from
out of state is there still a 14-day
quarantine
quarantine requirement if they come in
from out of state are they going to be
allowed to
you know come in because if they're
coming in for a weekend tournament it's
kind of hard to quarantine for 14 days
yeah i mean that's an advisory um i
don't think that we
i don't think that is actually an order
uh i'll check that
but again scott our here's our concern
and here's the health experts concern
we want kids to play
we want them to compete we want them to
have a great experience
but these tournaments
that bring in schools from all over
uh and then mix them in with our local
kids
and where they're playing maybe more
than one game a day
against a different opponent is just
doubling tripling
the amount of exposure that our young
people in ohio have
and so i know that this is something
that people enjoy
i know the young people enjoy doing it
um you know
what could be better if you're you know
12 15 years old and
you know play five games that weekend or
six or seven i get it
but it's just not safe and so this is
our compromise this is kind of
how we can get let people play uh but
also try to shelter them from that
wide exposure um to to kids
who they've not had a contact with
before not gonna have contact with
um you know it's one thing to play one
team it's something very different to
pay two
different to play three four five you're
just you're multiplying the
the danger uh not only to the kids but
you're multiplying the danger to to the
community
um and that's true for all the kids the
kids who come in as well as the kids who
are from
from ohio
governor i'd like to add to that um look
we're going to learn
and we you know we talked with the ohio
high school athletic association because
they talked about having a big
cross-country meet
and i said look don't don't do a big
event and create a problem before we
even get a chance to get started
uh you got to learn to walk before your
run let's let's have some
one-on-one team competitions to see if
this works well
so that we can learn and build
confidence before we consider any
larger kind of events i think that
there's general consensus among the
people who've been looking at this that
that's
that's the the most uh prudent way to
proceed and
and then governor supported what you
just said uh with schools academically
or sports
this is a local choice they're very
consistent they're they're exactly
consistent with one another
on how we're taking this approach
next question is from jeff redick at
wsyx
in columbus hello governor
you mentioned the performing arts
guidance will be coming out
tomorrow other activities in schools
specifically choir
i guess anything that involves singing
or projecting the voice
but also clubs science club robotics
club will you order extend to that is
that a different order are we still
waiting
i i would not think science club i mean
look we
teachers can figure that out i mean it's
against social distancing it's it's
really no different
it's no different activity than a lot of
other things kids are doing so we're not
going to get down into art or
science or you know there's really no
reason to do that
there's basic guidance there uh teachers
will certainly
do a good job in regard in regard to
that
so don't look look for that
choir the choir is a different
situation and uh we're gonna try to get
some good guidance just to help
our schools um you know very sadly
uh that i'm i never wasn't a choir i
can't sing
but love music and uh you know this has
been one of the things that
all of us have missed which is live
performance of
of music and it doesn't mean it can't
happen now but you know there's
clearly got to be distance i mean one of
the things that we've learned
uh is the spread of choirs we've seen it
in churches
uh we've seen it's a lot of people come
down with it and and
the more the scientists learn when
you're projecting
uh and you're singing uh that goes out
of
uh you know a long distance so again
it's particularly particularly difficult
um you know i've had some
uh superintendents tell me look they
already know what they're gonna do
you know as far as music they're going
to you know
teach more music theory uh and some
history and do some other things during
the
pandemic i mean look the good news is
this pandemic will get over with
uh we don't know when but it's going to
get over with and uh
you know we're going to be able to get
back to normal and do all the other
things that we like
so we'll have some guidance in regard to
choir but again it's going to that's
going to depend on
you know how that school once wants to
handle it and how they want to figure it
out
governor your next question is the last
question for today and it belongs to
noah blundo at hannah news service
good afternoon governor uh can you hear
me i can indeed thank you
thank you um i'm wondering in your
sports order
there's language about um needing a
cardiac
risk assessment in order to be able to
return to play if you
have a case is your understanding that
is that something that
somebody can get from their family
physician or are we going to have
athletes needing to see cardiologists
or get special equipment um
because the legislation that could mean
it's essentially season ending if you
just yeah i mean look this is this was
based on what
has really been learned in the last
month or so uh
and we saw it uh you heard you heard
from the doctor at ohio state
um you know of their athletes who tested
positive
the 13 of them had this
problem uh thank heavens it was not
serious with any of them
but based upon that and based upon what
other people are reporting
we know that this does go along
with uh the covet uh can go
can go in ohio state's case it was 13 of
the of the young athletes uh and so no
we're not
prescribing what we're saying is go to
your local doctor
um you know have them follow the best
protocol and you know we put some things
down
but the truth is that a month from now
the best protocol may be very different
or
at least different or more nuanced at
least and so
we've provided that and so people can
continue to
update that and your local doctor will
be able to update that and see exactly
what the
you know the most current information
is but again this goes back we're trying
to protect our young people
um you know the sudden death uh is
something that we worry about with
athletes
when we don't have the code but this
apparently contributes uh to more people
you know having that syndrome with the
heart
which could lead could lead to that
the advice is the same uh candidly uh
you know to a 30 year old who likes to
run
you know you probably better get cleared
to go run extensively
before you go back to do that if you if
you've had the virus
so it'd be no different someone who's
going to be active needs to get that
cleared
that's what the doctors are telling us
well that is it thank you all very much
hope everyone has a nice weekend
and look forward to seeing you at two
o'clock on tuesday
thank you
you
