america's drug addict
so please join me in listening welcoming
achievement
uh
thank you
setting the example
well thank you thank you judge powell i
want to thank you for your service
i also want to thank you for i think it
was two
uh judicial conferences of go of
introducing me to
uh one of the best irish whiskeys i've
ever had redressed so
you re you really have opened broadened
my horizons on occasion so thank you
very much
uh good morning everybody i'm honored to
speak with you today this is my tenth
state of the judiciary
address and all of them have been
delivered of course at the ohio judicial
conference annual meeting
i want to begin by congratulating the
new officers of the ohio judicial
conference that i swore in a few minutes
ago
it's always a pleasure it has been a
pleasure for me to work with you as a
group
and i look forward to our continuing uh
involvement uh uh through the judicial
conference
your uh vision uh your contribution
um your discussion uh your perspective
are always welcome and a great a great
resource i think for the supreme court
praise is warranted for the judicial
conference members and staff as well as
judicial
college of the supreme court for putting
together a very fine
program if this morning's program was
any indication i really enjoyed
the professor and as always very
insightful
and this afternoon should be no
exception recognition goes to the ohio
state bar association for serving as the
remote host
of the programs this year i also want to
recognize my colleagues who
are online like the rest of you
justices kennedy french fisher
justice dewine mike donnelly and justice
melody stewart
normally they would be standing in front
of you but
maybe they can stand in place like the
officers
and the chairs this forum is all about
sharing ideas
and working to advance the judiciary of
our state
the theme of this year's conference
breaking barriers a reference to the
100th anniversary
of the ratification of the 19th
amendment is quite fitting
but of course we all know there
continues to be barriers in our society
one of the most obvious presented itself
when ohio was hit with the pandemic
over six months ago the need to follow
the department of health guidelines
presented a barrier
to business as usual within our court
system
closing courts was not an option if ever
there was an essential activity in ohio
courts and the work we do rises to uh
rises high
on that list definitely below first
responders and medical professionals and
all of the many
many service workers who don't have the
option
or the luxury of working from home like
all of us do technology has made us
the judiciary a pretty fortunate group
of people
during this pandemic in the face of
coven 19
what were judges to do what did we do
and what do we continue to do
to answer that question i will outline
for you today the commitment of the ohio
judiciary
to not only deal with this pandemic but
to go even
further to improve the administration of
justice in our state
we have a health crisis to deal with and
we do not know when it will end
but we also have a long overdue mission
separate from that crisis
that mission is to seek out new and
higher levels
of the fair administration of justice
and access to justice
for all who come before our courts we
must accomplish this mission by creating
new tools and new ways of sharing
information we will commit ourselves to
examining the quality of our work
and we will work to make we will we will
make our work more visible to the public
and improve their confidence in what we
do
before i explain further i want to look
back at the past year and in particular
the past six months the public health
mandates
in our state have been a great but
necessary burden
i'm confident that the court of public
opinion will render a verdict in favor
of our courts when this health crisis
draws to a close
that's because when the pandemic hit our
first order of business was to act
quickly
to act positively and to act wisely the
response of judges in ohio
was remarkable you identified essential
matters
upon which to focus and meet the needs
of those who came before your courts
you released inmates from jail to lessen
the chance of the virus spreading
you set up hearings with remote
participation and adhered to masks
and sanitizing and social distancing
requirements
and you continue to do so you held
proceedings in makeshift courtrooms
many courts constructed plexiglas
shields and configured new ways for
participants to enter
and exit hearing rooms you communicated
your efforts locally
this deadly virus forced all of us to
adapt
and we did ohio course remained open
circumstances forced us to issue tolling
orders and jury trials were delayed
but those interruptions were an effort
to keep people
safe while we followed through on our
obligation to deliver
justice fairly ohio judges
went beyond the call to service and the
public took
notice of our labors the news media
spotlight has been honest
constantly since march and the coverage
has been overall
quite favorable the media and the public
came to understand that the courts were
innovating
on their behalf it's safe to say that
many judges and staff have even
surprised themselves
on how well they've adjusted to this new
reality
when i made six million dollars from our
budget available in march for judges to
purchase remote equipment
for their courtrooms the courts in 87
out of 88 counties responded
immediately applications flew into the
supreme court
where our fiscal staff worked overtime
to validate and approve these technology
grants
our work these past six months has shown
that judges in ohio
are focused on administering justice you
are doing so even when faced with
obstacles that could not have been
predicted
well actually that's not true we do have
one nostradamus on our staff and that's
milt newsom
the former washington county judge who
is director of the judicial services
at the ohio supreme court milk came to
me last year with an idea about
publishing a totally revised
pandem public health guide for courts
milk wanted me
and all of you to be ready for a health
emergency in fact he even used the word
pandemic
i said okay um on my mind at the time
was the training and exposure
that i had when i was director of the
department of public safety for four
years before i joined the court
i had participated in numerous tabletop
exercises
and trainings dealing with the spread of
a fast-moving highly contagious virus
for which there was no vaccine the
visuals presented
left a lasting impression upon me the
short time it took to spread around the
world
and the predictions of infections and
mortalities were sobering
so fast forward to 2020 and the covet 19
pandemic
and now it is no tabletop exercise
it is a reality court staff worked on
the public health guide for courts for
several months
and we sent it to you in january the
pandemic and shoot ensued a few weeks
later
thank you milt for your leadership on
the guides creation
that deliverable had a positive effect
although we did not know a year ago when
we started on the project
it helped us get ready for the pandemic
by providing specific details on the
ways courts could deal with the health
disaster
and the emergencies in general there are
so many judges in our state who stepped
up to the challenge of covet 19
and kept their courts in session and
kept justice flowing
there's simply not enough time here
today to mention
all of them i will point out a few
though while letting you know that i
appreciate
every effort from every judge during
this covet
and during this cobit pandemic licking
county municipal court judge david
stanbury reports that jury trials have
resumed there
both municipal courts have installed
physical barriers between
every juror seat between the rows of
seats and between seats and each council
table
their clear hanging barriers in front of
the his bench and between his seat and
the witness stand in between the witness
stand in the jury box
many courts have taken similar measures
and i must say i've been impressed with
the speed
at which these changes have occurred and
the level of workmanship many courts are
finding that remote video
and audio equipment paid for by the tech
grant is not only
essential during this pandemic but it
will be used
long after the pandemic is behind us as
it should be
we've identified new efficiencies
and ease of operation within the courts
because of the use of technology
franklin county municipal court is using
its equipment to expand
video remote language services they will
now include american sign language
interpreters to accommodate requests
made under the americans with
disabilities act
that is a great idea and an enduring one
our supreme court roster of interpreters
covers 29
languages today and it will grow
remote technology is a great way to
provide this service
when an in-person session is not
possible
lakewood municipal court judge pat
carroll and cuyahoga county domestic
relations judge
diane pelos stepped up when the pandemic
hit
they volunteered to teach courses at the
judicial college webinars about
creative solutions to keep the courts
open
during this crisis as the pandemic
continues
several courts are now live streaming
barbarian municipal
court ottawa county common pleas akron
municipal court common police court of
general division of cuyahoga county
the 10th district court of appeal to
name a few the barberton court in fact
is making use of local public access
tv channels as well this is a low-cost
effective way to keep the public
informed to keep
our courts open another tool for
transparency
that has come about because of the
pandemic but will be with us forever
going forward is a new
ohio virtual courtroom directory
this project allows courts who are live
streaming their proceedings to have that
info and schedule on this directory that
is housed at the supreme court
the public will for example be able to
look at the directory
they'll be able to see when the 10th
district court of appeals is holding
oral arguments
and tune into that argument in real time
every court that is live streaming will
submit their that information to the
supreme court will put it on the
directory
and that can be available uh we of
course have done this at the supreme
court since 2002
but now local courts can do this live
streaming
this type of project is a success in
michigan and i believe that it will be
a success here in ohio think of how it
will enhance your community's knowledge
of the court
in action the people who put you on the
bench
will be able to see you in action that
is an
important feature for the judges
to be able to access please explore how
your court can live stream
and join this directory and if you go to
the website of the garfield municipal
garfield heights municipal court you're
greeted by the image
and the soft voice of an avatar she is a
virtual assistant who asks you to click
on your questions
she then looks you in the eye and
produces an answer
the technology solutions in ohio courts
especially those in the past
six months are the very definition of
innovation
a court's ability to provide proper
access to justice while employing these
technologies
is something new accordingly guidance is
necessary
we have to establish guidance for the
courts the supreme court
just authorized to be out for public
comment
recommended changes to ohio rules of
criminal procedure 11 and 41 that make
clear
if adopted that defendants in a fiance
may appear electronically for plea
hearings and search warrant applications
whenever rules need to be updated to
make clear the new role of technology
and its use in the courts our court will
act
another leap forward is that ohio will
join a pilot project by the national
center for state courts
the project will explore public
perceptions of courts
and how they use remote technologies by
tapping into the collective experiences
of courts across america we will be able
to determine
when we in ohio are venturing down the
right path
and just as importantly when we're not
four of our courts will be part of the
ncsc project
the cuyahoga county domestic relations
court coshocton county juvenile
and probate court fairfield county
juvenile and probate
and montgomery county juvenile court i
thank these courts for taking part
and all of us await the results
another project that the pandemic has
spawned is the creation of the i
court task force i'm charging the task
force with examining how courts have
used technology during the pandemic
what have the experiences been survey
judges and attorneys about their
experience with remote appearances
and trials identified best practices
and technology what are the barriers and
the challenges to the use of technology
and more what do we do going forward
i've asked justice pat dewine to be the
supreme court liaison to this task force
and invitations are out to all of the
stakeholders to be part of this project
stay tuned because i think the report
that would be generated
by this task force will be a guide for
us
in the future in the use of technology
now
switching gears a bit and since it's an
election season i want to tell you that
i've noticed a record
high turnout among judges on judicial
votes count
website i'm talking about judges
submitting their biographies and
answering the questions
for those of you running for office who
haven't done so
you really should judicial
votescount.org is experiencing a record
number of inquiries by the public
and the media and that interest will
only go higher for the next two months
before the election
innovation in ohio courts hasn't been
limited to measures taken
to deal with the pandemic advances in
solving problems for ohioans in the name
of justice continues to grow
judge laura smith and the judges in
fairfield county have brought together
their community justice partners
they have begun training on how to
intervene
with spousal matters and effectively
supervise them
more and more courts and the judges are
using phone apps to get applicants to
court
on time it is a phenomenal tool across
all jurisdictions of courts to remind
people
of their court appointments and to
appear in court and the increase in peer
appearances
uh has skyrocketed the latest is ash to
beauty county juvenile court judge
albert kemp please to use this
technology
the cuyahoga county court of common
police has partnered with
a child advocacy center to train every
judge and magistrate
in the county about how trauma affects
those who come before the court
they're learning how judicial officers
can improve access
and outcomes for them and for their
community
thank you judges for these efforts and
thanks to all of you
whom the constraints of time i do not
have
the ability to acknowledge
we have forged innovation ourselves in
the supreme court this past
year we've established new rules
governing bail bond and pre-trial
release in criminal cases
today ohio courts must use the least
restrictive bond conditions
and the lowest amount of monetary bail
to secure a defendant's court appearance
going forward bond schedules are only to
be used for securing release
when court is not in session we also
recently appointed a task force on
conviction
integrity integrity and convictions are
two words that must always be spoken
in tandem the task force is charged with
analyzing
and recommending meaningful advancements
in procedures regarding
integrity of convictions and the
post-conviction review process
all interested parties have been invited
to participate and contribute to the
success of the report
i'm pleased to say that justice mike
donnelly is the supreme court liaison
and judge gene zamuta is the chair of
the task force
society's problems are laid at our
doorstep and rightfully so
it's hard and sometimes the work we do
can seem demoralizing
sometimes the cases that come before us
make us question if there's even a
solution
for one case let alone the thousands
that are pending in our dockets
and what's the use what's the purpose we
may ask ourselves
am i helping my fellow man when those
times present themselves as judges we
must remember if not us who
who is there to sit on the bench and try
to meet out justice
if not us you've been placed in an
unique
role in society a historic role that has
its origins in
every ancient city civilization that has
ever existed that should inspire us that
should inspire awe
how and why you rose to the bench is not
important but what is important is how
you do your job
how you try to deal with society's
problems and how you tackle
cases not as a case but as a problem
that has greatly
and usually negatively impacted the
lives of those who are before you
how are you going to solve that problem
for people who cannot
solve it for themselves
that's what we do and i believe the god
wouldn't have placed you on the bench if
she hadn't had confidence that you're
the ones that can handle the job
essential to doing that job of a judge
is to value the goal of equal impartial
justice
under the law in america we have risen
to meet that goal
countless times we have failed many
times as well
our obligation is to drive closer to
that goal each hour of every day
in accordance with the constitutions of
our state and our nation
protest and civil unrest this past
spring
and summer were spawned by the death of
george floyd
an unarmed handcuffed black man by the
police in
minneapolis but the resentment of the
protesters towards our governmental
systems
including the judiciary is not the
result of that one
incident alone the history of our nation
is one of immense contradictions we have
founders who have envisioned quality
for all while owning slaves laws and
court decisions discriminated against
fellow americans on the basis of their
race
and their gender barriers enacted by
lawmakers and upheld in courts have
restricted access to
capital and certain neighborhoods based
on skin color
the list of injustices is long and the
effects have reached from one century
into another into another the
inequalities linger
and they persist but our founders
embedded in their hallowed documents the
instruments of change
change for the better is a hallmark of
our system of government
but it requires steadfastness it
requires
protest the suffragists that we honor
this year
on the 100th anniversary of the women's
right to vote
worked on this project across several
generations
and for more than 70 years they took
their protests to the streets
countless times suffragists were the
very first people to demonstrate at the
white house
they held silent vigils with banners and
signs
all the while dressed in white it drove
woodrow wilson crazy
they were spat upon they were harassed
they were threatened
and not just by men but they were
undaunted and for that
i am grateful change for the better is
possible as leaders of the judiciary we
are duty bound to continue finding new
ways to make progress
in the administration of justice
doing so requires tools we have a lot of
tools already
we have our research capabilities we
have bench cards the judicial college
the conference
etc we have our bar associations
judicial organizations and we have each
other but when it comes to fairness from
the bench
and sentencing we still lack the number
one tool
employed by every successful business in
this country
that tool is advanced metrics
measurements
for us this means metrics on sentencing
and the outcome of court proceedings
we gather reams of judicial data the
statistical summaries from the supreme
court of voluminous
but we don't go nearly far enough to
know how fair
and equitable we are or can be when we
make the most important decisions facing
us
as judges our lack of knowledge about
sentencing reverberates in the public as
lack of confidence in you
and me and our judicial system 21 years
ago
then chief justice tom moyer
commissioned a report on racial fairness
that called for comprehensive statewide
sentencing database
nearly every state has a report a
commission a blue ribbon panel
seeking the same thing to no avail
it's difficult to do that's the main
excuse
in our digital age manufacturers can
track
thousands even millions of parts in a
day and ship them directly into the
hands of a specific worker
or or customer once installed they can
follow the quality of these components
and the experiences of their customers
there are many other examples like that
in the business world
so yes establishing a sentencing
database may be hard
but it is not impossible and more
importantly
it is necessary here's what we need to
know
what sentence did courts impose for each
felony offender and what was the record
of the offender
what was the race of the offender how
many people were sentenced to a specific
felony offense this year and at what
level
what number were placed in diversion
programs how many were put on court
ordered community control
and so many more data points our goal is
to answer these questions
and and many more by bringing together
the data of the courts and those of law
enforcement prosecutors probation
officers
correction departments etc this
information
exists but it's not collected and
aggregated and that's the shortcoming
it's inside more than 300 courts in 88
county
silos and agencies and departments
around the state
this information that this is the
information
that we need in order to be able to
make sense and to report what is
happening in our courts
you as a judge are being forced to fly
blind and that's not fair to you
it's important that our judge is
sentenced with consistency
judges and lawyers should have tools to
know what the data shows regarding
sentencing for each offense
statewide given the cost of
incarceration
both monetary and in human terms
consistency and predictability
need to be measured it is a public that
is demanding more equality in the
judicial system
and law enforcement and more
transparency and rightfully so
for the public to be informed and for
truth to win out over
rumor and fiction they must be able to
see justice for
all and understand how it is measured
this is the path to faith in our system
and it is the path that we must pursue
metrics and transparency are on the side
of the public
and it's on our side we simply have to
act
the ohio criminal sentencing commission
and a group of dedicated judges and
court personnel
have worked to make aggregation of
sentencing data a reality
the first deliverable is proposed
uniform sentencing entries
this will be this will set the stage for
data gathering and analysis
by academia the university of cincinnati
ohio state and case western reserve are
already involved
initially a pilot program of one or more
counties will be created
the pilot will allow for the development
and the identification
of what works and what does not and that
pilot
as that pilot moves forward we will
increase the number of counties
participating and we will be asking
for your help your reward will be an
increase in the public's trust in the
judiciary
and a fantastic tool to help you every
day
judges want to be fair we strive to be
fair
this database will give us a foundation
for fairness and objectivity that will
change how we do our jobs
and it will be a change for the better
four years ago we set out to tie
together data and criminal information
across
all kinds of political and
organizational borders
in eight states this included all the
large and small bureaus and agencies
and government branches in all these
states with different laws and practices
we tied them all together with academics
and the federal health officials
and the medical professionals we broke
down barriers
just as the theme of this conference
prescribes
we called it the regional judicial
opioid initiative
our joy it's an eight-state consortium
and it works this that task had never
been untaken
undertaken before but in ohio we led the
effort
and as i said it's a success we did it
other regions around the country have
copied our initiative and there's a
national effort as well
we can apply the same can-do attitude to
this sentencing project
actually we must do so
how can we explain to our citizens that
we knew this database
effort was critical to justice and our
state but we didn't do it
do we say we failed because we didn't
get around to it or because it was too
hard
that's not the spirit of innovation that
you as judges have so ably
demonstrated for years and particularly
the past six months
during this pandemic i believe that we
can do this
i believe that we will do it so once
again i want to thank the osb for
hosting us
and i want to extend best wishes to the
ojc
and hope that you all have a successful
conference
i'm going to close by recognizing two
judges who have lost their lives to
covet 19
two of our judges franklin county
municipal court
judge william paulette died as a result
of covet 19
quite unexpectedly and it was a shock
and retired judge joseph donofrio from
the seventh district court of appeals
also passed away um from covet 19.
our condolences to their families um and
to their colleagues and the people who
knew them they were both wonderful
gentlemen
i also want to close with a
a statement well just a preview
paul pifer asked me last night about
5 30. i think i got the email or the
text
can we do something about cle
requirements this year
for judges in light of the pandemic in
light of
the inability for some judges maybe to
acquire all of their
cle credits for those reporting this
year
i will tell you that there wasn't enough
time between 5
30 last night and and this morning to
investigate it as
thoroughly but i mentioned it to my
colleagues
we will be looking at it i can't promise
you know what direction it will go
i know that the commission uh for
continuing legal education is meeting
on the 18th of this month i've asked
them to look at it
so uh stay tuned we will try and come up
with something
whether it's extending the deadlines for
reporting
whether it's adjusting the number of
credits
etc we will we will not ignore this we
we have been looking at it thinking
about it and we will continue to do so
so
with that um i'm going to close uh i
wish you again a successful conference i
want to thank each and every one of you
please stay well be safe
wear your masks sanitize
and god bless you all
[Music]
you
