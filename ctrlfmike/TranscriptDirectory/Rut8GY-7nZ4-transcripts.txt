so
afternoon everybody
today i'm wearing a necktie from ohio
christian university
in circleville they're founded in 1948
as circleville bible college for the
purpose of educating
clergy for the churches of christ in
christian union
campus continues to grow and the
university continues to grow
while remaining true to its founders
vision ohio christian university has
expanded its outreach by becoming
credited by the higher learning
commission by being affiliated with the
association for biblical higher
education
and the council for christian colleges
and universities
eric let's go to the slides
so you'll see we're running about
average here
as far as cases we normally see a
downturn you see during the weekend and
the day
after the weekend so this is not too far
off kind of where it's been for 21 days
the deaths are are higher
and as i said last time just make sure
everybody understands how this is
done and how it's been done uh
throughout this
um sadly there were an additional 87
deaths reported
during the last 24 hours this is the
highest number of deaths
reported in a day since early may
as the third highest number since the
beginning of the pandemic but
to be clear not all these deaths
occurred in the past day
this is the number reported since the
data was
updated yesterday so it basically was
reported in a 24 hour period
key word is reported corners have
up to six months usually does not take
that long but they have up to six months
to certify a death certificate
so there can be a delay between the date
a death occurs and the date the death is
reported and many times that there
is um let's look at this chart
eric next one uh deaths reported
in last 24 hours by date of
death uh so you'll see back here
there's one case that occurred may 6
that was reported today
one in here somewhere in the latter part
looks like the latter part of june
uh july 25th but once you then get to
august 4th
basically all the deaths that are being
reported today occurred
during this basically a little over a
month period of time
anyway we just we just i get questions
about this and get emails and people
uh you know wonder kind of how this is
done
so we want to make sure that we explain
that correctly
so 83 percent of the deaths reported in
the past 24
hours happened in basically the last
month
let's go to the update in regard to our
88 counties again this
is looking back for a
two-week period of time per 100
000 population and looking at the
counties 1 through 88
as far as who had the most cases
based on population during that period
of time
so eric let's now go to the and this is
available up on our web page
let's go to the top ten
i'll just read them down uh putnam
mercer butler shelby henry
athens franklin montgomery dark and
miami
and again what you'll see here is most
of these are now
some of our more smaller smaller
counties
with several exceptions in here but most
of them are smaller
i wanted to talk about this last week
but we ran out of time
and it is something that is is important
uh ohio veterans hall of fame
it's a real honor to recognize the
achievements of so many remarkable
people
in our great state and certainly among
them ohio veterans
in 1992 my friend george vonovich when
he was governor created the ohio
veterans hall of fame
he recognized that veterans not only
serve
during their time in service but so many
of them when they come back home
continue to serve and just do amazing
amazing things and so what this
is is a recognition of those things that
they've done since they
come home a total of 895
uh of ohio's veterans have been inducted
now into the hall of fame
today i'm pleased to announce that a new
class of veterans
will be joining this distinguished group
of heroes and you'll see their names
here
on on this slide uh the class of 2020
listed on the screen includes 20 men and
women
representing four branches of the armed
service and representing 16 of our ohio
counties
outside of their military service each
has continued to serve our country as
well as this great state
of ohio the veterans have served as
business owners
community volunteers scientists
advocates
engineers and many many more
although the pandemic will prevent us
from gathering in person to celebrate
this year
uh we're very grateful for each one
of our veterans and each one of the
veterans who we're honoring today
and our ohio department veterans
services will be presenting
each one of the recipients uh with your
medals
we'll also post a virtual ceremony
online on november 5th
at ohiovets.gov
so again congratulations to our ohio
veterans hall of fame
class of 2020. thank you so very very
much
for your service speaking of veterans
i want to wish uh ohioan asa newman
who is a tuskegee airman in world war
ii a very happy 102nd
birthday coming up mr newman grew up in
cleveland
now lives in ravenna so happy birthday
and thank you so very very much for your
service
so we talked last time about having uh
director mcelroy
uh here uh to talk really about
what's going on as far as testing uh you
know
in our nursing homes and some of our
other uh facilities
uh i think the director is on and uh
director can you
can you hear me i can hear you governor
director director is the director of
aging uh thank you very much for
joining us she's joined us i know before
but
um director talk to us a little bit
about and we'll start maybe with our
nursing homes
and about the testing that is is going
on now
in our nursing homes this has been
something that we started
with the ohio national guard very early
on
uh it has evolved what the testing in
the nursing homes
remains very very important so let's
start if we could with with our nursing
homes if you could tell us what's going
on in our nursing homes
absolutely so thank you sir and as you
know every action that we're taking
is so important in preventing the spread
and reducing the number of deaths
we know that for preventing the spread
across the country in the world
testing is one of the most critical
tools in our arsenal
and so when ohio's long-term care
facilities perform covet 19
testing on their staffs they're
screening in a preventive way
to catch early those who are positive so
that the spread is stopped
we know that the risk is real and the
result for older loved ones can be
devastating
and so we continue to build our
capabilities to have rapid and
widespread testing available
so in summary in our nursing homes we
test for three reasons
one if someone is symptomatic if a
person exhibits signs or symptoms of
covet 19 they must be tested
and in the case of a staff person they
are expected to be restricted from the
facility pending results of those tests
two if someone tests positive in a
nursing home
all resident and staff are tested
this is because it's important to have
rapid identification and isolation of
new cases
to stop further viral transmission
then three we have what's known as
routine staff testing based on the
extent of the virus in the community
and so i think it's also important to
note that
the facilities are subject to specific
reporting requirements and they must
demonstrate compliance with
these testing requirements if there is
non-compliance enforcement remedies can
be imposed
and in many of these cases we are
offering some assistance some state
supported assistance
for example the guard still assists by
picking up specimens and delivering them
to the lab
so that so our the involvement today
with the guard
started off the guard was doing the
swabbing if i
remember correctly but what the guard is
doing now
uh in in a number of cases is picking up
basically from the nursing home and
taking to to the lab
correct correct one of our strategies
was to build
self-sufficiency so that the strategy
could
be sustainable and so in many cases the
facilities have the capability to do
their own specimen collection
and we assist with helping with in some
cases the packaging and definitely the
transport
to the lab and the testing itself is
supplied how
the test the the the kits or
whatever is used yes so again with the
state support we provide the kids
and and that's those are the kits that
we assist with when we go to pick up
and deliver to the labs okay so the labs
that
these labs for the nursing homes then
would be
in the state of ohio basically is that
right right
we primarily um we do use other labs but
we can have lab capacity
uh we're going to use that capacity so
okay
let's let's go to assisted living and
kind of tell us with the
assisted living and then maybe to give
an idea for
everyone who's watching let me go back
to the nursing homes
uh we have approximately how many
residents in nursing homes
in in ohio uh so when you begin to talk
about nursing homes between staff and
nursing
between staff and residents you're
looking at about upward of 160
000 people that have to be tested um so
it's a pretty good split between staff
and residents but you've got a
lot of people that have to be tested
okay let's move to
to the assisted living and
those numbers would be what about the
same as
as in nursing homes or um somewhat
different um assisted living facilities
we have about 770 of those
throughout the state you're looking at
about 80 000 or so people that have to
be tested
so it's a little different assisted
living facilities have a different
structure oftentimes they're configured
different than a nursing facility but
still have people who have high care
needs within them
and in the in the assisted living what
what is how's the testing
done now and how often is it done what's
the protocol
today so right now they are on
every other week testing cadence
i think it's important to note that
here in late august we we certainly
were providing state support assistance
we were notified by the assisted living
facilities a small number of some
testing data inconsistencies and
and so we did quickly pause so we can
address the source of that problem
we now know that we have identified the
source
and we are excited to resume our state
supported testing
so that will be starting this week i
think correct we're ready to go this
week
absolutely and again
in regard to just make sure
i'm correct uh assisted living that
testing
that national protocol is for staff
every
every two weeks all right this is what
we've at
here within our state we have customer
assistant living facilities to test
every other week minimally
so to the extent that the facility
perhaps
has the capability to test more we
certainly want to encourage that but at
a minimum every other week
is the expectation okay
um let's go to adult day care i know
we've had questions about that
adult daycare i believe is going to
start back up they can start back up on
the 21st
yeah you want to give us a little
overview of what's going on as far as
what will be going on as far as testing
there absolutely so we're excited adult
day centers are permitted to reopen on
the 21st
on their very valued sector of our
long-term care
continuum they often provide a lesser
restrictive alternative
to some of their facility care
but throughout the pandemic their
congregate services did remain closed
for a great period of time their testing
will include testing for
staff and participants minimally every
other week
and this is really important due to the
the the fluid nature of adult day
the participants come and go each day
the staff have to come and go each day
so
we'll stick really closely with
ourselves
partnering with our adult day partners
so that we can provide the support they
need in this testing environment
okay and what about our senior centers
they're
allowed to open again on the 21st and
how
how are you going to how are we handling
that absolutely and it's a wonderful day
for a lot of communities as a place for
recreation preventative care the
benefits of bounds with our senior
centers and
again as you mentioned they too have
been closed for congregate services
since march
and so we're ready to get them going
testing for them will be for all staff
again every other week participants will
be
on what we call a strategic testing sort
of model and that is if an individual
presents with symptoms
at that point we would ask that they are
required that they then
insist upon testing but otherwise
it is a cadence primarily for their
staff
and and with these adult daycare senior
centers
obviously if someone has a temperature
or someone has symptoms then that person
will be
you know the normal protocols we would
expect would be followed
absolutely i think it's worth noting
thank you for pointing that out governor
um this was adult day
senior centers nursing facilities
and assisted living facilities all of
these are very important groups
in addition to the testing they also
appreciate the need for infection
prevention and control
so that is the cleaning that is the
screening that is the maintaining logs
there is a significant amount of work
that goes into preparing
these particular sites for people to
come in safely
so all of those things must happen not
only
when they are able to reopen and start
but throughout
great director let me just close
by asking you about visitation in
nursing homes i get texts a lot i get
calls about visitation uh we opened up
uh
nursing homes to visitation uh a few
months ago what
july 20th they were able to begin
outdoor visitation
uh it was early june june 8th for the
assisted living facilities that is
correct the outdoor visitation is
is in play we certainly know that the
weather
uh is not on our side but we recognize
how important it is to have
ongoing connections and
having those relationships remain so it
is not our plan to do anything to
disrupt those connections in fact we're
working really hard
to be able to bolster those connections
here really soon and so
i look forward uh to coming to you and
you being able to announce here very
soon uh what we have in store
for indoor visitation and if i might add
one last thing sir
in addition to that because we have
heard so much from families
we've also worked in ways to enhance our
transparency around visitation
and so we are working really hard to
here soon stand up
a dashboard if you will something public
facing where
our families our loved ones can see
what visitation looks like in their
respective communities what type of
visitation
when you can visit and and if it has
fluctuated based upon
the case spread in that community or
that facility
so i know uh you you and i get calls
and you get a lot more than i do but
about people who say look i can't visit
my loved one in a nursing home
what's usually going on there it could
be a variety of things
sometimes visitation has to pause
because
maybe there has been a spread
of cobot 19 within that particular
facility
it could be a situation where there is
significant community spread where the
facility sits
they're just a host of reasons and then
one thing i would encourage
people if you have a question if you
have concerns if you have not been able
to have those meaningful connections
we always want you to reach out to our
office at the ohio department of aging
in particular our state long-term care
ombudsman
so that we can look into the matter
we serve as an advocate and we certainly
want to do anything we can
to safely restore those connections good
director thank you very much we
appreciate it thanks for all
the good work that you do thank you sir
appreciate it
eric um i forgot to couple the slides uh
if we could go to
three three slides we'll start see which
one comes up first
uh i asked our team uh a week or so ago
to kind of do
an analysis of where we are
and with every state surrounding us so
i just might be of interest this first
slide is cases per hundred thousand
based on population by the state so um
as you can see pennsylvania's at 5.8
we're at 8.3 and then we
move up from there so ohio is
right here this is ohio this is where we
are
where we are today um let's take a look
at the next slide
eric uh this is positivity you know we
talk about
positivity um
again we are 3.6 we've been around 3.6
3.8 4 point in that area
michigan is below us at 1 and then you
can see the other
states as we move up and the last one
eric
number of tests per 100 000 so these are
the tests
the number of tests that are actually
being done
we hire the banner of course and
here's where we are at this point so
we're not where we want to be
uh we're below michigan uh we continue
to push uh to get more testing
so that just kind of an interesting
comparison with
the states that do surround us and you
know each one has a different
situation uh each governor is working
very hard to
deal with the problems in their health
department to deal with the problems
they have in their state but it's always
just interesting to see what
what other states are doing let me move
now to
ohio to work program ohio's economy
like the rest of the country has
certainly been impacted by the pandemic
we're working hard to support ohioans
and ohio's business as they get back
to work today we're announcing a new
initiative
uh that will help ohioans who are
looking for a job to have a better
chance of finding
that job led by jobs ohio and the ohio
department of jobs and family services
along with the governor's office at
workforce transformation
and the ohio development service agency
the new initiative
is called ohio to work ohio to work
this new program brings together
employers
non-profits educators training providers
to help ohioans
reskill and restart their careers
ohio to work will help someone who is
out of work to identify a new career
opportunity
train for it and then be placed with an
employer
we know it can be a challenge to find a
job right now but
we also know that employers are hiring
in industries such as healthcare
technology advanced manufacturing
our program will provide career coaches
to identify
person skills if they need additional
training for a new career opportunity
ohio to work also in addition to the
coaches
will coordinate virtual career fairs and
connect ohioans looking for a job
directly with employers looking to hire
the first ohio to work initiative will
be launched in cleveland cuyahoga county
and we hope to expand the effort to
every single part of the state in the
months
ahead right now we have more than 30
employers who already have signed up
with the ohio to work initiative all
these employers have committed to us
to interview people who have
participated in the initiative
and they have worked with our ohio to
work partners
j.p nausife is going to join us now jp
is the president chief investment
officer of jobs ohio
uh he's going to tell us more about how
this program is going to work
jp very exciting tell
tell our viewers exactly how this this
program we hope it's going to work
well thank you very much governor dewine
the ohio to work
was formed to address the unprecedented
number of ohioans
who filed for unemployment due to the
impact of covid
more than 500 000 ohioans have been
displaced since march
so jobs ohio hasn't traditionally been
involved in developing workforce in ohio
but this is a time of exceptional need
and our board of directors agreed that
if we could help
then we should help jobs ohio as you
know is unique
amongst state level economic development
organizations in america
our private structure independent and
stable funding
and strong statewide network of partners
enables us to adapt
very quickly as needs arise such as this
pandemic
ohio to work is new it's a collaborative
effort designed to address this need by
supercharging and optimizing the current
workforce development ecosystem
to deliver comprehensive yet personal
training
career placements and other services
that ohioans need
and that they deserve by increasing
coordination among all the partners we
hope to increase their ability to help
someone who is out of work
to connect with coaching training
and help them on their way to restarting
their careers
ohio's employers are key to this
initiative
a governor you as we saw already in the
presentation
over 30 have signed on in the cleveland
area alone
many of them helped design the program
in terms of identifying the best way for
ohio and seeking work
to connect with employers and employment
opportunities
technology is going to play a vital role
as well
ohio to work partners are making use of
the best tools available in the
marketplace today
including artificial intelligence
intelligence
to help point people on a path not only
to an open job
but to a sustainable higher paying new
career
that means it's not just a
one-size-fits-all approach and that's
what makes it so exciting
each ohioan using the program will be
heard and a coach will be assigned and
we'll work with them
to find the pathway that's best for them
and we can and we must do it very fast
because
the need is there we will also be
launching virtual career fairs as early
as october
as a way to make connections between
workers and employers
even during an evolving pandemic
but one of the things we're most proud
of is ohio to work's commitment to
diversity and inclusion
the unemployment rate where we're
piloting this program in cuyahoga county
is 12.9 percent it's the highest
unemployment rate in ohio
and it's over thirteen percent of the
total unemployment average in the state
and of that forty percent of the
unemployed in
calgary county are african-americans
compared to just 20 statewide so we
believe
for ohio's recovery to be sustainable
it must be inclusive of all ohioans
and we've created partnerships with the
urban league with goodwill
to ensure representation communication
and equal access
with underrepresented populations we're
very excited about this effort governor
and looking forward to kicking it off
well great uh thanks for
jp for telling us about this so if
someone is out there watching this
right now or if they maybe see it on the
news tonight
how do they get started on this let's
say i'm looking for a job
what's my entry point what do i do the
best thing to do is go to
ohio2work.com it's ohiotowork.com
and that's where you'll find the roadmap
that's where you'll be
unemployed worker will be connected to a
coach and the tools and resources to
guide them through this process
and one things i i think i find exciting
about this is there is a coach there is
someone to help you
go through this go through this process
we know that we have
jobs that are available out there we
also know that we have people who are
unemployed
sometimes those can be matched up
sometimes
someone's skills have to be enhanced so
this is really kind of taking a
a holistic approach but a very
individual
approach uh to to the person so if they
go to that right now is that up now
it the site is online now exactly yes
sir it is we soft launched it uh
earlier uh and i'm happy to say that
each each person will be assigned a
coach this is a very motivated group of
people they
they've been provided technology and
very recent information about the
businesses and the industries that
they'll be
advising on and our partners at the
urban league
at ohio means jobs and at goodwill
already
but the best place to start is
ohio2work.com
okay jp thank you very much appreciate
it thanks for
sharing that with us in a moment we're
going to turn to two of our
superintendents uh this is something
i've enjoyed doing is hearing
from superintendents around the state
what exactly they're they're doing but
before that i want to just
say that we are obviously all ohioans
are thinking about
uh those who are in the path of the
hurricane
whether it be louisiana alabama florida
and we're certainly thinking of them
we're also thinking of everyone out west
who has been impacted by by the fires
and we do have
ohio men and women who have traveled
west this year and to help
fight the fires i'm really proud
of what they have done so far this
summer 21 individuals
from the ohio department of natural
resources have been engaged in fighting
those fires
here are some of the assignments three
firefighters in california
25 four firefighters in colorado 20
20 firefighters in wyoming two
firefighters in oregon
and one firefighter in arizona that's
been this summer
today currently we have three
firefighters in california two in oregon
and three that are just now i guess
starting to return
from colorado so we thank them uh for
their
strong work and we're thinking about all
those from
all the states who are out there
fighting fires and uh
we we pray for them and we pray for the
families that are
in the path of the hurricane and that
are dealing with the with the fires in
the aftermath of the fires
let's go now to our superintendents uh
today i've invited brookfield local
superintendent
timothy hopkins to join us brookville is
a small district a relatively small
district
in montgomery county superintendent
thank you
very much for joining us thank you very
much governor dewine thank you for
having me today
well tell us a little bit about uh real
quick how big your school district is
and uh you're you're basically on uh
in person right now i think
yes sir we uh we are a district of about
1500 total students so
at any given grade level we'll be
between 115 to 130 students
and located in the northwest corner of
montgomery county
today is kind of a landmark for us
within the next half hour
we will have completed four weeks of
school in person
so we're really excited about the fact
that uh our students were able to get
back into the buildings
reconnect with their teachers reconnect
with their peers
and it's been a very positive experience
for us so tell us a little bit about
what you've done and
what you're noticing how's it just kind
of how's it going
well i would just start with the fact
that um you know we
we bought into information from the
american academy of pediatrics that
the best place for students to be if
possible was in school in person
and uh each community had to make their
own decision
uh based on what was best for their
community but when we polled our parents
back in june
90 of those parents said we want our
kids back in school and so
we were able to bring them back into the
district
we started on august the 19th uh we like
to say that we're able to see them smile
even with their mask on we see the smile
in their eyes
and we've been really excited about
having them on campus
not just the fact that academically we
believe it's a
it's a plus but also social emotional
health and nutrition they're just a lot
of different ways that
we believe it's a positive that they're
in the buildings
i would just share a couple of quick
stories with you maybe today governor
that
um one of the things that we did before
the school year started was that
we reached out to a local non-profit
organization who rented
picnic tables to festivals like
oktoberfest and obviously
they didn't have the ability to do that
this year because the festivals had been
canceled
so we rented about 60 picnic tables and
brought them in
and we've had the ability to split our
lunches and so every other day
our students eat outside at the picnic
table and
that's been a really big plus for us
it not only has freed up room in a
cafeteria for those students still
eating in the cafeteria to
social distance and be able to get apart
from each other but
every other day the students come we've
got a beautiful fall here in the miami
valley and so
every other day the students come
knowing that they're going to get to eat
outside at the picnic tables
obviously that's a time when they've got
to take their mask off in order to eat
and uh i've learned through actually
through your press conferences governor
that
we're 19 times less likely to catch cove
but when we're outside
and so we feel like that's been a real
positive our kids are enjoying the fresh
air
they're enjoying the opportunity to get
outside and that's one thing that we
could do
as a school district to help prevent
covid but still have students on campus
every day
well that's very innovative and i
imagine the students like that
that's kind of fun to get out get
outside particularly if it's a day
a day in the fall like this a little a
little cooler today but
pretty pretty good day how are your
teachers doing how your teachers and bus
drivers and everybody else who
people work in the office cafeteria how
they all doing
you know i think in general across the
board everybody's just happy to be
back in session um there's a there's a
huge win-win when
students from a community are able to
come to school every day and make eye
contact and
and reach out to teachers and teachers
can can develop that rapport bus drivers
we talk about the fact that they're the
first to see our students every day when
they pick them up
on the way to school cafeteria workers
paraprofessionals
uh across the board i just think again
we're one month then now we're excited
about that
we see a lot of positive attitudes
we developed a little refrigerator
magnet that we passed out to every
student to begin a year with the
covid19 checklist of what you need to
make sure you bring to school each day
and at the bottom of that was a positive
attitude
and we've seen that with both our
employees and our students
and everybody seems excited to be here
and and uh really
really pushing forward well thanks for
skyping in with us today and
interrupting your day and
good luck to your thank your teachers
and all your all your team
and good luck to you at brookville and
uh
sounds like you're doing some uh neat
and innovative things so we
thanks for sharing we appreciate it
thank you governor
we appreciate being here and sharing
those ideas with you
thank you you go now to robert o'leary
the superintendent of vandalia butler
schools
also here in the miami valley
mr superintendent how are you doing
doing very well today governor dewine
how are you doing
i'm i'm well i see you got the purple
behind you there we can't miss that
so it's good tell us a little bit about
uh
how school's going and and how big is
your district how many students in
k-12 so we're about 3 000 students in
our
in our district so things are things are
going very well and uh to start you know
again thank you
it's an honor to be a guest on today's
press conference
uh so i don't disappoint my team here in
vandalia butler city schools and my
colleagues in montgomery county the
superintendents
and some colleagues across the state i i
like to start off
all of my zoom meetings uh putting on a
different type of uh
ppe here today so wow
gotta make sure that i don't disappoint
i i do most of those new meetings with
that on at least to start
so there's still is there a story is
there is it more of a story behind that
or is that just your uh
there there actually is there's there's
two levels to this one um
every year except for this year we start
off uh well we did it this year just in
a different way but we start off our
uh opening day with staff as uh with a
costume theme
and uh two years ago we did uh
your favorite superhero so i chose
captain america and then actually
ironically during the uh
the quarantine and shutdown with out all
the evening events and a little more
time with the family we decided to watch
the entire
avengers movies in the order in which
the story goes which
was enlightening and very fun to do so
that's great
that's great well tell us how you're
doing and what's what's going on in
school
uh so we're doing doing very well we
started uh we we completed three weeks
on friday
uh we uh chose in person uh based off of
feedback that we had from our
our parents about 84 of our parents
chose the in-person
model and 16 chose a an all
online or remote option uh so things
have gone
very well with the the in-person
delivery we have a couple
uh hiccups and kinks to work through on
our online uh delivery
but we're working diligently on that um
it's like we've said in uh
different um conversations with uh
staff and parents we've we've been
educating students in this community
since
1807 in person and uh
you know even that we we change year to
year so we've been doing the
this online remote program for a little
more than two weeks
and so you know we need a little more
time to to adjust and
tweak and make that better but we
continue to work hard on that but the
the start of the school year uh feedback
that we've had from teachers
who've been here for for years i know
there was apprehension
from some to to begin the year lots of
different uh
protocols and processes in place but uh
you know i
i one one uh quote from a teacher
with almost 20 years experience said
that it was her best
uh first day of school she's ever had so
uh
well we're off to a great start well
that's that's great so
we always try to look for different
things uh any unique things that you may
have come up with
you want to tell us about anything
you're doing that you're particularly
excited about
keep keep kids safe yeah similar to tim
with the outdoor thought in july i
received an email from a grandparent in
the district who's
also a doctor um and in the email she
attached an article and at the end of
the article there was kind of a little
story about
during the tuberculosis pandemic how
some some schools in some cities
uh use the concept of using tents for
outdoor classrooms
so that was uh pretty early in july
so we kind of put that one on the shelf
as we were continuing our planning and
getting
feedback uh from staff and parents on uh
the delivery models but that's something
that we ended up moving forward with
in fact i reached out to a
tent vendor a party tent vendor and
we've rented four 30 by 60
uh outdoor tents so that that's uh an
additional 1800 square feet of
of flexible space for our two
elementaries that had served
kindergarten through third grade
our fourth and fifth grade building and
our middle school that served six
through eight
we chose not to do it at the high school
because the high school
has more space and some bigger areas
where we
were better able to space students out
so we work closely with our city of
vandalia the township montgomery county
on the permit process because there's
obviously
permits and safety things we have to
consider as we
installed those um but as our community
always does they rally around us and
support us and
we moved through that uh pretty quickly
and a couple days after the first uh
first day of school we had those tents
put up so
across the district i've seen our a
multiple disability classroom at our
fourth and fifth grade building
utilize the tent for outdoor learning
space
i've seen our middle school utilize it
for
for band uh where we were able to be
outside and
space people out uh and both our
elementaries have
utilized that as well uh for outdoor and
extended learning spaces and flexible
spaces so
our morton middle school principal even
used the tent yesterday for a staff
meeting
the weather was beautiful and they took
advantage of the beautiful weather to
get outside in space
and and have a staff meeting so some
really good stuff going along that way
some other things that we've done uh
one of my elementary buildings um demet
principal and pe teacher divided the the
playground into quadrants
uh to kind of use as a concept for uh
creating a little bit of a bubble with
our
you know individual classrooms and
visually allowing them to see spaces
again for them to move freely but also
keep distance
uh one of our element the other
elementary healthy is uh
they can't do their typical pumpkin
patch uh
this year so we're bringing the pumpkin
patch to hellkey and uh
gonna allow students to you know
individually go out and pick their
pumpkin for the fall
um so just you know across the board
doing some really
neat and innovative things and as as i
said earlier our high school is doing a
great job
of just utilizing the spaces uh that are
available to them to to space students
out
well that's great very innovative using
spreading people out putting them
outside
and doing doing different things so uh
thank you very much for that uh
report and uh good luck to team at uh
vandalia butler and all the people that
work there and
all the students and we hope you
continue to have a good year and thanks
for
taking time out of your busy schedule to
skype in and tell us about it
i appreciate the opportunity i'd be
remiss to not thank premier health our
medical partners
their premier and dr allen for all the
support that they've given us
um in helping us develop plans and work
through situations as well as the
uh health department um as as we
continue to
implement the processes and procedures
and the guidelines
great thank you we appreciate it thank
you very very much
um moving on to universities just
quickly
um spent some time uh this week on the
phone with our health departments and
i've also
talked in regard to the universities and
you know kind of again what we're we
continue to see
uh is it would certainly appear that
the kids who are back in class uh are
doing okay in class they're doing okay
in the
probably in the library and even um
you know students who are back in
dormitories
uh but where uh according to the college
presidents what they tell me
is where we're really seeing the the
problem is just kind of same way with
everybody else you know people getting
together and
not being careful not wearing a mask and
so i guess
the message to students from from
college presidents is if you want to be
able to stay
have a good year you know we're gonna
have to take some precautions we're
gonna have to do some things in a normal
year obviously we would
we would not do so i guess i would just
add to that
uh you know if you can wear a mask in
class uh we're a mask
walking around campus you know when you
do something social
uh bring uh people together uh
you know just wear masks be careful uh
as we've heard from our two
superintendents if you can do something
outside you can be outside
uh generally it's gonna be safer than
than being inside
so we think we're ready for for
questions
governor first question today is from
laura hancock cleveland.com
hello governor um hi
um on sunday our reporters saw a lot of
football fans
at bars in the cleveland area not
observing
social distancing and other rules to
prevent the spread of covid
we haven't seen a lot of citations as a
result of that
on this thursday night the browns play
their first game at home
how concerned are you about this will
there be any renewed effort for agents
to monitor bars on thursday night
well it's football season and there
certainly is ample opportunity for
people to get together and watch
football
brown's bengals game is always always a
fun game two great quarterbacks this
year and
great other players so you know it's
going to be a fun uh
fun opportunity for everybody but we
just look we just tell people to be
careful
um you know i know that football brings
a lot of people out who want to kind of
congregate together and we understand
that but um you know the biggest spread
we see
uh is when people are congregating
together uh
and you know as far as our borrowers are
concerns the vast majority of our
borrowers
people own them people run them are
doing a good job same with restaurants
um you know we do have agents out from
liquor control
um you know we saw the first first bar
uh that was lost their license i think
it was yesterday
it's not what we want to see but again
the agents will do
will do their job when they when they go
out and
you know many times people in the bar
make it very difficult
for people who are running the bar and
uh so
you know bar owners ultimately are
responsible but we would just
ask everyone help them out help your
your favorite bar
out don't create a problem don't have
such congregation that
uh you know there's there's a great
possibility or spread so yeah we look we
we we're concerned anytime that you have
people who are
coming together in in close proximity
together and a lot of people
but the you know the rules of the bar
rules of restaurants are people have to
be six feet
they cannot congregate together they
need to be seated
these are all the basic things that have
been in the rules for for some time i
think if people do that they can have a
good time
they can root for the bengals for the
browns and you know have a
have a good evening we also of course as
you know
that game is the first game uh there
will be six thousand uh
fans uh admitted they'll be in quadrants
uh in different
areas uh and again you know
based on their plan uh you know and
based upon our confidence in them we're
sure that the browns will do a very good
job
we're sure that the bengals when they
host a home game their second game will
do a good job as well next question is
from kevin landers at wbns
in columbus hello governor hi kevin
uh governor dr duvey seems surprised to
learn about the treatment dr
acton received and mentioned that as
reasons not to accept the position
did you withhold that information from
her did you believe her as that's the
reason
that she decided not to accept the
position and also just to kind of switch
tears a little bit
uh halloween uh is coming up uh you're
going to leave that to communities to
decide or is that going to be
something will step in and decide
whether or not that's safe enough to
happen
look local health departments as well as
the state health department will have
certainly have recommendations in regard
to halloween
i don't have those today you know look
as far as dr
duvey is concerned i take people at face
value
i've had people before tell me for
personal reasons they couldn't do
something
they couldn't take a job and or they
need to leave a job
when someone tells you it's personal
reasons you know
i move on because you have to respect
what that person is saying
um we had conversations i had
conversations lieutenant governor had
conversations and i know
um you know key members of my team uh
had
conversations with with her uh and i do
know that
some of the conversation came up in
regard to uh the demonstration for
example
uh that took place at dr atkins home
so um look i mean sometimes
things don't you don't fully grasp
things
this happens to me until you kind of get
into something
and then you see it more um
but i'm only only speculating um you
know we were
we were open uh with her
um but you know she called that night um
you all remember a press conference at 2
30 or something i announced it and
you know 7 30 or so i was getting a call
from
from my team and said that you know she
had she had called
and for personal reasons felt that she
needed to withdraw so i respect
that
next question is from jeff redick at
wsyx in columbus
thank you the follow-up on that governor
do you worry that
not only because she withdrew but
because dr duvey specifically called out
the treatment of a prior health director
in ohio that that would in any way
deter future candidates from this job
well
i think if the question is can we find a
a person to serve who's a very good
person to serve as health director
uh the answer certainly is is yes we
also
as you know have a vacancy and medical
director and so we're looking to fill
that position as well the previous
medical director
after being with the department many
years retired so these are two key
positions
certainly that we're trying to fill
we'll be able to fill them
next question is from andy chow at ohio
public radio and television
andy hi governor is is dr dube the first
to turn down the position or have you
offered this to other people who have
also turned it down
have you heard these concerns about
potential public harassment from other
candidates i would have to check
with laurel with ann but
i don't recall having
anyone else express to me uh that they
had a concern
about not serving because of that reason
we have certainly when you reach out to
a number of people um you know once in a
while someone's going to say no i'm not
interested in the job
but i'm not aware of anybody
saying that the reason they would not be
interested in the job would be
because of what happened in regard to dr
acton
so i'm not i'm not aware of that at all
i don't think that's happened
next question is from jack windsor at
wmfd in mansfield
hey jack hi governor uh yesterday a
federal judge in pennsylvania
issued a declaratory judgment that
struck down governor wolf's
business closures gathering limits and
his stay-at-home orders in that state
and the judge said quote even in an
emergency the authority of the
government
is not unfettered the liberties
protected by the constitution
are not fair weather freedoms in place
when times are good but able to be cast
aside
in times of trouble now the judge's
decision was based upon federal
constitutional
consideration so although at this point
the decision is
persuasive it's not binding on ohio
it may end up having implications here
perhaps so governor a simple but
important question today
you've said in the past wearing masks
abiding by
business restrictions and honoring
limits on social gatherings
is the way for ohioans to buy or earn
their freedom
do you believe that in the united states
freedom is something that citizens must
earn
or do you agree with the federal judge
the constitutional freedoms are granted
unconditionally to everyone at all times
not just when it's conducted
well we have a wonderful constitution we
are blessed with the constitution that
we have we're
blessed with the liberty that we have um
you know i i would i would go back to
what some of our founders said
uh you know these these these basic
rights do not come from government these
basic rights come from god
so i don't think you and i jack will
quarrel on that
uh what happened in pennsylvania i don't
know i don't think about the case i
don't know what their statute says
uh so i don't want you know i'm not
going to comment on on that
but you know liberties that we have the
the rights that we have
uh protected by our constitution um
i do not think it's unfettered i don't
don't think there's unlimited
i'm the or that my power or any elected
official's power
is is uh unlimited at all
so there's probably more you and i agree
on them
than you might think next question
is from jackie borchardt at cincinnati
inquirer
thank you governor um two two questions
here one will you be in zanesville with
the vice president tomorrow
and second what happened to the state's
efforts to bring antigen tests
uh and use them broadly here
yeah we're look we had conversations uh
yesterday four or five o'clock
uh with some of our lab people our lab
experts our testing experts uh
about antigen uh we think antigen is
a part of an overall strategy
uh and we will get be we will have that
be coming in
part of this is is how far along the
private sector
uh is in regard to development but we
i got a pretty good briefing on it or an
update on it and uh
you know we're we're all in in the sense
that that
pcr tests are important the antigen
tests are important they play a
different role
and they're both very very very
important
i'm not planning on being in in
zanesville tomorrow i'm always happy to
see the vice president come to ohio
and uh you know we welcome welcome him
to come
next question is from max philby at the
columbus dispatch
hey governor um we're approaching this
week
the deadline that your administration
had set for schools to report um
coveted case data uh should we expect to
see some of that on the state's website
this week or next week or when
oh yeah it's going to come basically
what the schedule that we we outlined we
hope for it too
and so you're going to you're going to
see those
look the schools are doing i think a
very good job
at least from what i can see um in
reporting that i think the local news
media is reporting uh we happen to live
in the dayton media market but i
i look at media from around the state
and uh
i think the media is reporting uh what a
lot of schools are in fact doing schools
are being being very open about many of
them have dashboards up
so we're going to do what we said we're
going to do and we're going to try to do
it in
the time we said we would do it
next question is from jim adi at w-h-i-o
in dayton governor governor if we can
let's go back to the protests and the
harassment that
dr acton faced and dr duvey chose not to
face
to what degree is this making your job
harder to
find that next person and would you
warn the candidates those potential new
hires
this is the kind of protests and
harassment that
potentially you would face when you come
here to take this job
well i don't think ohio is unique um you
know
jim we've seen protests against
governors we've seen protests against
health directors throughout this country
uh we know that these are issues that
are
can be divisive uh i've tried to do
everything i can so that we're
not divided uh as a state because i
think
that we need to be together uh and and
fight this battle uh together but look
we live in a country when people can
express their opinions they can do that
we are firm believers in the first
amendment they can go
demonstrate they can protest so i don't
think we're in a different position than
any other state that would be hiring a
health director
you know what you're looking looking for
is you know
somebody who has um you know the
qualifications to
to do to do the job
you know when you look at a health
department there's a lot of things
that you need you need you need the
management side of it which is very very
important
which is has a lot of similarities to
management of any organization
and it's a very important organization
uh it's part of it's the recruitment of
of good personnel that's a component
part
um you also have to have people in here
um
you know who can give give the governor
and give the rest of our team um medical
medical advice uh certainly dr
dr acton uh you know did that
but uh you know we're looking for a
medical director as well
and we're looking for a health director
and those two
those two positions kind of cover all
the things that i just
just kind of laid out so we'll we'll
find the right people and let me just
say i don't want to
get too concerned we have some very very
good people
at the health department right now some
of them been there a long time
we have during this pandemic
surged in people from other
departments and we will continue to do
that
people who are good managers uh people
who
can be of assistance and we've really
reached out
uh outside uh state government and
uh uh you know with our colleges and our
universities
um you know we've uh we're on the phone
a lot
with uh ohio state with with people from
ohio state people from
university of cincinnati uh you know
people from
case uh and i can just go on and on you
know
university hospitals cleveland clinic um
you know
these are people who have come together
to help us and any time i've asked them
you know be on 6 30 a.m call you know
yeah they're there
so you know we've pulled a lot of people
together
and i think that's what the public would
expect we are in a battle we're in a war
uh and it's not over i know we're
getting tired
but uh you know we have to continue to
rally we have to continue to fight this
and we've got some very very good people
who are helping me from all over the
state
some in government some out of
government and they're making a huge
huge difference
so uh it's it's a very strong team we've
got a couple positions to fill
but as the team is on the field today
it's a very
good team as i said but it's aided by a
lot of other good people who are not in
part of government next question
is from adrian robbins at wcmh in
columbus
hi governor thank you for your time
today as always uh
follow up to that you said ohio's not
alone in this and that's true but what
does it say about our state and the
climate here to people
who live here or people who are thinking
about moving here or even bringing a
business here that
we have multiple people who cite abuse
from the public as a reason they don't
want to work in public office
do you think this reflects poorly on
ohio
no look i mean look we're a state uh
of individuals um individuals who
were midwesterners where ohioans were
tough we're strong
and we're resilient and with that those
people who have
strong opinions and uh you know
i don't think would you know that this
in the
work environment i think it's a you know
it's a great opportunity
um to be involved in a great cause
uh you know my friend john mccain used
to always kind of
talk about uh you know giving yourself
to a cause bigger than yourself
uh and that's really what the people who
are involved
every day and this includes the health
department's 113 health departments
it includes hospitals it includes nurses
and doctors and health professionals
it includes my team uh but they're all
giving of themselves to something bigger
than their old lives or their own selves
so i am i'm excited about what we're
doing
um it's not me it's all the people we've
got and it's all ohioans who are in this
battle
and so we're in the middle of this
battle it is not over with i don't know
what percentage of it is gone
uh but you know we have we're fighting
with the tools that we have
uh until we get a vaccine uh and we
really get
into that with a large number of people
uh taking it
we're going to continue this battle with
the tools that we have and we're going
to fight with the tools we have what are
they
the ability to wear a mask the ability
to social distance
uh the ability to to to follow good
good hygiene making decisions like being
outside
if it's a choice of inside or outside
doing something going going outside
so these are all things that ohioans
have done well
i put the numbers up on there uh
compared us to other states and they're
all doing working hard
um and we're not trying to compare but
we're doing okay
uh we're we're doing okay but we have to
keep going
uh we've got we've got a ways to go we
can't let this slip away from us
if we want our kids to be in school then
we've got to continue to fight
and so uh it's a it's a cause that i
think is a
is a very very important cause um we'll
fill these these two slots and uh
but in the meantime we're battling on
next question is from noah blundo at
hannah news service
uh good after governor good afternoon
governor can you hear me
i can indeed yes thank you um
today the department of education
released uh school report cards that
don't have any grades on them and
missing a lot of testing data because of
how things had to go in the spring
because of the pandemic the legislature
is considering whether school should be
graded for this year whether
you know and people have suggested
students children shouldn't be tested
how do
what do you feel about how
students should be assessed this year
and how their districts
should be graded this year based on
how things are going so far well first
of all i fully recognize that this is
something that the legislature
decides i certainly can have an opinion
about it
you know i've talked a little bit to the
speaker and the senate president
i have a great deal of respect for both
of them and and the minority
leaders uh is as well so this is
something that we will be talking about
um what i have said is that i think
there has to be
enough tests uh so requisite tests
so that parents and schools kind of know
where they are
because this has been difficult i mean
we had a
we had a spring that was an unusual
spring
uh we're having an unusual fall we've
got some kids that are doing it
on remote so we need to be able to
measure that uh but i guess from
from my personal point of view the
consequences that go with that i'm not
so too excited about that uh i want to
know
i think people need to know where their
kids are uh but as far as
you know writing schools or ranking
schools and doing things like that and
other ramifications i'm not sure that
that's really
that important now i will point out the
obvious and that is that
the federal law restricts us
in this area and unless there's some
you know changes you know the federal
law is going to dictate
some of these tests that we don't have
any choice about
next question is from scott hallas at
the xenia daily gazette
hey scott hey how you doing today
i'm well sir good good um the ohio
controlling board
yesterday denied the request from the
secretary of state
uh to be able to pay for uh postage for
absentee ballots
you know in this in this tough economic
time where you know even mailing two or
three ballots
could cause a hardship for people and
where people don't want to get out and
vote
um how important was this request and
what what's your reaction to that
well to state my position uh i've made
this
shared it with the legislative leaders
you know i would
i'm in favor of that but
it was clear that the legislative
leaders and not just the leaders but
this legislature did not want to do that
but let me say
our secretary of state and local boards
i think are doing a good job everybody
in this state should have by now
received the application um
so they have the opportunity to go fill
that application in
uh friend i have them in inside the
house
and send it in and then as soon as the
day comes when those
absentee ballots can be sent out they
can be sent out so
it's it's really i think a pretty easy
process and procedure someone does have
to
fix a stamp to it there's no doubt about
that but i think it's a pretty
easy process i think ohio does a good
job
we have voting for four weeks you can
vote if you want to vote in person you
can go to your
local board of elections and vote when
you get down to the last weekend or so
you can vote on sunday you can vote uh
other times and you can look look that
up if you want to wait till election day
fran i usually wait till election day
you know you've got 13 hours to go vote
6 30 in the morning to 7
30 at night we're used to though
uh having people vote absentee
and we've done it i think for about two
decades or so
and so that's something we're used to
now i would expect at least the
secretary of state tells me that the
numbers requesting that are up
so we would expect those numbers to be
higher but
with or without the state paying for the
stamp
i think that we we're going to run a
very good election and i think people
have
every opportunity out there to vote and
we're a
state that that values that
and i think we'll be fine
next question is from jake zuckerman at
the ohio capitol journal
hey jake hi governor you've cited john
berry's history
of the 1918 flu pandemic a few times at
these briefings
and on the last page of that book barry
says the following about lessons to
learn from the spanish flu pandemic
uh direct quote here those in authority
must retain the public trust
the way to do that is to distort nothing
to put the best face on nothing
to try to manipulate no one quote
even the president's remarks that he
downplayed the virus early on to avoid a
kind of panic
do you think the president ever learned
that lesson
well i thought you were asking about me
actually what we're doing in ohio
um look i mean i read the book um
i i think generally
most political scientists and historians
would say you know
when you get a crisis like this um you
know
i i've tried to be as open as i can
we continue to learn about the pandemic
so you know when we would have said
early on because this was the guidance
and what everybody thought well
mask was not that important it turned
out that was wrong
so i think that you know you for me i've
got to be
what i tried to do is tell people what i
know when i knew it
and but we continue to evolve of what
and what we know that certainly is true
for uh
any governor it certainly is true for
the president so i'm not gonna i'm not
gonna get in a
critique of the president i'm not gonna
do that uh
as i've expressed you before um
when i've called the white house when
i've called the president when i've
called the vice president
they have been very very responsive um
we are on a call every single week with
the vice president sometimes president
usually the vice president
and you know two hours usually and back
and forth
and it's it's all about people kind of
looking into the problem and figuring
out okay well what can we do to help you
and what do you need and that's that's
how the white house has has
been and that's been my as governor of
the state of ohio
representing the people of ohio that's
been my relationship with the white
house
next question is from alex ebert at
bloomberg
thanks for having us governor last week
president trump
said during a rally that he's
responsible for
a boom in auto plant creation in ohio
michigan and other states
that's not the case ohio hasn't had any
new auto plants break ground
during his tenure do you feel the need
to correct the president
on his economic development record and
if so what should ohioans think about
the state of auto manufacturing in ohio
well no i mean look we're always looking
for for new jobs
but uh i mean let's look at what's going
on in in lordstown now
um you know i was there
a month or so ago john was there um and
you know we're starting to we're going
to be starting to build electric
trucks in in wardstown um
you know we didn't like the gm plant
moving on
but uh you know people in lordstown and
people in mahoning valley are tough and
strong and
and we tried to help as well and as
local officials did and we said look
let's
let's move on and uh you know bring jobs
in for that plan so i'm very optimistic
about what's going to happen
about making trucks electric trucks in
lordstown
if you look at the investment general
motors has in other parts of the state
other companies we continue to you know
be a major
car state we've always been as well not
only a major
producer of cars but a major producer of
parts for cars so look we're we're
moving forward
governor our next question is today's
last question and it belongs to
jim province of the toledo blade hey jim
hello thanks again governor um a lawsuit
was filed since your last uh
briefing in putnam county that
challenged your mask order
and i know you don't like to talk about
litigation but what do you think of the
fact that this lawsuit was filed in the
same county that you listed today
as being number one in your ranking of
counties when it comes to the spread
rate
i don't think anything of it anybody can
file anything in court one of the first
things they teach you in law school is
hey you want to file something you can
walk in and file it doesn't mean
you're going to win but it takes one
person
that wants to file a lawsuit and i've
been sued so many times
during this and was assumed many times
when i was attorney general so i make
nothing
i make nothing of it and i turn it over
to uh
david yost and the lawyers and we kind
of we kind of
we kind of move on
well i want to thank everybody uh very
very much
and we look forward to seeing you
on thursday uh unless there's something
comes up between now and then we'll see
you on thursday thank you very much
everybody has a good good fall day
[Music]
