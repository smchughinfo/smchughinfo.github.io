    "uh virtual or or you have some in",
    "in class or how does that work so",
    "currently",
    "we are virtual uh fully virtual",
    "but we are looking forward to opening",
    "our school back up later this month",
    "to host some of the students who are",
    "ready to return",
    "and we're also preparing to continue",
    "that virtual instruction for families",
    "who choose to do so",
    "for the the second quarter and and what",
    "might be unique challenges that you're",
    "facing now with with with your students",
    "um any besides something that maybe",
    "um another teacher might be facing",
    "what what's unique so our students",
    "um that we the students that we serve",
    "are",
    "in our school use american sign language",
    "as their primary language and so we are",
    "using uh technology that we received",
    "last year thankfully",
    "right in time in march to access that",
    "communication",
    "and be able to provide that direct",
    "instruction to students",
    "through the online learning we also",
    "are looking to using masks when we",
    "return and that's going to be an",
    "additional barrier that we are working",
    "through",
    "our school is preparing virtual lessons",
    "online",
    "uh also providing individual pdpe",
    "for our staff that might have clear",
    "masks",
    "where you will have that visible window",
    "and with that window that will",
    "provide that additional access to",
    "american sign language",
    "and so um in in that classroom",
    "uh explain to me how this works",
    "you were you were signing for us at the",
    "beginning",
    "and so somebody in your classroom is",
    "that how they're getting your",
    "course generally from you yes so",
    "typically every day i will be using sign",
    "language um without the use of my voice",
    "in class",
    "and that will be our primary mode of",
    "instruction",
    "throughout the day one of the one of the",
    "challenges",
    "of being completely virtual since the",
    "pandemic has been",
    "not having those students that we've",
    "missed all this time",
    "but also those students uh missing",
    "school and their teachers and having",
    "that",
    "regular communication in our school for",
    "their their access to language",
    "throughout the day",
    "so i imagine you and the students are",
    "looking forward to kind of getting back",
    "together in class absolutely absolutely",
    "um i had the opportunity and i know a",
    "lot of",
    "ohio's teachers had the opportunity to",
    "drop off some supplies to their students",
    "over the summer and that was magic",
    "we miss them so much and we can't wait",
    "for them to be back",
    "we we've seen some of those social",
    "emotional needs",
    "and being able to connect with them in",
    "person from a safe distance with masks",
    "you know has has been a beautiful",
    "opportunity and we're really looking",
    "forward to",
    "continuing to provide that once we get",
    "back into into the building",
    "anthony one last question can you can",
    "you uh",
    "admire teachers very much and admire you",
    "um",
    "how did you become a teacher what what",
    "inspired you to do that what was your",
    "pathway sure um i think",
    "my story is probably this very similar",
    "to a lot of teachers out there",
    "just having a heart for kids and wanting",
    "to make a difference and",
    "i think uh we're in an opportunity right",
    "now where we can definitely do so",
    "um i attended flagler college in st",
    "augustine florida",
    "after graduating from hillyard city",
    "schools",
    "and took sign language courses and",
    "pursued it and returned home to ohio",
    "where",
    "i'm able to give back to the community",
    "like a lot of teachers out there",
    "i'm really proud to to serve with all of",
    "ohio's teachers",
    "so how many years you've been teaching",
    "now seven years",
    "seven years well thank you and we're",
    "glad you're in ohio",
    "and uh i know you'll be happy and your",
    "students will be happy to see you and",
    "get back into the",
    "into the classroom but thank you very",
    "very much and again congratulations uh",
    "there's so many good teachers out there",
    "and you're kind of the symbol",
    "of all of those teachers who are making",
    "a difference uh every single day anthony",
    "thank you",
    "i appreciate it thank you thank you very",
    "much eric let's go and look at the",
    "slides um we'll start off with our",
    "general",
    "slide unfortunately at 1",
    "335 new cases is what we're reporting",
    "um you know this is this is trending",
    "upward we're now",
    "um you can kind of see the trend of the",
    "last 21 days",
    "we're over now a thousand uh there was a",
    "time",
    "not too long ago when we were dipping",
    "below a thousand we're over a thousand",
    "now",
    "uh so we are concerned uh about",
    "about that uh let's go to the next slide",
    "eric which is really a kind of a new",
    "slide",
    "it's based on this same information that",
    "you have seen",
    "before but i thought it might be",
    "interesting we really have two things",
    "that we look at every week",
    "and on thursday we'll announce the new",
    "color code",
    "we'll give the new list for one through",
    "88 counties as far as the incidents and",
    "those are two really different ways of",
    "measuring",
    "um you know the situation that you have",
    "in your particular county so i think",
    "it's",
    "you know we wanted to kind of put these",
    "two together uh and so what you're gonna",
    "see on here",
    "is just the red the red counties",
    "uh right now and then the other counties",
    "that you see on here",
    "uh that are kind of a orange yellow i'm",
    "not quite sure",
    "what that is but uh the other color",
    "there",
    "uh are counties that have a high",
    "incidence",
    "um of of the virus",
    "um high uh counties are ones with",
    "greater than 100",
    "cases per hundred thousand population in",
    "the last",
    "two weeks and so the rest of these",
    "counties are counties that don't fall",
    "into either one of these categories so",
    "to summarize that these are the counties",
    "that we would worry the most about",
    "doesn't mean everybody else's doesn't",
    "have something to worry about",
    "but these are the counties these two",
    "color these counties",
    "are the ones that you have",
    "something something else you know",
    "they're at",
    "either high incident level or they are",
    "a red because they've met enough of",
    "those seven indicators",
    "so again we do kind of see a pattern",
    "uh over in the over in the western",
    "western side of the state",
    "but uh that's again a new map uh we'll",
    "put that up",
    "so people can see it it is a combination",
    "of",
    "several other maps and we kind of put",
    "them together in a different way",
    "to to look at eric let's go to our top",
    "20 ohio counties ranked by highest",
    "occurrence",
    "uh and again uh we start with mercer",
    "athens is now number two looks like",
    "putnam",
    "fulton dark defiance fayette",
    "henry wood all glazed and then we",
    "dropped to lawrence and we keep",
    "keep going from there again uh it's it",
    "is of interest",
    "just geographically most of these first",
    "of all are rural counties",
    "uh and in second with a couple of",
    "exceptions most of them are in",
    "northwest uh western part western part",
    "of the",
    "of the state uh let's go to the 88",
    "eric you're showing that one there and",
    "again that is up and people",
    "anyone can go take a look at those 88",
    "counties you can see where your county",
    "is ranked again",
    "this is by a number of cases uh the last",
    "the last two weeks let's talk for a",
    "moment about uh hospitalization",
    "hospital missions have been declining",
    "had been declining for many weeks since",
    "our peak in mid-july",
    "unfortunately we started to see that",
    "trend change",
    "a few weeks ago as a reminder hospital",
    "admissions are",
    "lagging indicator the data comes a",
    "little",
    "later as folks in the hospital go to",
    "some hospital for something",
    "that they need that kind of particularly",
    "that kind of care",
    "uh so let's look at several of these",
    "this is number of hospital admissions",
    "and you can start to see a trend",
    "this starts over here in april goes all",
    "the way across",
    "if you can't read it all to the week",
    "that we are into",
    "now these data fills in late sometimes",
    "so we might get information today that",
    "might indicate back here",
    "or might indicate here and so",
    "it's probably best not to look at this",
    "this week because it hasn't filled in",
    "fully but you do start to see",
    "a trend going up a little bit not marked",
    "on there yet",
    "uh but we see that trend",
    "our data team showed me some things this",
    "morning i want to share with you and",
    "they've taken hospital",
    "missions and they've really come up with",
    "a",
    "different ways of looking at this",
    "this is hospital admissions by",
    "age as we said earlier in august and",
    "september spread among the young and",
    "healthy",
    "we are afraid will eventually impact",
    "those who are older and more vulnerable",
    "the average age of covet cases",
    "and this is has gone up and",
    "unfortunately so is the average age of",
    "hospitalizations",
    "so this is a relatively new trend in",
    "fact in recent",
    "weeks ohio and 60 and older now account",
    "for about 70 percent of covert hospital",
    "admissions",
    "this is considerably higher than the 50",
    "percent that we saw in july",
    "um it's only natural i think to see",
    "older people",
    "the ones going to the hospital more but",
    "we have seen a marked change just since",
    "july again",
    "50 percent of the people going into our",
    "hospitals for coven",
    "in july were 60 years of age",
    "or older now that number is up to 70",
    "percent who are 60 years of age",
    "or older so again uh you can just",
    "you can kind of see and we'll make this",
    "available on our",
    "our web page um as as well",
    "what you see the colors the dark",
    "darker red purple uh this is",
    "this would be 70 to 79 this would be",
    "this would be 80",
    "plus so you can look at these colors and",
    "these are the two interesting they're",
    "all interesting but you can look at",
    "these two colors and what you will see",
    "is that the older population you know is",
    "is taking more",
    "percentage of those cases going to the",
    "hospital of that",
    "of that population eric let's look at",
    "the next one this is hospital mission by",
    "county type so we break it down into",
    "urban counties",
    "suburban and small metro and rural",
    "counties",
    "and what we're starting to see here what",
    "we are seeing here is the red",
    "the rule again comprise",
    "more of the total number of coveted",
    "cases coveted missions into hospitals",
    "people with covet who are going into",
    "hospitals and so it's just",
    "these are just interesting trends more",
    "rural",
    "we're seeing it more rural and we're",
    "seeing it older",
    "and now let's look uh another way of",
    "looking at this is percentage of",
    "hospital emissions by region",
    "and again these are the regions you can",
    "you'll be able to pull this",
    "down and you can just kind of",
    "make your own conclusions here but the",
    "green",
    "uh the green which is region one",
    "uh north northwest ohio",
    "um and so we're starting to see that uh",
    "we're seeing relatively fewer residents",
    "of the cleveland columbus area",
    "being admitted with code at the same",
    "time are three western regions",
    "one three and six",
    "one three and six as you see them uh",
    "there are seeing a greater percentage of",
    "hospital missions",
    "along with some increases in region 7",
    "and 8 which is southeast ohio",
    "i will make it clear all of our regions",
    "have adequate",
    "capacity remaining in the hospitals",
    "we're certainly keeping a close eye on",
    "it but",
    "but we are okay but it is it is a",
    "geographical",
    "switch and we're seeing an age switch",
    "um let me talk for a moment about",
    "something that's uh",
    "i've heard from a number of",
    "superintendents",
    "and health directors and very very",
    "concerned",
    "um we and let me just say again",
    "um very impressed with what our teachers",
    "are doing",
    "what our principals are doing what our",
    "superintendents are doing they're doing",
    "an absolutely",
    "uh phenomenal job",
    "trying to get as many of the kids back",
    "in school",
    "as they can we've heard from many",
    "superintendents",
    "though about the number of students who",
    "are meeting",
    "the centers for disease control and",
    "prevention's definition of close contact",
    "and are being put into quarantine um",
    "in most cases um you know this is again",
    "this is",
    "this is guidance from the cdc so you",
    "might have",
    "a young person who is in class let's say",
    "a high school student",
    "it's determined that they have coveted",
    "then they go back and determine who they",
    "were seated within",
    "you know a close distance within six",
    "feet uh",
    "and then the cdc guidelines talks about",
    "those individuals being",
    "quarantined",
    "the cdc and i'll just quote part of it",
    "uh",
    "in the context of coven 19 the",
    "definition of a close contact is someone",
    "who is within six feet of a person",
    "diagnosed with coca-19 for a total of 15",
    "minutes or more",
    "um i'll just go down a little bit the",
    "determination of close contact should be",
    "made",
    "this is what the cdc says irrespective",
    "of whether the person with coven 19",
    "or the contact was wearing a mask",
    "and so what people have said to us is",
    "look we're",
    "you know both people were wearing masks",
    "both students were wearing masks",
    "they were within six feet but they were",
    "both wearing masks they were above",
    "15 minutes but they were both wearing",
    "masks and what you know shouldn't that",
    "basically shouldn't that count for",
    "something",
    "so we're looking at this uh frankly",
    "we're our health department and our",
    "health",
    "experts and others who we consult",
    "outside the health department are",
    "very reluctant to change this without",
    "data",
    "so we're going to go out and try to get",
    "some data",
    "and what we're going to do is to take",
    "the new",
    "tests some of the new tests that are",
    "coming in for from the white house",
    "uh that we expect to be here any day uh",
    "we'll ask ohio state uh researchers to",
    "come up with a protocol",
    "uh we're gonna take 10 we think 10",
    "school districts",
    "uh or school buildings in the state and",
    "what we're going to do",
    "is run a test frankly uh of those",
    "individuals who",
    "meet that criteria who would normally",
    "have been quarantined",
    "uh and we're going to follow them with",
    "very frequent",
    "frequent strip test tests these these",
    "strip new strip tests so again well more",
    "details in the future",
    "um this is not the announcement of when",
    "we're going to start it",
    "uh but we're i want to let everyone know",
    "that we are working on this",
    "uh frankly some you know we've seen a",
    "lot of gut-wrenching things and things",
    "that just as",
    "as a parent uh bother me uh you know",
    "kids missing out on school kids missing",
    "out on",
    "activities that they want to be involved",
    "in uh but",
    "frankly you know our medical experts uh",
    "do not feel that we can move off this",
    "without data so what we're gonna look at",
    "to see is okay",
    "let's follow these kids who had this",
    "exposure where both people had mass",
    "they were within six feet of each other",
    "and they were together for more than 15",
    "minutes",
    "uh and we're gonna take some some some",
    "of the some of those",
    "and follow them and just see you know",
    "what they do in fact develop do they in",
    "fact come down",
    "with the covet or or not and what the",
    "percentages are and see if the data",
    "can help inform us as how we move",
    "forward",
    "uh last week i wanted to",
    "we had invited recovery ohio director",
    "alicia nelson",
    "alicia worked with me in the attorney",
    "general's office",
    "she heads up our basically our anti-drug",
    "efforts our recovery efforts",
    "uh in the state and i want to",
    "invite her to join us today",
    "uh to talk about you know some of the",
    "things that that",
    "we are seeing and i know alicia uh",
    "last month uh was recovery ohio month",
    "but",
    "uh for you for the departments um",
    "for every ohio and every month really is",
    "kind of recovery month",
    "um and so tell us a little bit about you",
    "know what you're seeing out there i mean",
    "we we know that um",
    "you know we're seeing uh an increase in",
    "mental health problems we're seeing an",
    "increase",
    "in in in drug use uh drug dependency",
    "and so these are some of the the the",
    "things that have come along with",
    "uh the virus that you know obviously",
    "caused us a great deal of",
    "of concern so alicia i'm going to turn",
    "over to you and kind of tell us",
    "uh maybe what we're doing and what could",
    "be of help",
    "well thank you governor uh first i want",
    "to",
    "echo what you said and thank everyone",
    "who participated last month in national",
    "recovery",
    "month and i'm glad to also be here with",
    "you this week to kick off mental health",
    "awareness week",
    "and talk about what ohio's been working",
    "on to support",
    "those with mental health and substance",
    "use disorders and their families",
    "um as you said uh",
    "we have seen some increases that have",
    "concerned us and what research has",
    "really told us",
    "is that at times of natural disaster or",
    "traumatic events",
    "and in this case in pandemic times it",
    "has proven to be",
    "a time of increased anxiety and stress",
    "for those",
    "across the country and it's been",
    "certainly true in ohio",
    "and what we're seeing is that you know",
    "people who have never had to worry about",
    "mental health or other issues like",
    "stress and anxiety are starting to have",
    "feelings and symptoms of stress and",
    "anxiety",
    "and then those who frequently or",
    "or may struggle with a condition a",
    "mental health condition or substance use",
    "disorder",
    "are seeing their symptoms increase and",
    "so what we have done is wanted to make",
    "sure",
    "that folks knew that our behavioral",
    "health system is",
    "open and we wanted to make sure that",
    "that system remain",
    "open and work to be creative to do uh",
    "that work to to make sure the system",
    "stayed open i guess is what we really",
    "wanted to say",
    "here and one of the ways that we've done",
    "that is through our telehealth system",
    "right now if you have a phone in ohio",
    "you can access",
    "treatment supports in in",
    "really get to talk with someone about",
    "any of the symptoms you're feeling",
    "we also wanted to make sure that",
    "important medication",
    "assisted treatment services through our",
    "opiate treatment programs remained",
    "available",
    "and have really allowed for take-home",
    "dosing",
    "and it really expanded the use of",
    "naloxone as the third",
    "way to make sure that we're looking at",
    "opiate overdose deaths",
    "um and overdoses and really combat those",
    "with any tool that we have in the",
    "toolbox and naloxone is an important",
    "tool for that",
    "so right now if you're in our state you",
    "can access naloxone by mail",
    "through our ohio department of health or",
    "your local department of health's",
    "project down program",
    "along with many other programs across",
    "the state and we felt that that would be",
    "important",
    "as we move forward and continue to",
    "address this crisis",
    "together so",
    "a director in regard to someone",
    "let's say you have someone in your",
    "family uh who",
    "has an addiction problem and you're",
    "concerned that they may have relapsed or",
    "well how do you",
    "how should a person deal with that say",
    "they've got a brother let's say they've",
    "got",
    "a son daughter or somebody and a mother",
    "or somebody in their family",
    "one of the best things that you can do",
    "is is really talk to somebody about what",
    "you're experiencing",
    "and and recognize that the any",
    "differences that you see in your family",
    "members or even in yourself",
    "during these times that you you do have",
    "a support network in the state of ohio",
    "that can help you",
    "and one avenue to get support is the",
    "covic care line that the department of",
    "mental health and addiction",
    "services has set up that tool is",
    "available",
    "seven days a week 24 hours a day",
    "it's a toll-free call-in line you can",
    "call",
    "and talk to somebody about what you're",
    "seeing what you're experiencing what",
    "you're feeling",
    "and they can really help you navigate",
    "through",
    "through that and that number is",
    "1-800-720-9616",

    "that you charge us with governor is to",
    "find out maybe",
    "why some of that that uh great",
    "intellectual property",
    "uh in our colleges and universities was",
    "not being",
    "commercialized why we weren't developing",
    "enough small businesses",
    "as a result of that which we know create",
    "jobs and",
    "help bolster our economy what we found",
    "when we",
    "we looked at that was that it was a",
    "little bureaucratic getting that",
    "intellectual property",
    "out of the university system both from a",
    "standpoint",
    "of contract negotiations and just",
    "speed to market it wasn't it was slow it",
    "was not very entrepreneurial",
    "it was not functioning at the speed of",
    "business so the innovate ohio team",
    "partnered with the ohio department of of",
    "uh educat",
    "ohio department of higher education and",
    "the inner university council who was",
    "who was just instrumental in this uh",
    "looking how we could change it uh to",
    "create less friction save time and money",
    "and move more intellectual property into",
    "the marketplace and that's when",
    "we created the ohio ip promise",
    "the i the ip promise included",
    "14 our 14 public universities and two",
    "privates",
    "case western university and",
    "the university of dayton and the ip",
    "promise",
    "was a uniform transparent way",
    "of taking this intellectual property and",
    "moving it uh",
    "into the marketplace into",
    "commercialization and really to take",
    "these great innovations on our campuses",
    "and helping improve people's lives",
    "and after this one year anniversary i",
    "wanted to give a little report on where",
    "we stand",
    "i had some great conversations with some",
    "of these",
    "universities to talk about their",
    "successes i had a wonderful one last",
    "week with david adams who's",
    "uc's the university of cincinnati's",
    "chief innovation officer",

    "last year university of cincinnati had a",
    "400 percent increase in the number of",
    "startups",
    "that were spun out of uc intellectual",
    "property and this year alone there have",

    "i tech ignite the night pitch",
    "competition that helps",
    "and and their technology helps predict",
    "bone weakness",
    "in a non-invasive manner that's",
    "obviously important for nasa but just",
    "think of the",
    "the geriatric and and other health um",
    "implications that uh that this",
    "potentially has health value that this",
    "has",
    "coming out of that research um i will",
    "also note something that happened at the",
    "university of dayton research institute",
    "uh as a result of the ohio ip promise",
    "and that was",
    "uh the development of this of x-rays to",
    "diagnose covet 19",
    "and they used the principles outlined in",
    "the ohio ip promise",
    "to get that to market in just two and a",

    "for the",
    "ip promise commercialization efforts",
    "first",
    "there will be a statewide",

    "and these will allow more than two",
    "institutions to jointly own an",
    "invention and to work together to",
    "commercialize it",
    "uh these agreements define the",
    "responsibilities for marketing",

    "you know i understand what this is",
    "doing this does hurt small businesses",
    "people who",
    "running restaurants and bars i'm going",

    "days to talk to",
    "a number of representatives from the",
    "restaurant association",
    "we're trying to balance that uh we also",

    "some of our mayors you know one mayor",
    "who's for it but uh we have",
    "most of the other mayors that are",
    "talking to us are saying you know they",
    "do not want to see that done",
    "and so we're trying to balance you know",
    "the",
    "that whole issue of safety at the same",
    "time",
    "you know protecting our small businesses",
    "both of these things are important and",
    "so",
    "you know that's what we're trying that's",
    "what we're trying to uh",
    "to balance as far as the bengals and the",
    "browns",
    "uh we started by uh first games",
    "uh at 6 000 people um",
    "i don't know the exact capacity but you",
    "know we're over 50 000",
    "uh i think in both both uh",
    "places and uh we kind of looked at that",
    "we talked to the",
    "local health departments we talked to",
    "local officials",
    "uh to see what impact that had uh it",
    "looked like uh",
    "it was it was safe uh they really didn't",
    "have any incidents",
    "um so thought we could take it up to 12.",
    "this would give more football fans uh in",
    "ohio",
    "uh the opportunity to go but also do it",
    "in",
    "in a safe way uh and i think we're",
    "probably at where we're gonna stop",
    "uh and i made it very clear to the",
    "ownership of the browns and the bengals",
    "that",
    "you know this is a",
    "game by game but we don't see any reason",
    "that it couldn't continue at at twelve",
    "thousand",
    "uh people that would seem to be a",
    "reasonable thing",
    "uh we have our overall guidelines um we",
    "look at each case",
    "uh just as we did with with high school",
    "football we had variances and",
    "we gave some variances there so we're",
    "trying to provide the broad guidelines",
    "in the big",
    "uh big events you know again we try to",

    "and you've been exposed you should still",
    "quarantine for for 14 days",
    "so i was hoping to talk a little bit",
    "more about why you think",
    "an ohio-based school study would show",
    "something different than what the the",
    "various cdc studies have shown is this",
    "just a",
    "um just just appease the school",
    "officials",
    "no um look",
    "we don't want to move away from cdc",
    "unless there's some data that shows that",
    "we",
    "are safe and moving away from cdc",
    "you know getting a study in ohio schools",
    "that is spread out among different",
    "demographics",
    "will provide us with more information it",
    "does not mean there'll be a decision",
    "to move uh doesn't mean anything it",
    "simply means we're trying to get some",
    "additional",
    "additional information uh we are looking",
    "at how to use these tests",
    "as you know ohio",
    "will be receiving about 128",
    "000 of these tests we believe every",
    "seven to ten days",
    "uh and we we continue to work on how",
    "we're going to deploy them to save lives",
    "how we're going to deploy them to allow",
    "ohioans to",
    "uh to do more things and try to do more",
    "things safely",
    "so this would come into the second",
    "category but",
    "we're going to see what the test what",
    "what we come up with and",
    "we're going to go with the facts next",
    "question",
    "is from sean lanier at wcmh in columbus",
    "governor dewine as you may know the uh",
    "columbus city council just repealed",
    "their",
    "curfew their 10 pm curfew understanding",
    "that the",
    "statewide last call order is in place i",
    "know you just touched on it a little bit",
    "but is there any type of timeline that",
    "you're looking at",
    "to to make an announcement is there any",
    "any indicators",
    "that you're looking at or or a",
    "specialist that are talking to you about",
    "uh when this could possibly change i",
    "understand that you're trying to balance",
    "the safety but also the sustainability",
    "of these",
    "bars and restaurants that are hurting",
    "because of this order",
    "sure mayor genthan and i talk at least",
    "twice a week usually",
    "four or five times a week and you know",
    "he he knows that we're looking at this",
    "he's very aware of the fact that we are",
    "we are looking at this",
    "um you know he's expressed his opinion",
    "that uh he hopes we don't change it",
    "uh we have mayor cranley uh in",
    "cincinnati who",
    "wants us to change it uh so we you know",
    "we take all the information",
    "and we try to balance these these things",
    "um",
    "want to keep our economy going want to",
    "protect our small business but at the",
    "same time",
    "um you know we're watching the numbers",
    "uh watching what's happening and trying",
    "to you know keep ohio from",
    "spiking up uh flaring flaring up so",
    "it's it's no different than many of the",
    "other decisions we make frankly uh",
    "there's no there's no easy answer and",
    "there's no no perfect answer",
    "and there's usually a two answers that",
    "uh",
    "neither one are perfect and you know",
    "both are kind of in one sense once",
    "try to figure out which is the worst",
    "alternative so we're looking at these",
    "things and we're trying to",
    "trying to weigh this out next question",
    "is from andrew welsh huggins at the",
    "associated press",
    "happy birthday andrew i hear it might be",
    "your birthday today",
    "hi governor it is thank you very much i",
    "really appreciate that",
    "um i just had two quick questions uh",
    "following up on the small business uh",
    "renter mortgage aid package that you're",
    "working on that you mentioned earlier",
    "um so in terms of making the money",
    "available",
    "quickly how seriously are you looking at",
    "an option like",
    "the controlling board as the fastest",
    "method to deliver the aid",
    "and then longer term especially with",
    "last week's report that initial",
    "unemployment claims ticked back up what",
    "are your concerns that small businesses",
    "and low-income renters are going to",
    "need even more help down the road than",
    "what this package can deliver",
    "well they certainly may need more that",
    "we can deliver",
    "with this package as far as using the",
    "controlling board",
    "of course that is a creature of the",
    "state legislature",
    "you know there's two ways to get money",
    "out you can we can pass a bill",
    "or we can you know go through the",
    "controlling board in either case",
    "you know we need um the support of the",
    "legislature",
    "uh so this is a dual project and uh you",
    "know i feel good though i think that",
    "we're",
    "coming close to having this thing worked",
    "out about what we can do now",
    "uh and because we want to get some of",
    "this money out but",
    "i i think you're right i mean we could",
    "be",
    "you know we don't know how long we're",
    "going to see a downturn in the economy i",
    "mean we",
    "we're we're battling back we're doing",
    "things but",
    "we still have a lot of people hurting",
    "and we need to you know we need to be",
    "able to give them some relief",
    "uh you know part of this a mental health",
    "issue if you're sitting there and you",
    "got you know number of months of rent",
    "back and uh you know you're worried",
    "about your family",
    "uh you're worried about where is that",
    "money going to come from am i going to",
    "get evicted from my house am i going to",
    "get evicted from my apartment",
    "you know none of that's good none of",
    "that is good",
    "and so we want to provide some relief",
    "there",
    "that money will go out also and and",
    "you know will spread throughout the",
    "economy uh very quickly",
    "uh it will help the landlord who owns it",
    "might have a mortgage to pay too",
    "and so it will have a big big impact i",
    "think as we as we put this money out",
    "and you know what we balance as we look",
    "at this",
    "is to make sure that we have um",
    "sufficient money for the testing that",
    "we're going to need",
    "we also have a big question mark out",
    "there and that's what congress is going",
    "to do",
    "and whether or not congress is going to",
    "you know allow us to carry this money",
    "over until next year",
    "uh is the congress going to pass a",
    "separate bill where they provide",
    "additional funds to do different things",
    "and so we're",
    "we're kind of we're waiting but we can't",
    "wait and",
    "this is something that we think that we",
    "can set this money aside we can push",
    "this money out we can help people now at",
    "the same time we'll still have money",
    "back you know in regard to the testing",
    "and the other things that we absolutely",
    "have to have the money to be able to do",
    "to fight this virus",
    "thank you next question is from mike",
    "livingston at gangwar news service",
    "hi governor uh regarding your strong",
    "ohio",

    "uh we're gonna we're gonna stay on this",
    "and uh we look forward to a you know",
    "lame duck session where we can",
    "we can do some of these things",
    "next question is from jeff redick at",
    "wsyx in columbus",
    "good afternoon governor you touched on",
    "the president's remarks",
    "much has been made of the fact that he",
    "said we shouldn't be afraid of the virus",
    "and how his condition improved",
    "he also received an experimental",
    "cocktail of drugs not widely available",
    "and i'm just curious what your efforts",
    "or the health department's efforts are",
    "to",
    "improve treatments in ohio such that",
    "they might be more in line",
    "with the great care the president",
    "received at some point in the future",
    "well i think we all want the president",
    "to have the best care that was",
    "possible uh we would want that for our",
    "president",
    "as far as",
    "getting drugs getting care",
    "to people who have coveted uh this is an",
    "area frankly",
    "uh where i think we've seen some",
    "significant",
    "increase in in the ability to care for",
    "patients",
    "um still have people dying we saw people",
    "going to the hospital",
    "but uh there are more tools available",
    "today there's more knowledge available",
    "in regard to",
    "to the doctors this is an area where i",
    "take no credit",
    "this is what doctors have done this is",
    "what the medical community has done",
    "this is what the researchers have done",
    "so when we're talking about",
    "getting drugs more drugs to individuals",
    "more therapeutic",
    "more ability to deal with people you",
    "know how you treat someone",
    "covert that's out that's out of my",
    "league i take no credit for it but we",
    "are going up and we're moving",
    "in the right direction not just in ohio",
    "but as a country",
    "we have some of the world's most premier",
    "medical institutions uh in the state of",
    "ohio",
    "and some of the most amazing doctors and",
    "researchers",
    "so we are contributing uh in ohio",
    "not me but we're contributing to to the",
    "knowledge base that exists around this",
    "uh this very very dangerous virus",
    "and that will continue and we'll",
    "continue to move move forward on that",
    "governor if i could if i could add um",
    "one thing",
    "well as the governor stated you know",
    "we're not we're not the doctors but what",
    "we do is we do respond when ohio's",
    "doctors ask us to",
    "when they've needed contacts with the",
    "fda",
    "to help speed up the process for",
    "convalescent plasma treatments and other",
    "things",
    "that they've asked us to do we've",
    "engaged with our medical community",
    "to provide the support and the help that",
    "we can to help them",
    "do what they think is best so we've been",
    "we've been taking our cues from",
    "the medical leaders and we have great",
    "hospitals and institutions in this state",
    "and",
    "we have responded uh by reaching out to",
    "to try to get those clearances for those",
    "experimental treatments as as quickly as",
    "we can to serve the people of ohio",
    "next question is from alex ebert at",
    "bloomberg",
    "good afternoon governor thanks for this",
    "opportunity hey",
    "on sunday in an interview you said that",
    "president trump's administration",
    "was not helping state officials with",
    "contract tracing after",
    "the cleveland debate last week can you",
    "clarify if that is still the case",
    "and if they are helping what are they",
    "doing to do contact tracing",
    "following the debate thank you yeah i",
    "think",
    "i think what i said or what i meant to",
    "say uh was i was not aware of that going",
    "on uh on on two occasions i have talked",
    "uh",
    "to the ceo of the cleveland clinic about",
    "this",
    "issue um you know what he told me",
    "is you know in the room itself um",
    "you know everyone had tested negative uh",
    "they had people spaced out i was not in",
    "the room",
    "but he felt that the only person uh you",
    "know that would need necessarily to be",
    "contact traced probably",
    "uh would it would have been um mr",
    "wallace",
    "uh and of course we saw that he he got a",
    "test later",
    "so you know as far as contract contact",
    "excuse me contact tracing within that",
    "room",
    "i don't know that there was anything uh",
    "you know that",
    "should have been done but again",
    "cleveland clinic is",
    "is there they're the ones who would have",
    "been in contact with the local health",
    "department",
    "if something was was going to happen as",
    "a direct result of that",
    "that movement to the president coming in",
    "and the president leaving",
    "so and that's that's really the you know",
    "the extent of my",
    "my knowledge of it next question is from",
    "carl hunnell",
    "at richlandsource.com",
    "oh sorry good afternoon governor",
    "uh richland county on thursday may",
    "become the state's first",
    "level four county under the public",
    "health advisory system",
    "and that's based at least in part on",
    "outbreaks in the two state prisons here",
    "what exactly does this designation mean",
    "in terms of restrictions for residents",
    "schools and businesses in this county",
    "and is it fair to local residents to",
    "have the purple designation be made",
    "when one of the drivers is the two state",
    "prisons here thank you",
    "yeah for some of the things that we look",
    "at carl",
    "uh the prison is removed from there and",
    "uh i i'm gonna let our statisticians",
    "our data people get that information to",
    "you and to everyone",
    "exactly what the prison",
    "outbreak which there certainly is one",
    "what it impacts and what it does not in",
    "answer to your question",
    "these color codes are really to inform",
    "people",
    "of the nature of a um problem",
    "so you know you start at the yellow you",
    "go the orange and then",
    "into the red uh and then of course there",
    "would be",
    "potentially the purple there but",
    "if they would go purple if they would go",
    "purple um",
    "again it means nothing as far as",
    "what the state is telling them to do",
    "uh it's again red is the indicator",
    "that people should say okay look we we",
    "got a problem here what's what's going",
    "on and let's look at the",
    "data and let's you know is our mask",
    "wearing high enough",
    "uh etc there's no punitive action by the",
    "state of ohio",
    "and yes you know we fully realize there",
    "is a prison there",
    "and and citizens of the community are",
    "not responsible for what",
    "that goes on in the prison",
    "the fact is however that people who live",
    "in richland county work in the prison as",
    "do people i'm sure from many counties",
    "around",
    "and so you know it does have an impact",
    "um you know on what's going on in in",
    "in the community and the color would",
    "might",
    "you know reflect that uh but we'll get",
    "you",
    "a break out of the indicators and which",
    "indicators you know has anything to do",
    "with",
    "with with the prison but uh you know",
    "again",
    "i think people should be alert now",
    "uh that we do have significant spread in",
    "the county",
    "plus we have in other indicators of use",
    "uh of medical whether it's an emergency",
    "room",
    "whether it's in a doctor's office you",
    "know those indicators going off",
    "which says hey we got a we have a",
    "problem but we also have",
    "these are early indicators that there's",
    "there's more of a problem could be more",
    "of a problem down the road",
    "that's all we're trying to do you know",
    "the map i put up",
    "a few minutes ago at the beginning where",
    "we put the high incidence counties",
    "and we put the counties with the",
    "different colors those are just",
    "trying to alert people hey this is",
    "what's going on",
    "in you know in your community and we",
    "think uh",
    "because you know we want to be",
    "transparent we want to give people the",
    "best information",
    "we can but we'll have some more for you",
    "next question is from ben schwartz at",
    "wcpo",
    "in cincinnati hey ben governor",
    "um do you think that president trump's",
    "reaction to his positive covid test",
    "is endangering ohioans at all",
    "specifically",
    "about his and his administration's",
    "willingness to take off their masks",
    "while around others and the example",
    "they're setting while the state is still",
    "encouraging ohioans to wear masks while",
    "possible",
    "yeah ben i mean i i talked earlier about",
    "what i think we should take away from",
    "this and one of the things that we",
    "should take away from this",
    "is that um frequent testing",
    "which we can assume everybody had",
    "um is important but it does not",
    "substitute for wearing a mask because",
    "it's not substitute for keeping me",
    "a distance um and look",
    "i've made no uh secret of this",
    "you know i wish the president would wear",
    "the mask",
    "more i wish he'd wear it all the time",
    "when he was in public uh",
    "and i said that before you know he had",
    "the coronavirus",
    "so you know but what i try to distill",
    "down",
    "uh for the people 11.7 million people i",
    "represent in ohio",
    "uh is what can we take away from this uh",
    "what lessons",
    "that are lessons that we can focus on",
    "uh you know we're not we're not the",
    "president uh",
    "we're not gonna fly in a helicopter",
    "probably you know unless there's",
    "some emergency and their flight comes",
    "and gets us but",
    "for the average person what do we take",
    "away from this what do all of us in ohio",
    "take away from that and i think",
    "the lesson about the testing that",
    "testing is very important",
    "but it's not a substitute for the mass",
    "not a substitute for the distance not a",
    "substitute for for those other things",
    "um and we just should have a i think a",
    "renewed sense",
    "that we can live with this but we got to",
    "be tough we got to be strong",
    "and uh we've got to be resilient and and",
    "part of that is wearing a mask",
    "um so there's there's some lessons from",
    "what what happened with with the",
    "president and we should learn from some",
    "of these things",
    "next question is from laura hancock at",
    "cleveland.com",
    "good afternoon governor hello hi i'm",
    "circling back",
    "to the cleveland browns spectator",
    "decision",
    "the owners and upper management of at",
    "the browns had requested",
    "you guys increase it from a range",
    "between around 11 000",
    "to around 16 000 spectators",
    "what was the science that made you guys",
    "settle at 12",
    "000 and like what's the science that has",
    "you can",
    "um concluding that the cap this season",
    "needs to be around 12 000 spectators",
    "i'm sorry i missed the last sentence",
    "give me the last sentence again",
    "um what is the science that has you guys",
    "um concluding that you need to cap the",
    "spectators",
    "at 12 000 this season",
    "yeah part of this is an art part of this",
    "is an art as well as a science but we",
    "you know we try to go by the science and",
    "the sciences is pretty basic um the",
    "science is outside is generally",
    "better than inside not always as",
    "certainly as we found out in in the in",
    "the rose garden doesn't guarantee you're",
    "going to be safe",
    "but it's better than certainly being",
    "being inside",
    "um distance is important and",
    "you know the ability to wear a mask um",
    "and the team requiring and the people",
    "who",
    "run the game run the stadium requiring",
    "people to keep their mask on",
    "you know these were all things that were",
    "important and so what we wanted to do",
    "with both the browns and bengals is",
    "start with 6",
    "000. you know as you saw for if you",
    "watched",
    "any of these games on tv uh it's they're",
    "pretty spread out",
    "uh it's 6 000. and we want to try that",
    "and see okay how's that going to work",
    "how's the flow into the game",
    "going to work how's it used to restrooms",
    "going to work",
    "and the health departments of both those",
    "cities were were there",
    "and were able to observe that",
    "uh the mayors and their health",
    "departments you know we were able to",
    "contact them so we started with six",
    "thousand it just",
    "you know we felt fairly safe with that",
    "um",
    "and we figured that doubling that uh",
    "spreading it out",
    "all over the stadium would still allow",
    "enough room",
    "uh could it could have been 13 000 could",
    "have been 11 000",
    "yeah it's uh you know we kind of looked",
    "at what we had at 6 000",
    "felt very comfortable with that feel",
    "comfortable at doubling it",
    "um you know that's probably about as far",
    "as where",
    "we're going to go uh you know again we",
    "have an obligation to",
    "provide a safe environment for people",
    "who go in there they're going to be",
    "there a long time",
    "these games last three hours sometimes a",
    "little longer",
    "so people get there half an hour before",
    "the game they're going to be there maybe",
    "up to close to four hours",
    "so it's a long time to be in your seat",
    "and so the proximity is certainly there",
    "so you want to keep people spread out",
    "but there's no you know there's no magic",
    "about 12 it just seemed to be",
    "the right the right place to come out",
    "knowing and following",
    "the basic health guidelines that we've",
    "been hearing and talking about",
    "next question is from jim oddy at",
    "w-h-i-o",
    "in dayton hey jim hey governor",
    "um given the fact that the president now",
    "says don't fear the coveton yours now",
    "saying",
    "well continue with caution uh i'm",

    "our health advisors not just in the",
    "health department",
    "but but our main doctors around the",
    "state",
    "uh are very reluctant frankly to change",
    "that guidance",
    "uh unless there's some data that",
    "indicates that",
    "you know that spread with two people",
    "having a mask on three feet apart or",
    "four feet or five feet or whatever it is",
    "uh that the incidence of spread is very",
    "very very low",
    "and if it's not very low uh or you know",

    "lessen those is there a way",
    "that we can get real data look at it in",
    "ohio",
    "from a representative sample of students",
    "students who have been exposed",
    "within that six feet over 15 minutes",
    "and track them and have them take three",
    "tests a week or whatever the the experts",

    "right",
    "thing to do we thought we still do uh",
    "same way as sports we said let them go",
