this morning is 2019-1498
rayco manufacturing incorporated versus
murphy roger slosh and gamble
a professional law corporation at all
for the appellant we have mr lykans
chief justice o'connor you may have
pleased the court my name is andrew
lykins
i represent the appellant raycom
manufacturing inc i like to reserve
three minutes for rebuttal
the pellis in this case filed a motion
to enforce an alleged settlement
agreement
the party stipulated to emails and
messages exchanged
by council regarding the settlement but
the trial court still believed that the
fact
about issue of fact existed as to
whether a contract was formed
and then paneled an advisory jury to
determine that issue and the advisory
jury deliberated for approximately four
hours before determining a contract was
even formed
reiko actually prevailed on the factual
issue raised in the motion to enforce
namely the jury found that a january 26
2017 letter was not an
offer of settlement however the jury
accepted an alternative theory
advanced towards the end of trial
regarding a
february 23 2017 email also being able
to
be considered an offer because the
motion asked only for a hearing on
whether a contract was formed
that was the only issue decided the
trial court did not find that the
contract was breached and there was no
evidence presented that
the apellis had performed or been
damaged the trial court refused to award
fees because it determined that the
american rule applied and then no
exception to that rule had been
established
in doing so it specifically held that
there was insufficient evidence of bad
faith
without finding that the trial court had
abused its discretion the
district nevertheless reversed the
decision not to award fees
in doing so it mischaracterized the
lower court's finding as a determination
that the contract had been breached
and also contended that labeling
attorneys fees as damages took the case
outside of the american rule
the district awarded fees even though
none of the other exceptions applied
thus implicitly conceding that it was
really creating a new exception to the
american rule
and at the same time conceding that
insufficient evidence had been
a bad faith had been established to
trigger the existing exception
adopting the eighth district's decision
would open a pandora's box of policy
issues
it would allow courts to decide which
public policies should be supported with
a fee award rather than the legislature
and encourages litigation because it
rewards a party for proving even a
technical breach with fees
without imposing consequences for
failing to establish a breach
it allows recovery of compensatory
damages on emotion for reasons not
raised in the pleadings
it allows recovery for breach of
contract even without proving all the
elements of breach of contract
it allows a party to specifically
enforce a contract while also recovering
damages for breach of the same contract
and it overrides freedom of contract by
not honoring the party's decision
whether
to not a loser pays approach this flows
from the 8th district's decision
to adopt the shanker line of cases which
held that attorney's fees may be awarded
in a breach of contract case
if the fees incur were incurred directly
as a result of the breach
schenker was decided 20 years ago and no
other state has recognized the
proposition of law that it adopted
however the u.s court of appeals for the
federal or for the first circuit
has expressly rejected shanker's
approach as inconsistent with the
american role
thus it is not surprising i like council
like actually questioned um did the
appellate court
uh first of all the trial court did not
find bad faith here did they
that is correct your honor they found
that there was insufficient evidence of
bad faith
okay so how did the appellate court deal
with that
concept of bad faith uh it
essentially held that bad faith was not
unnecessary
it was not necessary to be shown because
uh they were going to award visas
damages rather than as
sanctions so it was just merely the
semantics that allowed them to go from
uh you know the the to re-characterize
uh the fees uh that is our position your
honor and i believe that's uh consistent
with this court's precedent
um this court has held in michael's v
morris
in 1956 that litigation cost attorney's
fees constitute
uh litigation costs rather than damages
um in state actual beacon journal it
said morris settles that issue and it
reaffirmed that as recently as christie
beat gms morgan in 2000.
uh likewise the court has also held that
attorney's fees cannot be awarded as
compensatory damages for breach of
contract
uh in gatesby city of toledo california
i'm curious here when i when i look at
this agreement
uh it says that the law firms
will agree to release reiko from quote
all claims for attorneys fees
and related expenses incurred in
connection with the agreement
why didn't you just argue that uh
attorney's fees were borrowed by the
terms of the release
uh well you're honored that's true and
it's also true
that when asked if the agreement
uh provided for a loser pays a fee
shifting provision
the apellis in this case specifically
told the trial judge that this
contract does not provide for fee
shifting um
so not only does that provide for it but
there was no did you argue though below
that
uh that under the under the agreement
they
they agreed that they weren't entitled
to attorney's fees in connection with it
uh that was not specifically argued
below your honor
why not um i believe
the parties were focused on the american
rule that's what the trial court judge
has specifically framed the issue as
uh and since the american role uh
clearly barred the fees that was the
argument made
and um as chief justice o'connor noted
this is largely a semantic issue in the
united states supreme court
um 224 years ago it rejected the same
effort to re-characterize
attorney's fees and damages and arkham
balbi wiseman
the court has also held that new
exceptions to the american rule are
legislative issue and soar and the board
of education
which recognized that whether to shift
fees is a policy decision
and therefore a matter of legislative
concern rather than judicial concern
to quote the court any departure from
such a deeply rooted policy as exclusion
of attorney's visas cost
is a matter of legislative concern and
the subject of cost is one entirely of
statutory allowance and control
his district admitted that there was no
statute that provides for speech
shifting
a settlement contract is breached and
instead relied upon this court's
decision and
be sterling industries which recognized
ohio public policy encourages
settlements
however sworn stands for the principle
that it is up to the legislature
which public policies to support with a
fee award that is consistent with the
united states supreme court precedent on
this issue
including an alias the pipeline which
stated that public policy is not a grant
of roving authority to the courts to
award fees
in fact this court has held that public
policy supports the enforcement of
contracts in general
in bellevue mcconnell however as noted
earlier the court has consistently held
that
courts cannot award attorneys fees for
breach of contract
what the appellants are doing in this
case is trying to apply
a fee shifting provision into every
settlement at contract because the
contract
that they drafted does not provide for
fee shifting
however this court has stated that it
will not read a fee provision into every
settlement contract or just into
contracts the parties did not agree to
and stata auto be we grow which is
consistent with this court's general
line of cases
saying that the court will reap not
rewrite a contract for the parties
further the contention that a party
should be made whole
for breach of contract is inconsistent
with this court's precedent
this court has long refused to allow a
fee award for breach of contract
and as former justice cook acknowledged
in brandenburg the american rule often
means the party will not be made whole
as the u.s supreme court has stated it
has expressly rejected
the argument as to the american rule in
norfolk the
light belt saying that a party can't
court can't award fees to recover to a
recovery to make a party truly whole
under the american rule in fact the
appellates haven't cited a single case
where fees were awarded just to make a
party hole for breach of contract
they instead rely upon cases where one
party sucks or contractually agreed to
pay the fees of another
our court's awarding fees as
compensatory damages for breach of
contract
admitted that is inconsistent with
general contract law
the schenker line of cases has led lower
courts astray by training settlement
contracts is somehow different
in sheets via ajo the fifth district
held that fees can be awarded
if they are incurred directly as a
result of reach a contract and
bad faith is shown the requirement that
a movement show bad faith is consistent
with the american rule
however shanker cited sheets as allowing
fees to be awarded his damages if they
flow directly from the breach
ignoring the bad faith requirement took
this line of cases outside
the american role sheets and shankar
were not limited to breach of settlement
agreement cases she itself involved a
real estate purchase agreement
however 15 years after shankar was
decided the 10th district in tahata
held that shanker was limited to
breaches settlement agreement cases
and an apparent attempt to bring this
line of cases back within the american
rule
however failed to identify any basis for
singling out one type of contract for
special treatment
and the new exception seems to be
created more by accident than an
intentional
uh decision to ignore this court's
president or the reasoning behind it
the eighth district's approach is also
procedurally flawed as it allowed the
appellates to seek breach of contract
damages
by filing a motion emotion is
fundamentally different than a breach of
contract
action emotion fails to invoke the
court's jurisdiction to award damages
and further the breach of contract a
breach of contract requires proving four
elements
that a contract was formed that the
movement performed under the contract
that the opposing party breached and
that the movement suffered damages as a
result
a motion to enforce requires a movement
to prove only the first element
it's the equivalent of a declaratory
judgment action or specific performance
action
the revised code specifically provides
the declaratory judgment actions
uh that these cannot be awarded in those
unless a statute provides otherwise
or frivolous conduct is demonstrated in
the end the eighth district allowed a
breach of contract damages without the
appellates
showing all the elements of breach this
rises a second procedural problem with
the eighth district's decision
namely reiko demanded a jury trial in
the case for any issues so triable
the breach of contract and the amount of
any resulting damages are both jury
issues in christmas mortgage this court
held that if attorneys fees are damages
they must be determined by the jury or
the eighth district
treated the uh cases resolving the issue
of liability and remanded for a damages
hearing only
reiko is entitled to a jury trial on
both the issue of breach of contract and
damages
however if the hearing on the trial uh
the hearing was the trial on breach of
contract then damages was a necessary
element of proof
in that trial employees however did not
present india
proof of their damages or that they had
complied with the contract
the apellis didn't inform the trial
court that they were seeking
compensatory damages until after that
trial
that's too late to prove breach it's too
late to preserve rico's right to a jury
trial
and in fact draco would never get a jury
trial on the issue of breach because
pele's that under the eighth district
decision because they remanded only for
a determination as to damages the only
reason to create a new exception
in this case would be if existing uh
exceptions were inadequate
as this court held in sworn that's
really a legislative decision
however even if it were up to the courts
many of the cases where courts award
fees as damages actually include
evidence of bad faith
this fees could be awarded in those
cases without creating
a new exception for going against this
court's existing precedent
the remaining cases are those like
tahada where a party was rewarded for
proving a technical breach
despite the fact that the claim for
damages other than attorneys fees would
be meritless
or cases like this where there was a
legitimate issue as to whether a
settlement contract was even formed
the eighth district used fees a fee
award to punish reiko for
filing a for seeking a ruling unto as to
whether or not
there was a contract was formed our fees
can't be awarded just because a party
insists on uh
the term disputed issue we determined
ultimately the eighth district's
decision undermines public policy
that it reports to promote because if
parties parties are less likely to
discuss settlement if settlement
is disputable always lead to a fee award
like to reserve any remaining time for
rebuttal
thank you thank you council
thank you your honor my name is ernie
fargo with the law firm baker hostetler
we represent the lawyers and law firm of
murphy rogers
with me is mr tim brick of the law firm
gallagher sharp
mr brick represents the lawyers and law
firm
of kavitch familo by agreement with mr
brick
i will present the argument for on
behalf of all apples
mr brick is available however to the
extent there are any questions unique to
his client
may it please the court this is a
question of whether parties to a
settlement contract
are entitled to their expectancy
interest or
benefit of the bargain they expressly
negotiated for
appellants seek to deny the law firms
the benefit of their bargain
one of the core benefits of this
settlement contract
was to eliminate legal fees the whereas
clause in the contract
made that clear of course another core
benefit was to manage the risk of the
litigation
but justice central was the benefit of
stopping legal fees
or to buy peace as the appellate court
described it
and when a party breaches that contract
and forces
additional legal fees to be spent the
non-breaching party has lost the
expectancy of that contract
or the benefit of that bargain council
why is um not the bad faith exception
that exists to the american rule
sufficient to protect these types of
issues
i would imagine that most motions to
enforce settlement
would not involve the protracted
litigation that this particular
case did an advisory jury uh
and such it would probably amount to
just a filing of a motion and
perhaps a short hearing to determine
whether there was a
contract or not and bad faith existed
why is that not sufficient
because the very benefit of the bargain
was the avoidance of legal fees to
impose a burden
on the contracting parties to prove bad
faith
simply to be entitled to its expectancy
interest
or benefit of the bargain would be
inconsistent with how we treat
every other contract in a settlement
contract
the essence of the agreement is
so the party does not have to pay legal
fees anymore
it is a matter of contract law not a
matter of good faith or bad faith
the party breached the agreement here
and deprived
the law firms of the benefit of that
bargain
speaking of speaking of the bargain what
about uh the language i ask opposing
counsel about where it says
that uh the law firms agree to release
reiko
from all claims for attorney's fees and
related expenses incurred in connection
with this agreement that seems pretty
broad
yes uh thank you for that question the
both parties mutually released each
other from all liabilities
claims including attorney fees incurred
in the underlying
litigation in the underlying legal
malpractice
in connection with this agreement that's
that's the language of
the settlement agreement
certainly the the intent and that's why
that is why appellants did not argue
this below it was not a focus on the
american rule
it was not argued because the parties
intended
by their wording to release all claims
including attorney fees relating to the
legal malpractice
claim below certainly nobody
contemplated
that if either side breached this
settlement agreement
that this would be this language would
be used
to release a claim for attorney fees
appellants your honor took the position
that there was no settlement contract
there was no settlement contract and
therefore there was no release language
in there
only when we proved there was a
settlement contract
where are we then allowed our expectancy
interest
or the benefit of the bargain and that
is the legal fees incurred
to enforce that contract that release
what i don't i guess leaving aside
that language for a second uh back to
the main thrust of your argument
i'm having a hard time understanding how
damages here are different than in any
other contract
where i mean to make someone whole
you're if you really want to make
someone whole you'd have to compensate
them
for the legal fees that
they encourage to get the benefit of the
bargain
why is this any different there this is
very distinguishable
from uh other contracts for example
in a contract for the sale of goods in a
contract for goods
the core benefit of that bargain is the
delivery of the goods
at the agreed to price later legal fees
spent
to enforce the
the contract in the event of a breach
are incidental to the core benefit
of the delivery of those goods at the
agreed price
any expenditure of legal fees on a
breach of contract claim
later are incidental to that core
benefit
and that is why so many appellate courts
who have looked at this
have made the distinct the distinction
where the spend of legal fees is
incidental to the contract
so what what's the line here i mean you
know
all the time people enter into
agreements
because they would like to avoid
litigation
uh is is it anytime there's a there's an
agreement where litigation is a
possibility
does it have to be after litigation has
been commenced
it's not simply where it's a possibility
again
when parties contract uh
for the purchase of goods or
the purchase of our project all kinds of
other contracts where there may not be a
lawsuit filed but
one of the there may be this i mean i
may uh
uh i may sell i may
sell my house there may be a defect
defect that's not disclosed
uh i may settle with with the buyer
because
i don't i don't want to get sued uh
am i entitled to attorney attorney fees
appropriate in that case in that case
in that there was a breach of that
agreement in that case
the parties are negotiating to eliminate
the risk
of liability for the sale of that house
they are negotiating to eliminate the
risk of litigation
and part of the thinking for any party
so
so so do you get attorneys feature for
each of that or not well
yes or no yes yes your honor because
part of the benefit of that bargain is i
don't want to go into court
i don't want to have to but it is isn't
isn't that part of the benefit of all
kinds of bargains out there
i mean it could be the incidental
benefit
of the contract for the sale of goods i
mean if i'm
if i'm in a motor vehicle accident and i
settle
i sell that claim presumably one of the
reasons i
settle is because i don't want to be
sued that's exactly right and in that
case
as the insured for instance in that case
we have many settlements
in ohio involving involving accident
cases of course
and the insured will use insurance
proceeds
to pay the uh
the other side the non-negligent party
and that non-negligent party says in
that contract listen
if you pay me consideration if you pay
me your insurance proceeds
i will stop my lawsuit or i will not
bring my lawsuit
and you will not have to pay legal fees
so so is the rule any time
in agreements includes
includes a release of a potential claim
that you're entitled to attorney's fees
the american rule doesn't apply
any time the benefit of the bargain
is is the avoidance of legal fees
so we're talking so we're talking about
a really really broad extension
this isn't just this isn't just about
litigation going on in court this is
about
anytime there could be litigation um if
parties pre-suit settle a tort case
they want to stay out of court that's
expressly the benefit of their bargain
and they should be entitled
so so that that means pretty much any
time when there's
something that could be a torque anytime
the parties settle anytime the parties
settle a dispute or they manage the risk
of liability and want to pay
or accept compensation to stay out of
court
if they are deprived of the legal fees
that they incur
so what what if one of two businesses
have have a have a good fit have a
dispute they both think that they both
think they're right
one ultimately says you know what it's
cheaper just to settle this so
then you're entitled you're entitled to
attorney's visa in that instance if
there's a breach
absolutely yes because that is the
benefit of that bargain
that the hypothetical presents justice
that party is expressly saying i may not
be liable here
but i don't know
that outlaw in ohio the american rule
our position is consistent with the
american rule
it does not violate it it does not
require an exception
to it the american rule would apply in
the sale of a goods
where let me give you an example
okay an oral contract in ohio you have a
right to breach a contract
as long as you're willing to pay the
damages
okay yes but you sue under the oral
contract
there's no basis to get attorneys fees
that that is correct to the extent the
oral contract
is has a benefit of the bargain where
the payment of legal fees to enforce is
simply
incidental as in the sale of a goods but
if that oral contract
justice if in that oral contract
i say if you pay me compensation
i will take measures so you don't have
to spend legal fees
in court and i breached that oral
agreement
the other side ought to be entitled to
that benefit of the bargain
that's that's the word ought that's i
hear you i'm just saying
what is the current law in ohio is not
the american rule
precluding the recovery of attorneys
fees in those cases
today in the sale of a goods in the sale
of goods it prevents it
but where the parties have an express
benefit of the bargain
it does not prevent it because in this
court's
decisions when an insurance company
breaches a duty to defend
an insured this court has always held
that the insured can sue
the insurance company for breach of that
duty to defend
and recover the legal fees spent
defending itself
and that includes the legal fees spent
in bringing the lawsuit against the
insurance company
and the reason is because that is the
specific
benefit of the bargain that was negate
negotiated for
and if we deprive that party of the
benefit of its bargain
its expectancy interest they are
deprived of contractual damages
there is no contractual reason no basis
in contract
that says a party who has an expectancy
damage
or a benefit of the bargain based on
legal fees
should be deprived them simply because
they happen to be legal fees
it is the appellants who are misapplying
the american rule
to deprive a party of its benefit of its
bargain its express
benefit of its bargain its expectancy
interest and this court allows the
recovery
of legal fees in a suit against an
insurance company
for for each of the duty to defend
because it's the expectancy interest
that was negotiated and it was council
if if a party has a colorable defense
that a contractor has even formed in a
settlement agreement shouldn't they be
able to defend that
without the fear that they're going to
incur
legal fees absent bad faith
well individuals or entities
always may have a belief that a contract
uh was not formed and they can lose that
piece of litigation and they still are
bound by that contract in this case
the contract they told us justice
if you enter into this contract if you
promise to pay this amount
you will not have to incur future legal
fees
the police should be entitled to that
expectancy interest
as a matter of pure contract damages
mr vargo if i could ask a question
this can all be avoided in the
settlement agreements can it not
if the parties agree the winner will
you know if this settlement is breached
or argued loser pays the fees
or they can agree otherwise why should
we leave it
open to question like this when within
the american rule you already have a way
that the parties with good lawyers can
protect against that
thank you for that question uh judge
the the the separate fee shifting clause
is unnecessary in this case
because the party sat down and expressly
contracted
so they would not have to pay legal fees
it is an express expectancy interest
in no other contract do we require
parties
to set forth their expectancy interest
before they're entitled to recovery
if a seller fails to deliver goods the
buyer can sue the seller
for the higher price the buyer is forced
to pay elsewhere
less the agreed to price that buyer does
not have to set that expectancy interest
in its contract in order to sue for it
it's able to sue for it under basic
contract law
here the parties expressly contracted
for this expectancy to require
a second to require another fee shifting
clause
is unnecessary in essence this was a
10-page agreement
to shift the fees both parties knew
their they would be liable for the
expectancy interest
suffered by the other party and both
parties knew that expectancy interest
was to stay out of court and to avoid
legal fees
now one argument and
i'll glad to take any other questions
and i know i'm running out of time but
the the other side argues that this will
lead to
claims for immaterial breaches that's
not true
the remand order says that only
reasonable attorney fees will be awarded
so
if somebody brings a motion or
litigation on an immaterial breach
those will not be reasonable thank you
thank you council oh thank you your
honor uh for all those reasons we
respectfully requested the appellate
court be affirmed thank you very much
mr lykins you have about two and a half
minutes left
thank you your honor i'd like to begin
with the uh statement that
mr vargo made that as to what we told
them
i'd like to focus on what they told the
trial court the trial court specifically
asked them did you agree that if a
motion had
to enforce had to be brought that the
loser would pay the other side's
attorney's fees
they responded to that question up to
the trial court with
we did not agree that's on page 409 of
the joint supplement
having told the trial court that this
was not part of the agreement
the argument that is being made that
this was really the benefit of the
bargain and something that the parties
agreed to
is clearly was not an intended part of
the contract if the council agreed
that expressly wouldn't expressly ask
that question that that was not part of
the agreement
as far as the benefit of the bargain
this was a
25 million dollar claim as identified by
the apellis themselves in the
um trial on the underlying litigation
they were able to settle that for three
or three million
um which is approximately 12 of what
potential claim against them was that is
the benefit of the bargain
as the first circuit held when
considering the shanker line of cases
that they're relying upon
you have to look to the contract to
determine what the benefit of the
bargain is
the court uh this courts of this state
have repeatedly held that as well
even in insurance contracts as mr vargo
is referring to
you look to see what it is the insurance
company agreed to do
if there's no agreement to defend in the
insurance contract the courts don't
imply an agreement to defend they've
said we look at it we determine what it
is and then we enforce it
getting your fees for enforcing a
contract
is not part of the benefit of the
bargain unless you specifically agreed
to that
finally i'd like to address one other
issue
in the proceedings below the appellates
filed a motion in lemonade
that stated this is not a trial on the
merits and asked the trial court to bar
any testimony on any issue other than
whether or not a contract had been
formed and what the terms of that
contract were
so the argument that this was really a
determination that the contract was
breached
is something that they expressly stated
below in another motion
was not what that litigation was for
that just emphasizes that there's a
difference between
a motion to enforce and they reach a
contract action
thank you thank you thank you gentlemen
we will take the matter under advisement
you'll be notified of our decision
thank you judge wise for sitting uh
thank you for sitting in
the place of justice stewart
um i wish you a safe trip back to the
fifth district thank you it's always an
honor chief thank you
everyone
my next case this morning is 2019-16
uh the state of ohio versus ryan turner
for the appellant uh first we have
arguing mr ferris
good morning your honor
council you may proceed thank you may i
please the court
chief justice o'connor justices mr
horton my name is zach harris i
represent appellant ryan turner
i'm reserving three minutes for rebuttal
in two minutes for mr grube of the oacdl
who filed in the amicus brief
and who will be addressing the
constitutional arguments from his brief
if necessary
the language of 45 1133 and the
definitions found in 45 1101
dictionary definitions and case law
throughout the state of ohio
all support turner's propositional law
that a murderous who touches but does
not cross the lane line does not violate
section 45 1133
and does not give an officer reasonable
architectural suspicion for a stop
if however the court finds that 45 1133
is ambiguous
the rule of leninity codified in 290104a
requires that the statute be construed
strictly against the state
and liberally in favor of turner which
mandates a finding that touching a line
is not a violation of 45 11 33
a motorist remains in their lane when
they touch the lane line as the
definitions
and 45 1101 for roadway and lane highway
made clear that the lane lines are part
of the lane and can be driven on
the legislature specifically excluded
the berm and the shoulder
from the roadway used for vehicular
travel but did not exclude land lines
since the line can be traveled on it is
the outside edge of the line that marks
the outside edge of the lane
the 12th majority in the state attempt
to establish the inside
edge of the line as the outside edge of
the lane by applying
outside definitions to the phrase
entirely within which is found in 45
11 33 but this position is problematic
for two reasons
first defining within as they do as
on the inside or on the inner side is
actually consistent with turner's
position
a motorist traveling on the lane line is
still driving on the inside
or on the inner side of the outside edge
of the lane line and thus is in the lane
second this is a cherry pick definition
anyways
within is also defined as for one
example not beyond
which certainly suggests that you can
travel on the line but cannot cross
beyond the line
so the statutory definition supports
turner's position the dictionary
definitions support turner's position
other statutes like 45 11 25 and 45 1136
show the legislature's intent to allow
touching
every appellate court outside of the
12th district supports
turner's position even the 12th decision
was a split decision
finally the the amicus and the state
argue reasonable mistake of law
on the basis that the statute is
ambiguous uh thus they are admitting
that 45 1133 does not clearly support
their position
thus i believe that it cannot be said
that the language of 45 1133
clearly and unambiguously supports the
state's position
so that leaves us with two options first
either the statute clearly supports
turner's position which it does
and which is what appellate courts
outside the 12th have unanimously held
or the statute must be deemed ambiguous
and again based on 290104
they must be construed strictly against
the state and liberally in favor of
the accused mr turner and the only way
to do that would be to find that
motorists are allowed to touch the lane
lines
finally concerns about safety from the
12th
and from the state just do not withstand
scrutiny
first appellate courts have expressly
allowed touching lane lines for up to 23
years in various districts throughout
the state of ohio
and there is no evidence that accidents
have increased a review of statewide
crash data does not support these safety
concerns
second these theoretical safety concerns
that are proposed by the 12th and by the
state
falling below deciding to start ramming
their vehicles into
their vehicles yes sir
uh so as i understand it
under your reading the
uh the strips the the lane lines are
are really in both lanes
right i i believe that the
lane line can be touched and the
but answer answer my question i'm just
trying to figure out what lane they're
in
so in your view the painted strip
would be in the center line for example
would be in
both of the lanes right so
motorists in each lane could touch that
lane line that's that's correct
because and because because the entire
strip until they until the outer edge
would be within their lane for both
people so yeah
that's correct you have this kind of no
man's land that's in
in both lanes right correct
and but
if that's the case then how is the
language
that says you you have to drive entirely
within
one lane makes sense because under your
reading if you
if you can go in the paint you're in
both lanes
right so so you're not currently within
one line you're in two-way you'd be in
two lanes
right what i would say is this first
obviously that doesn't apply to the fog
lines in my opinion which is what this
case
but it's to say it's the same definition
for both i mean it's the same
prohibition so we have to we have to
think it means the same thing for
for both the center lanes and the fog
lines so here is what i would say
um think about airline seats so you have
a seat armrest seat and if you put your
arm on the armrest you're not now
occupying two seats
you know an employee of the airline is
not going to rush back and come and
charge you an extra 400
for another ticket because you're now
using two seats but
if your hand drifts across the armrest
all the way across
into the other person's seat now you
have some explaining to do now you have
an issue
so i think that when you read 45 11 33
you have to do it with an understanding
of
the definitions in 45 1101 which as i
laid out in my brief make clear that the
lane lines are part of the lane
part of the roadway usually
how safe is it if you're gonna say the
center line
is uh uh it's permissible
for cars to be driving uh both north and
south
or east and west in
opposite directions and occupy
the center line right so i don't believe
that it creates any safety concerns
first of all like i mentioned this has
been allowed
in districts for at least up to 23 years
in certain districts obviously less than
others based on when the appellate
decisions were made
and we haven't seen any proof of any
increase in crashes and
accident reports does not show that
there's been an increase second the
center lines are already allowed to be
driven on
under uh statute section 45 11-25
and again we haven't seen any issues
with that the legislature could
obviously address that if they thought
that there was
third just because two motorists have
the ability to occupy potentially
the same space doesn't mean that they
can at the same time
if if i am driving on the line and
somebody
another guy counsel who has the
right-of-way in your
example if you're approaching
uh one car approaching another
uh they happen to be just inside
the center line not over it
right um who has the right of way so the
the person who's touching the line if
there is one
there's two cars they're both positioned
on the same
line right so
the end of the motorists wouldn't be
able to just ram into one another
frankly they they still would have the
duty to avoid any types of accidents
just like they do now
and if one did ram their vehicle into
one another and the police decided who
was at fault there there's a number of
criminal and traffic statutes that would
uh
prevent that situation from occurring or
hold a party responsible well how could
you how could you tell which one was
liable if they both had a right to be
there
well they have a right to be there if
nobody else is there
it's sort of the same as if you're
driving one car in front of the other
and then say motorist a is in front
motorist b is behind
motors b technically under the statute
has a right to use the lane that is in
front of him but he doesn't have the
right to
uh you know ram into the back of
motorists and there's assured clear
distance rules there
but right now assured clear distance
under your suggestion
that the center line belongs to both
lanes therefore belongs to both vehicles
uh and um i just don't understand how
you could
uh find fault if so if there's a
collision
well i i would say that the
the same way you would in any other type
of accident
um you would have to decide who was
there
who was allowed to be there and who
moved his vehicle well how do you do
that
that's what i'm asking you how do you do
that under your
uh um you know your scenario
the same way you would determine fault
in any other accident i suppose
you know aob witnesses uh
the people's reports what uh uh
the police officers found through their
investigation i suppose
um but that's already allowed in 45 11
25
again and if we're going to read that
consistent with 45
11 33 then we would have to suggest that
45 11 33 also allows
uh driving on the line
i i don't see that it's as a an issue
that hasn't already been dealt with for
the past 33 years the other concern with
a center line is
typically center lines are double
yellows i suppose the court would be
within their right to
say one motorist can touch one and one
murders can touch the other i don't
think that's the
question presented here so that's not
something that's been delved into
but obviously the court or the
legislature could decide that as well
your honors uh my plan now would be to
hand it over to mr grube if you have any
constitutional related issues but before
i would do that
i would be happy to answer any other
questions that you have about the facts
of the case the record of the case or
anything else contained in our briefs
okay thank you mr group uh how long are
you taking two minutes did i hear
uh yes your honor good morning chief
justice o'connor associate justices
may please the court lewis grube here on
behalf of the
ohio association of criminal defense
lawyers
um we've raised a number of reasons why
this court could simply decline to
answer
the constitutional issue in the first
instance
in our brief we've also provided an
analysis that we think the court
could use in order to determine that the
ohio constitution provides more
protection in this area and that
a reasonable mistake of law does not
render a stop
reasonable if there was no violation of
law
but i think my time is best spent this
morning getting out in front of the
case bowling green v godwin which was
provided by
the ohio attorney general amicus
they make the claim that this is a case
that was already decided by this court
that already opened up the can of worms
for a reasonable mistake of law
and i just i need to get it across that
that was not a mistake of law case that
was simply
a mistake of fact case there was no
question
in that case that it was illegal if you
failed to observe a traffic control
device
that would prime under the bowling green
code the issue in the case was whether
there were six
specific signs in one municipal lot
the question was whether those specific
signs were traffic control devices
there was a statute that required the
city council to actually validate these
these signs
um and more to the point this court
treated it as a mistake of fact case not
a mistake of law case
so uh there was none of the analysis
that you would have expected if you look
at
the high-end case out of the united
states supreme court none of that
sort of analysis was provided by the
court the court uh
determined that prob or explain probable
cause is determined by examining the
historical facts that said paragraph 14
and then determined at paragraph 18
in view of all the facts available to
the officer at the time of the stop
there was probable cause
so i would just simply ask the court not
to treat that as a mistake of law
case and with that i'd conclude i'm
happy to answer any questions
in your honor if there are no questions
i'd like to save the remaining 2 minutes
and 55 seconds for rebuttal
all right
council
is it mr horton going first yes your
honor
okay thank you madam chief justice
justices may please the court my name is
nick horton and i represent the state of
ohio and i will be sharing time
with the attorney general's office uh
your honors this case is about
determining the plain language or giving
meaning to the plain language used by
the general assembly in 45 1133
in particular the phrase entirely within
a single lane
the 12th district determined that the
phrase meant
the vehicle must be driven completely on
the inner side
of the marked lane lines so as not to
touch the mark lane lines
and this court should affirm as such a
decision is uh most closely aligned
with the plain language and the intent
of the statute so there are two ways of
interpreting uh the individual lines
themselves
and that is either as uh part of the
lane
or as sort of a neutral zone or buffer
zone uh
now the the plain language of the
statute and the purpose for the statute
indicate that the lines are the
buffer zones or neutral zones rather
than part of the lanes themselves
so the purpose behind the the lines is
to prevent uh cars from inadvertently
traveling
uh within uh the the path of another
vehicle
or inadvertently traveling on the side
of the road uh
potentially into another vehicle
pedestrian or or
object in other words it
prevents cars from inadvertently trying
to share the same space
so by by construing uh the line as part
of the lane itself
um it would be inconsistent uh to say
that uh it's inconsistent with the
purpose
uh to prevent this inadvertent sharing
of the same space
by saying but cars can share the same
space
on the on the lines themselves council
council
when a lane is being measured the width
of a lane uh is the line
included or not included so there is no
indication
in the omu tcd uh or the
ohio uh roadway design manual um
the the only case that addressed it that
i could find
was the the hatfield case um which
indicated that the the lines were not
part of the lanes
because as the court noted the addition
of the
the end lines or the edge lines and the
center
or the center double yellow lines would
reduce the
the overall width of the lane um
and the language itself indicates that
the the lines cannot be part of the
lanes because if both cars
can touch the center dash line
then by traveling on the center dash
line you are traveling
uh on both the right lane and the left
lane
you cannot possibly be traveling
entirely within a single lane
it counts in this case it's the fog line
okay could you address that
sure so the alliance can't really be
treated any differently for a couple
reasons
first is uh safety it safety is no less
an issue
on the edge line than on the center dash
line
because uh with the center dash line
you're dealing with
moving vehicles and it's it's easier to
for a
moving vehicle to get out of the way of
a car that's encroaching on its
territory um
rather than uh perhaps on the side of
the road where
you may have a broken down vehicle or a
stopped vehicle
or this is uh usually where officers
pull over
uh motorists for a a traffic violation
um and if we don't have enough space on
the side
then you're close to pedestrians and
street signs and telephone poles
uh all of which uh would have a much
tougher time
of getting out of the way of a moving
vehicle encroaching on their
their uh area um and so
i think the safety concerns are even
more prevalent uh on the edge line
so we can't really treat it differently
than
the uh the center line i think this is
supported by the omu tcd as well
because the center dashed lines are
allowed to be crossed whereas
the white edge line is supposed to
discourage all crossing
and it wouldn't make sense to say that a
motorist could not
touch the center dash line the very line
it's allowed to cross
but is not is allowed to touch and ride
on
the uh the edge line which is
discouraged from crossing
additionally there is no differentiation
in 45 11 33 between the
center dash line and the white edge line
and therefore we would be
reading in a differentiation that that
is not necessarily present in the in the
statute except mr horton
i just want to ask this sure the dash
line represents a permissive
condition where cars may pass safely
and a violation of that causing an
accident
may be something else because it's a
permission condition so
that's not really represented here but
when you get
to the omt cd
and you actually read section
3a06 it says that the solid line
discourages or prohibits crossing
it doesn't say the entire entity
inside that line so can you explain this
why why the manual would say
it prohibits or discourages crossing
not on an inside edge sure so um
the the manual actually can't be used to
define what is or is not a marked lanes
violation
because according to the manual uh
crossing the center dash lines
or even crossing that white edge line
would not be a violation
the only violation we would have is if
there was a
a crossing of the solid double yellow
line or solid
double white line in fact when the solid
white line
is used as an edge line
then it only discourages but does not
prohibit
crossing uh so uh so under
that impart knowledge as to what
actually the lane is
isn't that the whole purpose of this
manual
and all of the provisions and the
markings that go into our roadway
isn't that really defining the space
where cars have to stop
or operate within i mean
this manual was created pursuant to
the the federal highway administration
system
and is really across the united states
uniform so that these lines all mean the
same thing whether you're in ohio or
florida or california or texas
so as it's instructive on what a lane is
for all drivers you still don't believe
it has any validity in defining that
not as far as uh defining the
what constitutes part of the lane and
what does not
um so it never
specifically says what uh
what lane markings are part of the lane
and what are not um
and and it can't inform 45 1133
because under the omu tcd crossing those
lines would not be a violation
um it would be i think somewhat similar
to
the situation in in dibbler that this
court handled
um and so the the
most uh appropriate uh use of this line
is to create
is to treat it like a uh a buffer zone
or uh
or a neutral zone uh which would create
the space between the
the uh the vehicles or the vehicle and
whatever is on the
side of the road and that's it's
supported by the omu tcd that the inside
edge of the line
uh is the uh the
the line uh the edge of the uh
individual lane uh and the orc um
so where do i find that then in the omt
cd that the it's the inside edge so
what it indicates is that the white line
may be substituted
for uh for curves or
uh parking and clearly it is the inside
edge
of the curb or inside edge of the the
cars
that delineate the outside edge of the
of the lane therefore it stands to
reason that
if those can substitute for the white
line
it would also be the inside edge of the
white line
that constitutes the outside edge of the
of the line now it could be said that
writing on the line
is uh is within a single lane because
you have not yet breached
into the adjacent area the problem with
that
is that we wouldn't be giving effects to
the word entirely
so uh driving on the line cannot be both
uh driving within the lane and entirely
within the lane
because then we're not giving effect to
the word entirely and we're effectively
reading it out of the statute which we
we cannot do
immediately before the word entirely we
have the words as
nearly as is practicable so how do you
doesn't that
in some way modify the word entirely
no your honor only as a defense as this
court noted in state versus maze
and i think that i think is the issue
with the third district cases that
the defendant brings up is that those
cases focused on practicability and
safety which this court
said uh are not really considerations
when we're talking about uh reasonable
suspicion
um i see my time is getting short and i
want to make sure the
attorney general's office has some time
to address
any issues so we would ask the score to
affirm
uh and if there are no further questions
thank you mr kearney good morning madam
chief justice may please the court
we're here today for two reasons first
to echo
the state that driving on the line is a
violation of the statute
and second to urge that even if it's not
this stop was still reasonable because
the officer made a reasonable mistake
about the law i'd like to quickly
address if i may the lendity point my
friend on the other side raised
the godwin point um and also the manual
point that justice kennedy was asking
about
um as salinity it doesn't apply here
because not only is that the last resort
if you have ambiguity and we think here
the text resolves it about entirely
but also leonidy is about giving the
defendant a break on a conviction
leonidy does not apply when we're
talking here about whether the violation
serves as reasonable suspicion
and in fact that's what segues into the
godwin point
where this court has already said that a
reasonable mistake
does justify a stop as to godwin
um what this court said um was that
the officer on this on the ground or on
the road
trying to enforce law is not like
someone taking a bar
exam so i think that pretty clearly says
they were talking about mistakes of law
they even talked about the officer's
understanding of the law
so calling it a factual case because of
the stop signs
not being valid i don't think works that
and i don't think there's a difference
in reasonableness between a factual
mistake
and a legal mistake um as the heim case
talks about
but again this um this court already
said so in god when
there's no case being made to overrule
it briefly about
the manual and about the
as nearly as practical language if i can
squeeze that into
um one thing the manual does say
in section 3a.05.02
is that it's to delineate quote the
separation of traffic the key word there
i think
is separation and of course as we talked
about with the entirely language
if you have a shared space you're not
separating
if you have a buffer zone where you're
keeping
over here and over here then you are
separating traffic if you're inviting
them to both be on the same space
that's not separating traffic that's
inviting disaster
um further uh to address something my
friend on the other side said
that notion about shared space doesn't
turn on whether someone is
actually going to insist on their rights
and scrape right up against somebody um
no it shows conceptually that it can't
be shared
after all if someone comes three feet
over the line i'm also going to get the
heck out of the way too
if i'm coming the other direction that
doesn't mean they should be there
it just means we all drive defensively
yes when you ask when you make a
statement about
3805 that really talks about the
delineation of
colors and why we use certain colors
on a roadway to demar certain
areas as passable or prohibited
but it's really the functionality isn't
it of the longitudinal line
when you get to three a06
where again it says the general function
and as it relates to the solid white
line
the fog line it discourages or prohibits
the crossing
doesn't that really lead me to the
conclusion that the lane
includes the line and it isn't until you
cross it
know your honor um for a couple of
reasons uh
first in discouraging crossing and this
actually
ties in with um and matches the language
about as soon or as nearly as
practicable
is that there's a difference between
saying look we want to give drivers some
wiggle room to cross
for deliberate safety reasons and the
court talked about this in maze where
they said
look if you need to avoid something you
know whether you need to avoid a live
deer
a dead deer a john deere whatever's in
the road
sure you can cross or if you need to
just make a turn you can do so but
that's when you do so deliberately
what the court in may said is that that
language doesn't allow
you to do so for mere inattentiveness
or carelessness or in this case
drunkenness um
and so that delineation is saying hey
here's where you're be careful
if you need to cross sure look both ways
make sure you can
but the the allowance we give is for
deliberate and if you're moving
deliberately
well then you're not only allowed to
touch you're allowed to outright cross
when it's warranted by the facts but we
don't allow free drifting to just
keep on touching whether once or 100
times just like we don't allow
crossing because again the line has to
be
conceptually between the spaces or
between the allowable spaces not
a shared space where everyone can go
um that's simply the matter of the text
and the precedent and the common sense
so we ask you to uphold this search
council i have one
i have one additional question you know
we're talking about the
legality of this and the language of the
statute and the manual but
the context is somebody is being stopped
because they put a part of a tire
on the fog line i mean how i i
can't i'm concerned about the broader
implications of saying that
that now anybody can be stopped simply
because
they drifted a part of a tire onto a fog
line
what do you what do you make of the
broader implications of this
sure a couple of answers at your honor
first
if what we want so that officers um
use their discretion wisely is that
brightline rules
which we talk about all the time
figuratively in here literally bright
rhyme rules are actually
easier to apply if you're watching
whether it's watching a video
or listening to an officer's testimony
it's easier to say did you touch or not
than have a line of whether you went
over to the other side because frankly
once your tire is halfway over the
stripe
whether you can even see whether you've
crossed to the other side
it's easier to see touching or not the
other thing about that is as the court
below pointed out
that we for simplicity look at tires but
realistically
if you picture not just a stripe but a
plane in space if there were a wall
there
your bumpers and your side view mirrors
are actually several inches over the
line by the time they're touching
um and sometimes uh you know cars do
scrape mirror against mirror happen to
me once it's uh
that's unsafe so touching the line
actually means
in space your car is over lined but the
other thing ultimately
where they suggest that officers might
abuse this power by saying it happened
when it didn't
now i think first not only do i have
more trust in the honesty of our
officers and our dash cams
but the fact that there are so many
appellate court cases
about just touching the lines says
something about the honesty of all the
officers across the state
that they admit openly look he just
touched the line he didn't go over
if you're going to say there was a touch
when there wasn't you might as well just
say
well he went all the way over because
after the fact
as between the officers testimony and
the person we now know was
two and a half times the legal drinking
limit you know let's be honest that
this doesn't appreciably change
how much discretion you have you can
pull someone over for being one mile
over the speed limit
we don't often but it's perfectly legal
to do so we don't get a free five miles
that the court imposes into the law even
if in practice we don't give many
tickets for driving
66 or 67 so there's no real expansion
here if anything
there's a clarification just like with
any area of law
a bright line is easier to see and
easier to apply
than when you're sort of in the middle
of the line or over the line
so this actually serves the purpose of
clarity and doesn't eat away at it
thank you thank you council
uh mr ferris
thank you your honor so there are
several things i'd like to address first
of all the idea of lane lines as buffers
frankly is not found in the orc
not found in the omu tcd it's an idea
that the state
makes up for lack of a better word to
support their finding here
and there's a lot of examples that show
just the opposite including the language
of the omu tcd that was brought up
earlier
which in my opinion makes clear that
you're allowed to touch the line but not
cross it
second if lane lines are buffers then
when we think about the fog line in
particular that would actually serve to
push
traffic back towards the middle which
frankly would be more dangerous
lane lines are not required on one lane
roads but one lane roads
do often have uh lane lines and if
they're not required on one lane roads
and they must
not be required there as buffers so if
they're on the one lane roads they must
be there for some other reason
to provide notice to provide warning for
motorists they're not being used as
buffers there
the park car and curb example provided
by
mr horton frankly cars and curbs are not
replacing
the edge lines there's reasons we can't
touch cars and curbs one they're not
part of the roadway so they'd be
excluded by the definition of 45 1101
uh two you can't just ram your vehicle
into a into a
curb or a car and frankly at flame lines
for buffers we would want lane
lane lines uh in those situations to
keep motorists away
under the state's reasoning from parked
vehicles or from pedestrians on the
sidewalk
but since they're explicitly not used in
those situations it suggests again
that the reason for lane mines is not as
buffers but as something else
and there's other examples in my brief
from the omu gcd showing that lane lines
are not actually buffers
i'd like to address quickly what about
the
point that mr kearney makes that if
you're driving
on the lane line okay the fog
line your car is actually over
the line uh because that's where
your doors and you know the the side of
your car
is uh how do you address that
so that is not something that's ever
been held uh
to to be prohibited by the revised code
by any
case or or court that's ever looked at
this and that's going to create a whole
host of problems
um first of all a lot of problem it's a
problem to acknowledge
that if the tire is riding along
the white line that
the fact is part of the car is over the
line
so if we accept that then we have to say
that when trucks
especially big trucks and trailers it
they their tires wouldn't even be
touching the line
and their mirrors would be over the line
and into the other lane so those trucks
even without touching the line would be
creating a violation
and a lot of these vehicles wouldn't
even be allowed on the road they just
would not fit
plus now we're creating a situation
where police officers and this is
already a difficult situation for them
potentially but they have to imagine an
invisible line down from somebody's
mirror to the ground to decide if
there's been a more plane violation
that's just impractical it frankly be
unfair to drivers and unfair to law
enforcement
and again this will keep many legitimate
motorists off the road we would have to
widen all of the roads if we were going
to take that approach
i do have a few other points that i'd
like to address i see obviously that
over my time if i'm allowed to answer
them i will if not i understand
you've used your time thank you thank
you honor thank you we'll take the
matter under advisement you'll be
notified of our decision
one
our next case is 2019-1700 the state of
ohio versus christian carlisle
for the appellate mr mackin warning
duke justice o'connor fellow justices
deputy solicitor general bryant
may please court my name is justin
mackin with the lake county public
defender's office
now i'd like to reserve three minutes
for rebuttal separation of powers
doctrine
is born from our constitutional
framework with a concern to ensure
integrity and dependence of each branch
in
our orc 2909 15 d2b
which are referred to here on ali the
reduction provision
violates that from that constitutional
framework now broadly speaking the
statute requires the defendant convicted
of an arson defense
to register for a lifetime partisan
registry unless the prosecuting attorney
and investigating agency
allows the judge to consider the
sentencing of a period
not less than 10 years that provision
violates the separation of powers in two
ways
a counselor counselor what do you mean
by the word allow
well in our position that the
judge cannot consider anything other
than a mandatory registration
unless the investigating agency and the
prosecutor
says we are allowing you or we say we
are okay
with saying that you can consider this
reduction it's
it's a it's a request right by
investigating
um the arson investigator and the
prosecutor
yes but if in the if at least how the
uh this provision is written if either
the prosecuting attorney says
does not request it or the investigating
agency doesn't request it
then the judges did not have any kind of
discretion
so but but that's in that but that's in
the revised code i mean
the general assembly decided what the
legislation
i mean with the registration
requirements would be
and and that's what i would like to
point to state b sterling because
the issue we have they're substantially
similar to the one we had
in that case where a prosecuting
attorney before the uh a request for
by an inmate for dna testing could be
reviewed for any decision by the um
judicial branch was was the prosecutor
was the prosecutor in this case opposed
to a 10-year
term no um so
is this case even properly be forced i
mean did the did the judge
was the problem here the judge said i
don't have any discretion to do this
as i mentioned in my reply brief there's
two bases
um that i believe that we are properly
here the first being that
the record um doesn't have any kind of
investigating
investigative agency so as i mentioned
before
we have to have both of these requests
on the record right what
about the judge i mean i mean you're
i mean it doesn't seem here the problem
was that the judge
thought that he couldn't impose a
10-year term the record seems pretty
clear he just didn't want to
i i i disagree that the record is clear
from that there's several moments
on both in the plea and the sentencing
where the judge says
i have to inform you that there is a
mandatory registration without
mentioning any kind of possibility of a
reduction
uh and and again there is no mention of
the requirements the investigating
agency
um i'll would request that reduction
so not only that now so let me ask a
question
if we agree with you and we sever out
subsection b in its entirety doesn't
your client lose
what i believe would happen under the
geiger test
is that it needs to be remanded or
resented
uh that the way that the
unconstitutional
um but heart of the eliminated if we
eliminate the provision you're saying is
unconstitutional the only
right the judge has is to make it
forever for the life of the arsonist
well so as i explained in my mayor
briefed up
our position is that the portion so we
don't need to
remove the entirety of d2b but only a
portion of it
um specifically the conditional
requirement that
you can reduce it to a non-mandatory
lifetime not less than 10 years
if the prosecuting attorney
investigating uh
agency allows it that's what everything
everywhere doesn't enforce the intent of
the legislature and they
obviously felt that there could be a
change but
under only under certain conditions so
wouldn't we have to donate the entire
provision
i think there are two apparent
intentions here the first
uh which is mentioned in state v read uh
that analyzed this registration is that
there's a need here to want to protect
the public but also which is mentioned
in state b ding is that
there's a apparent intention to have
some
kind of option if not lifetime i think
the best analogy to this is
a decision this court made four years
ago in state of knowing
where it was an issue about how the
review was supposed to happen
so in that case um the specific
statute uh was that was senator
an offender sentenced to death may
appeal trial force denial of application
for post-conviction dna testing
by seeking leave of the supreme court in
that case
by taking out the levo supreme court the
intention
was still there the overall scheme was
still there
but the unconstitutional function to
take now
our position is that the
unconstitutional function to get to that
exception is by giving the executive
branch
this unconstitutional power counselor if
if the prosecuting attorney and the
investigator
request that the registration period be
for 10 years instead of lifetime
is it required do you read the statute
to require that the court
make the registration ten years yeah
i believe that that and actually that is
how
i would prefer the statute be severed
that the judge just
have that discretion uh
so they can make the request and the
judge can deny the request and still
impose the lifetime registration
requirement correct
right then how is it that you're saying
this executive branch
allows or disallows or gets to control
what
the trial court sentence or what the
trial court
decides with registration
the statute only allows the request and
i understand
i i think the statute is problematic too
in that the request can only come from
the prosecuting attorney and
along with the investigative agency that
the way the statute is written the
defense counsel can't even make the
request
but it but it is just a request and
although there might be some problems
with the statute how is it if they
cannot dictate what the trial court does
how is it a problem with separation of
powers
uh and to bring it back to stevie
sterling so the way
uh our position is is that in let's
just for just for sterling that i'm an
inmate who wants to
ask the court for a dna test but there's
a stop in the middle
and it has to the prosecutors have to
say yes you're allowed to move on
or they can stop it right there
here the request it's completely
ascendant thing
that let's say the defender the
defendant wants to ask for
uh some sort of reduction but
the judge can't consider that because
there's a stop just like there was in
sterling
if the investigating agency and the
prosecutor doesn't
also agree the judge cannot consider it
under this under how it's written
currently
so it doesn't have to be the even the
defense attorney asking for it if the
judge
in their discretion you know in
sentencing
would like to impose 10 years but
their hands are tied and they have to do
the lifetime appointment
because the trigger to get to the 10
year the lesser requirement is
the action by the prosecutor and the
investigating agency in tandem
and i find that to be problematic
because of the uh it's it's
um the the imposition it puts on the
judge
of not being able to use you know there
there's a
there's a lesser uh registration
requirement to be had
but the step to get there uh doesn't
allow the judge to use discretion
i agree and i think that's the
overruling influence that
that was argued in sterling but i also
want to move on to
this another point that there's two ways
that
this uh doctrine is violated uh one we
haven't talked about is that this is
a final decision and again it's kind of
the same
idea that i was talking about with this
stop this is a sentencing issue so even
even in sterling where uh there's a
relevant power
uh of the executive branch to prove
guilt or innocence and dna was related
to that power
here is entirely sentencing and
by having this kind of stop gap from
it to to the judge they're making a
decision
that is appealable to no one and just as
it was
found unconstitutional on that basis in
sterling i agree that that is an
entirely separate reason that this
course in the statute is also
unconstitutional so there are two
entirely different ways that that we get
to that point
so um i do want to get
uh back to the geiger test because i
think that the issue here is going to be
the um the way it reads
and i know we've we've brought it up
before the first and third question is
whether or not it needs any additional
insertion of words
or if it can stand by itself you take
out every other word in this provision
after
if then you have discretion that the
judge can decide a mandatory lifetime
not lesson or all the way up to not less
than uh 10 years
that is the sentencing power that mr
carlisle is asking for
that's why he's asking that it'd be
remanded
so that this that his sentence at least
considered properly
that it was we're not sure if it was
clear from the record that the judge
believed she could even constitutionally
the or the plea would have been
incorrect because
you there was no investigating agency on
the record
and all of those issues are relevant
here
but i think state v nolling again is is
the best example
of where the ultimate framework of
the statute was more important than the
function that was not working so
just to there where the the way that the
appeal was brought up do the
attorney at trial raise the argument
that you're raising here
the attorney at the police sentence made
it made a um an objection
uh majority below did believe that
they didn't make a proper constitutional
objection but reviewed it
on uh on the standing issue that i also
i didn't mention
uh before mentioned in my brief that uh
it is a issue of great constitutionality
that even if his mootness was destroyed
um which i
forest is standing was destroyed on
moveness which i don't think it does
there's still a case law that supports
that uh this case being reviewed
if there are another other questions
i'll conclude that
this course should find that ohio
revised code 2909
15 d2b is unconstitutional several
language that affords the prosecuting
attorney and investigating agency
discretion
is a reversal or course decision
thank you council
good morning chief justice may i please
the court
the arson registry statute does not
invade the inherent
power of the judiciary and so is
constitutional
it does not interfere with the court's
determination of guilt
it the determination of guilt is made
by the conviction of arson itself which
subjects the person to the registry so
this is not the same as the sterling
case
and choosing the right sentence requires
all three branches of government
to be involved in some fashion the
legislature picks the range
for the crime sets the crime it sets the
punishment the prosecutor chooses what
to prosecute
which itself may have effects on the
sentence that's available
and restrict some sentences from being
available
and the judge imposes the sentence from
among the options
this is how sentencing works it is not
an area where there is an inherent
exclusive power of the judiciary
council could the could the legislature
write a law
let's just say a felony of the second
degree with a sentencing range would be
two to eight years in prison
um and say uh the sentencing range is
two to eight years in prison however
the judge cannot go below five unless
the
prosecutor gives their consent to this
would that be constitutional
i think it would your honor because the
statute can set forth what the criminal
penalties are
and the prosecutor has a role that's
akin to
the charging decision the decision to
plea bargain
the decision among which charges to
pursue after an allied offense
determination and merger is made
i don't think it departs from that and
in this case
certainly the finding of the arson
conviction itself that's the
key fact that's determined and that
there's no question that the trial court
made that finding here based on
the defendant's no contest plea
and in terms of the sentencing
process in the legislature that that has
been a legislative
area in terms of setting the the what
the crime is what the punishment is
that has been true for for some time and
as this court has said
uh a sentence that is inconsistent with
the sentencing statute is
is not even a sentence and so
i i know this question i'm about to ask
you
this really is not specifically before
us but but how does this
work i mean what factors
are considered in a request to reduce
the registration
to 10 years and and and does the trial
court
excuse me does the trial court get to
inquire as to why
there is that request and and do the
requesters have to
you know set forth um something
um articulable other than
they like the defendant and or you know
you know just some
some reason to request that the
registration period be reduced
your honor the sentence doesn't specify
factors
however if if the court were to look at
the sentencing transcript in this case
which is the august 2018
transcript of pages three to four you
you can see how
how it plays out in in this instance the
the defense counsel
asked for the the reduced registration
and represented to the court that the
prosecutor did not
uh the prosecutor agreed with it when
the prosecutor stood up he said
um basically yes i do i don't object to
this
based on his involvement in the case up
to that point to
to address a related point about the
prosecutor and the investigating
agency asking for this certainly the
prosecutor
ordinarily works with the investigating
agency and
can be expected to speak really on
behalf of both
since they're both representing the
state um and there's no indication here
that the investigating agency had any
different view of this matter
but but so what the statute allows is
the investigate the prosecuting
attorney and the investigative and and
what if the two of them
disagree if the two disagree then the
request
isn't valid i mean if if
one of them agrees and the other does
not the court has no
authority to reduce the registration
period is that how you read the statute
i i think it can be read that way
although again in this case we certainly
don't know
i know i know what you're saying i'm
just talking about the the logical
inferences or what logically could
happen here
or if there was a particularly
acrimonious a relationship between
defense counsel and prosecuting attorney
the pres defense counsel might ask the
prosecuting attorney for this reduction
and arbitrarily the prosecuting attorney
could say no
even though the facts would warrant it
well again i i think your honor we start
from the
the point that the general assembly has
set out
that this is a mandatory duty that flows
from the arson conviction itself
i agree i agree and again i know we're
looking at separation of
of powers here but it just i guess it
just seems strange
that um there would be the power
from the perspective of the prosecuting
attorney
and the and the um and the investigator
to
lower um sanctions
former defendant when that's really
that's defense counsel's baileywick
where you think they make the request
that they hold the power to
to initiate request and and actually
um to initiate a lowering of the
defendant's
sanction when the defense counsel can't
even do that
but but as i said earlier i you know
whether it's a separation or powers
issue is a different
question to respond
to your honors question a couple of
things in addition to the general
assembly's role you have the
the role the prosecutor in other
instances to make the charging decision
when to plea bargain when to
send someone to a pre-trial diversion
program and those are not thought to
count as a separation of powers problem
to to respond to that point another
analogy i offer for your consideration
is the
under the state's previous indeterminate
sentencing law
you had the adult parole authority
essentially making determinations
um you'd have a an indeterminate
sentence for a longer period of time and
the parole authority would decide
really how long that person would serve
in the
that prison term and that
if you think about it is is not all that
different from
this situation where you have a
prosecutor saying well i think
this person might be a candidate for
a lesser uh registration time and again
bear in mind the registry is only is not
public it is
it is for access by the fire marshal and
by
certain uh fire personnel presumably to
assist in public safety and
and arson investigations which can be
somewhat involved so this is
this is a a little bit different from
some other things for that reason
council you say the prosecutor has these
post-conviction discretionary
um uh you know well not really i mean
uh participation in a diversion program
which is the prosecutor's diversion
program that
you know that's where it resides so
that's a little different
um but here where does law enforcement
the investigating agency
come in uh post a
conviction uh and uh kind of hold the
strings on
on uh what the judge can do
well it's as i said there's separation
of powers let me step back for a minute
separation of powers
as a matter of degree as as your honors
no it's
um it's not like each branch of
government is put in a hermetically
sealed box and so
you're going to have different
interactions at different points in the
system and that's not a problem under
separation of powers and sentencing is a
good example of that because you've got
the three branches with different roles
sometimes to a degree intersect
and that that is allowable um
under separated powers i i offered the
uh analogy on
the question is my question is
where does where does the investigating
agency
exercise that kind of authority you have
it with an elected prosecutor
you have it with other you know
executive branch but i don't see it with
the police all right thank you i
thank you for clarifying i misunderstood
your question i i think that
in most cases probably 99
of cases i can't imagine uh that you
would have
a discrepancy between the prosecutor and
the law enforcement agency
because they do work in tandem why not
just have one
why not just have the prosecutor if
they're aligned but they don't the
statute says both
so explain that to me on how the uh to
me
how the how this authority
given to law enforcement uh can be
uh exercised to thwart the discretion of
a judge
your honor i would i would suggest that
it's because it's unlikely to occur that
this case doesn't present that and
and i don't know that i would want to
speculate too much on how that
might operate in an unusual situation
where there was a discrepancy in a
recommendation because it's
it seems more like the way the statute
is written it's hard to say
whether um it's really an independent
basis
to to block that or it's more a
recognition that
the prosecutor and the law enforcement
agency would be
recommending together because the law
enforcement folks would have had some
interaction with the
individual as they did here if you look
at the defense council's comments she
said all the investigators had a
positive opinion of her
client as a follow-up to that question
couldn't the law enforcement agency just
pocket veto it by not showing up
giving its opinion no your honor because
i think again
you would presume the prosecutor is the
lawyer involved in the case
would be the one speaking to the court
about the recommendation and i
i don't think that would be unusual to
think that that would be a
recommendation from both particularly if
the law enforcement agency isn't coming
in and contradicting it as they
certainly did not hear
but council you would agree that the
statute is written
even though you find it it'd probably be
unlikely
a that as britain
the investigative officer can if you
disagree with the prosecutor's
recommendation to have it reduced as it
was
recommended in this particular case he
could say no i don't agree with that
and and restrict the judge's
uh discretion to act on that
i think that would be a an unusual case
and one to to look at how this statute
would operate
at that time but in any event it's there
have been
other uh since we're talking in either
case about the executive branch
and they're both part of the executive
branch it's not unusual to have
discretion in the executive branch at
various levels whether it's the
parole authority whether it's the
governor and his pardon authority or
whether it's a prosecutor
the executive branch obviously you say
has many facets um
and there's a big difference between a
recommendation
uh and the ability to thwart another
branch of government
from doing you know having exercising
their authority
um and here it's not the
uh recommendation that i'm concerned
about
it's the ability to thwart and that's
you know that rests with the police
well i i guess i would see it
differently your honor i i see it as
almost like a separate
uh chart you can have for example you
could imagine two charges one with a
mandatory
lifetime registration and one with
a registration that's subject to being
lowered
if somebody if the prosecutor or the
prosecutor with the police recommended
it and
we wouldn't think that that having the
two different
charges with the two different results
would be as
the results of a of an arson conviction
would be a problem under separation of
powers and i don't believe it is here
either
just because a prosecutor recommends a
sentence
doesn't mean the court has to accept it
correct in sentencing in sentencing
decision that
this is this is somewhat different from
that but i think a process you could
have a statute
where there could be a recommendation
that was written in
such a way that allowed the prosecutor
to have a role
in uh input in the sentence i i don't
think that is
off the table for separation of powers
purposes is this a criminal sentence i
mean is this a criminal punishment at
all
i think that's an issue your honor that
you don't need to decide in this case
because either way it doesn't affect the
separation of powers analysis whether
it's
punishment or not although it certainly
has some uh
it has characteristics of a civil
remedial
provision which is what it's not
characterized
if it's not a punishment isn't a real
easy question i mean
the executive branches has all kinds of
civil
uh registration requirements so if if
it's not a punishment then
it doesn't seem like any of these issues
are implicated would they be
i i would agree with your honor i think
that's that's a fair
uh assessment if this is the civil
remedial provision and that is what the
courts of appeals have characterized it
as and and it is
it certainly has those characteristics
although again
i don't know you'd have to decide that
here if i may briefly respond on the
severability point um
as somebody noted the geiger test does
talk about whether something can
stand on its own and hear the language
that the defendant would like
for you to take out of the statute the
if the judge receives a request from the
prosecutor etc
that can't stand on its own so under the
geiger test
as it's been applied uh for the most
part over the years this would not be
the proper way to sever and to sever it
the
and when i say sever i mean hold
unenforceable
um in in this instance um the way to do
that is as we suggest in our brief
would be to take all of d2b out which
would then
leave anyone with a lifetime
registration i see that my time is
expired
and if there are no further questions i
thank the court
ask the court to either dismiss the case
or from the judgment below
thank you i'd like to address two
specific points the
first being that the arguments made
by the state um have in my opinion a
flawed basis of where
the judicial branch and executive branch
should end i think one of the most
egregious
points was uh the answer to one of the
justice questions that
if a range was from two to eight years
but a cross feeder
without an agreement but say make it not
less or more than five
and that would be constitutional in my
opinion that is
implicitly explicitly
giving the executive branch is there a
criminal punishment in this case
it is why it's purely a registration
requirement it's not
uh it's it's not available to the
general public it's a lot different
than any i think all the lower courts
that have looked at the registry have
said
said it's civil not uh not criminal
so this is the second point i wanted to
get to so the first
um response i want to make is that st
williams
made a sex offender registration uh
they determined that was punitive and
this is a lot different than that right
i don't believe that there's any support
for that the language in state b
williams is that
notification and registration is
punitive
there's no distinction that one is more
or less punitive than the other there's
no case law that establishes that
only notification but not registration
is
punitive wait a second wait a second
state b
williams the court distinguished its
prior case law
didn't overrule it uh which said that
which said that note that no
notification requirements and
registration
in those circumstances were not punitive
this seems a lot more like those than
the scheme and williams doesn't i i
disagree i think that there's enough
similarities in the registration
namely that it subjects you
to a ten years to a lifetime where if
you
are on parole or prc and you fail to
register then that's a violation
if you that isn't of itself is a felony
five if you fail to register
you have to register every year in any
violation of that
subjects you the criminal punishment i
also want to go
to a definition that was established in
state behance where the court was
looking at the difference between
uh juvenile adjudication report before
you do that i mean you would agree that
that if it's if we conclude that it's
civil then there's there can't be a
there can't be a separation of power
problems here in there
i i still disagree only because it would
it would
nullify the first argument i made but i
i believe it's still
a non-appealable issue even even on a
civil
case it would still be a non-appealable
decision made by the executive branch
there's all kinds of non-appealable
decisions executive
branch agencies make
at this point the executive so i
if i may continue well uh
the one thing i didn't get to go to a
little bit in my rebuttal is the
distinction of where
the executive branch and the judicial
branch are
uh we are past any kind of charging
decisions
we are past the plea of guilty all these
decisions are being made at the
sentencing level
and when the executive branch is able to
start making decisions
about how that sentencing is affected
even if it's
this particular um case where we're
hypothetically calling it civil i still
think that's a non-appealable decision
that
still violates the separation of powers
um if that's if there's no further
questions
thank you thank you uh we'll take the
matter under advisement and you'll be
notified of our decision
marshall will you call a recess please
court will now adjourn for a brief
recess
so
so
wow
so
so
so
so
so
so
so
2019-1765 in the matter of the complaint
of suburban natural gas company versus
columbia gas of ohio
incorporated uh for the appellant uh mr
miss boyco
thank you your honor chief justice
o'connor honorable justices
may it please the court my name is kim
boyco and i'm with carpenter lips and
leland
today i'm representing suburban natural
gas company the appellant in this case
i would like to reserve five minutes of
my time for rebuttal
in the case below the commission ignored
ohio law
the record below the commission's own
precedent
and this court's precedent in three
respects
first the commission failed to enforce a
1995 stipulation
and releases and covenants not to sue
that it approved
second the commission failed to find
that colombia implemented its builder
incentive program
in an unfair and anti-competitive manner
to expand its service territory
third the commission failed to prohibit
the unreasonable
and unlawful duplication of utility
facilities
in contravention of the public interest
ohio law
is clear a commission order must be
reversed modified or vacated
if this court finds it to be unlawful or
unreasonable
the commission's orders in the case
below are not only unreasonable and
unlawful but they depart from past
precedent
and are unsupported by the record
therefore appellant asks the court to
reverse or modify
it's important to put this case into
context the dispute between these two
parties began in 1986
when suburban filed a complaint against
colombia
alleging that colombia was violating
ohio law and its tariffs by providing
various anti-competitive incentives
to customers for the purpose of
destroying competition
including free service lines and reduced
rates
the commission agreed with suburban and
found that colombia was unlawfully
violating its tariffs
then in 1987 colombia attempted to
revise its tariffs
to authorize these anti-competitive
practices
suburban objected to colombia
implementing the same anti-competitive
incentives that the club
that the commission had ruled were
unlawful
the case resulted in colombia
implementing tariff restrictions
which explicitly prohibited colombia
from offering incentives to compete
unless competitors also offered the same
incentives
over the years issues continue to arise
regarding colombia's anti-competitive
incentives
and the duplication of facilities so in
1995 the parties entered into
an omnibus agreement by which the
parties agreed to exchange
certain customers and facilities to
prevent duplication
and to rationalize their systems and to
amend their respective tariffs
to restrict builder incentives in
rendering its decisions in the case
below
the commission overlooked this important
history
in the litigation that led up to the
1995 stipulation
the whole reason for the parties to
enter into the settlement
and the purpose of the settlement were
completely ignored by the commission
as well as the explicit language of the
stipulation
appellate's interpretations basically
render the 1995 stipulation
meaningless as this court is aware
contracts must be construed in their
entirety and in a manner that
does not leave any phrase meaningless
additionally when con
confronted with an issue of contract
interpretation
this court has held that its role is to
give effect to the intent of the parties
examine the contract as a whole and
presume the language of the con
tract reflects the intent of the parties
in 1995 and so i'm looking at the
language of the
of the release and it says column will
release or
columbia further covenants and agrees
that it will forever refrain
from instituting reinstating or
prosecuting
any action or proceeding against
suburban
so how does that language support your
arguments now
yes your honor if you continue on down
page two of that stipulation
it says instituting or reinstating a
program constituting relating to
or based on the builder incentive
programs
or any program substantially similar
to such programs the 1995 stipulation
required both parties
to list any incentive programs in the
company's tariffs
and restricted either company from
paying incentives
when competing with another company that
does not also have those incentives
and consistent with 4905 30 and 32
the 1995 stipulation only authorizes
incentives to the extent those
incentives are actually approved by the
commission
and included in the company's tariffs so
what does the columbia tariff actually
authorize
well if we look at the tariff the tariff
authorizes
a builder incentive program within
columbia service territory and for
energy efficiency purposes the
commission approved colombia's
application
specifically authorizing colombia to pay
incentives
under the builder program only for homes
located within columbia service
territory and for
customers served by colombia
in violation of this energy efficiency
program
paid for by columbia's customers
columbia
implemented the builder incentive
program outside its service territory
in competition with suburban
the appalee has defined colombia's
service territory as the general
geographic
area where colombia has facilities
servicing or capable of servicing ohio
residents
even using this expansive definition
that may have absurd results
the glenn cross development the
development at issue fell
outside columbus at columbia's service
territory
at the time the incentives were offered
by colombia
and colombia was not capable of serving
that development in order to serve the
development columbia had to
expand a mile worth of pipeline
extension
at no cost to the developer and in doing
so the extension
passed hundreds of homes already served
by suburban
and duplicating suburban's existing
facilities
record evidence also shows that
columbia's sales team
used the builder incentive as a
competitive response tool
in order to expand its service territory
at the time
columbia offered the builder incentives
to the developer
it did not have facilities serving or
capable of serving glenn ross residents
therefore the commission's conclusion
that it is within columbia service
territory
when incentives were offered was
unsupported by the record
and contrary to pele's claims the
commission has previously recognized
established markets
and it has stated that incentives or
special rates
should not be used with the intent to
raid
the established markets of other gas
utilities
as what was the case here additionally
if you look at columbia's tariff
columbia did not implement the builder
incentive program for energy efficiency
purposes as required there's unrefuted
record evidence that explained that the
builder incentive programs did not
encourage
or incentivize more energy efficient
homes
and the incentives were not strictly
tied to energy efficiency initiatives
in fact as mentioned before columbia's
sales team admitted to using the
incentives
as a competitive response tool not an
authorized
purpose commission has previously denied
applications for energy efficiency
programs where the program
appeared to be a competitive response
tool competing for new load
further the commission has previously
explained that is never
approved a writer with the intended
purpose of a standalone program
that was not directed to a utility's
existing customers
but was then charged to those existing
customers
the commission's conclusion that the
energy efficiency program was used for
its intended purpose
to encourage energy efficiency programs
within colombia's service territory
to benefit colombia's customers who pay
for those programs
was unsupported by the record
the 1995 stipulation also specifically
addressed the prohibition
of duplication of facilities again
to settle the underlining issues in
these cases
as part of the 1995 stipulation if you
look at page two
the parties agreed to transfer certain
facilities and customers between the
parties in order to rationalize
each country each company's distribution
system
and when the parties transferred
customers to each other they also
transferred the right and obligation to
serve those customers
the parties were separating their
systems and transferring customers
to prevent the duplication of system
additionally the 1995 stipulation
contained a provision that
only authorized duplication in certain
circumstances
the there was an exception the exception
allowed colombia to construct
high-pressure pipelines
for purposes of transporting natural gas
through
suburban service territory in order to
serve other areas
served by colombia if the 1995
stipulation did not
prohibit duplication as a general matter
there would be no need to create this
exception
allowing duplication in certain
circumstances instead this entire
provision would be redundant and
unnecessary which would contravene the
requirement
of the commission to give meaning to
every provision in a contract
the stipulation also specifically stated
that the commission retains
continuing jurisdiction over this matter
to supervise
and assure the parties are in compliance
with the 1995 stipulation
again if the stipulation had no
application to prevent duplication of
facilities in the future
this provision would be pointless there
would be no need for this provision
allowing colombia to needlessly
duplicate suburban facilities is also
not in the public interest
as customers have to pay for the
duplication
yes the regulatory landscape in ohio
allows reasonable competition
the competition has to be reasonable
among natural gas distribution companies
in khalid the commission
recognized reasonable competition and
that the
absence of certified territories does
not
in and of itself defeat a cause of
action against a competitor
who duplicates facilities
your honors columbia violated the 1995
stipulation and exceeded the authority
granted to it by the commission
and its own tariff it utilized the
builder incentive program as a
competitive response tool
to unreasonably compete with suburban
and to unnecessarily duplicate
facilities
the commission's orders were unjust
unreasonable
and not in the public interest and they
should be
overturned or modified thank you
thank you
um mr lindgren
thank you may i please the court my name
is thomas lundgren and i represent the
public utilities commission of ohio
i would like to reserve five minutes of
my time for council for columbia gas
your honors state law and policy permit
and even encourage
competition in the natural gas industry
as the appellant's council acknowledged
now competition gives customers
choices but suburban here is asking for
protection
from competition and that would have the
effect of limiting customers choices
suburban seems to want to have an
exclusive territory where they don't
want to have to face where they don't
have to face competition
they want to be able to expand their
service area while
locking columbia into the areas it
already serves
i want to be clear about one thing there
are no exclusive territories for gas
companies
in the natural gas industry in the state
of ohio as there are for electric
companies
as the commission has stated any
certified gas company may serve
customers
anywhere in the state has been talked
about as service territory
as uh the the commission uh uh
defined it uh that's the general area
where the company is serving or capable
of serving customers
it's not exclusive and is subject to
change
one company isn't locked into a
particular area it can expand that area
and that's what columbia did here
it expanded its pipelines to serve a new
residential development as the the home
builder there
chose chose colombia
the the commission reviewed the 1995
stipulation
which had had approved and found that it
did not bar columbia from offering
energy efficiency incentives
or otherwise serving customers in
southern southern delaware county
the commission had approved this
stipulation originally
it's really in the best position to
interpret that stipulation and i would
ask the court to give that
interpretation deference
the stipulation resolved the dispute
over particular customers
and it said nothing about energy
efficiency programs
or any geographic limitations on
either company's ability to serve there
were some programs that were
in effect then they were discontinued
but those
are not comparable to the programs that
we have now with columbia which are
energy efficiency programs
there are no programs of that kind back
in 1995.
i would add that even if the stipulation
could be
could be read to limit competition or
fix uh
territories that would violate state law
and policy
and would be unenforceable i would offer
the court an analogy
say there were two law firms here in
columbus that had a
dispute over who was entitled to uh the
fee
from a particular uh case
and uh they ended up resolving this case
not only over the fee but saying
well firm a will only take clients from
north abroad and
firm b will only take clients from south
of broad street
well i don't think these court would
approve of such an agreement in fact
i think it would violate the court of
professional conduct and the court
certainly would not enforce that that's
basically what suburban is asking you
to do here to enforce uh an agreement
that in their mind
limits customer choices
the commission also examined what
colombia was doing with its uh demand
sign management or dsm program
it looked at the order where it had
approved these programs and found no
violations
the commission uh further noted that an
advantage shouldn't be
taken away from colombia just because
the other competing company
doesn't have a similar incentive and i
would like to make
another point very clear suburban could
have its own
dsm program if it filed a proper
application
and obtained approval suburban had filed
an application for such a program back
in 2011
but the commission found it defective
and sent it back
well for whatever reason uh suburban in
the past nine years
had never has never even attempted to uh
to refile an application for for a
program that met the requirements
but customers shouldn't be penalized
just because suburban
uh doesn't have this program uh hasn't
even applied for
customers should be able to take
advantage of these programs
when they're when they're being offered
yeah mr lindgren
what what do you have to say about miss
boyko's
comments regarding the energy efficiency
standards
um that as i understand are saying that
we're not
really satisfied here well your honor
the commission still found that uh
there were no violations of the uh
energy efficiency
standards they found that found that the
uh
that club he had comply with the
commission rose in the commission order
and uh that uh
are those findings reviewable by us uh
yes but i would ask you to defer to the
uh commission's factual findings in this
area and defer to their their expertise
in this area
i would add that uh columbia's uh dsm
program is subject to an annual audit
to make sure that all their uh money is
being spent properly and if the
commission
or staff finds any violations uh that
can be uh dealt with and uh
uh money uh recoup for customers
if it's been misused
thank you uh your honor
your honors uh the customers in delaware
county shouldn't be denied access to the
dsm
program simply because suburban is
not able really through their own choice
of being able to offer the same program
suburban had the burden of proof to show
violations of the stipulation
or any of commissioned law or order they
haven't done so
this uh they haven't met their burden of
proof this order is lawful and
reasonable
and it should be affirmed are you the
remainder of my time to counsel for
columbia gas
thank you mr stem thank you good morning
may it pleased the court mark stem for
columbia gas
of ohio columbia stands on its merit
brief but would like to offer
three observations about suburban's
reply brief and the argument we've heard
today
these will underscore why the 1995
stipulation is irrelevant
and why suburban's waiver and failures
of proof below
mean that this court need not reach
suburban's legal challenges
of colombia's dsm incentive program
in alleged duplication of facilities
first in a significant departure from
its initial brief
suburban at page seven of its reply
brief
admits that colombia's dsm energy
efficiency incentive
is authorized by tariff and not
prohibited by the 95 stipulation
when implemented for homes within
colombia's service territory
these admissions leave suburban arguing
as it is today
that colombia's use of the term service
territory
in its dsm application that was approved
by the commission
actually meant to exclude from the
incentive program
every home in the area that later became
glenn ross south
in southern delaware county but that is
precisely the definitional question the
commission decided against suburban
which suburban chose
not to raise for re-hearing thus
depriving this court of jurisdiction to
now consider it
we underscored this waiver at re-hearing
at pages 41-42 of our merit breed
and suburban did not reply my second
observation concerns suburban's
argument that columbia gained an unfair
competitive advantage
by simply publicizing the fact of its
home builder program
to polti homes that argument fails for
many reasons but
certainly as a matter of evidence the
commission found that suburban failed to
prove
that the program incentives even
factored into polti's decision
to select colombia over suburban
so the court need not reach the
arguments that follow
similarly suburban as my third point
lacks the factual predicate for all of
its legal theories for prohibiting
duplication of facilities
specifically the commission did not find
that duplication occurred
as a result of colombia's actions
lacking these static
factual predicates for its arguments
suburban is raising hypothetical legal
questions
and seeking advisory opinions
now turning to the issue of duplication
of facilities in greater detail
the very label does not accurately
characterize the work
to bring natural gas to a never before
served greenfield
the um pipeline that was put in
that bypassed the suburban neighborhood
and extended to this glenroth south
was that put in before the agreement was
made with the builder
which agreement with the builder are you
referring to the incentive program with
the builder
okay your honor the incentive program
that we're referring to was was first
approved in 2009 by the commission
i understand that but then it was
offered to the developer i guess
of this yes the wrong term that the
developer
was the pipeline extended before that
was solidified uh no your honor when the
columbia sales team was talking with the
developer about all the reasons why
colombia could provide better service
the dsm incentive program was one
attribute of what colombia brings
to the table and that discussion
predated
the actual decision by the developer to
choose colombia
but there were so many reasons that
colombia gave that distinguished itself
from suburban
there's no evidence as found by the
commission that the fact of the
incentive program was actually
the factor in the decision by the
developer and in fact your honor there's
evidence in the record
from ms young who talked to the
developer directly about this
and the developer told her that the
incentives were really a non-factor
because they did not nearly cover the
cost
of meeting the energy efficiency
standards in terms of the construction
that would be required
in addition to to meet those standards
and when you think about the duplication
issue the main is just one
small part of the facility's expansion
to serve a new green field
there's also distribution sub mains for
every subdivision street in this new
12-phase
subdivision and service lines have to be
installed from the curb of every street
to every of the 400 building lots none
of which duplicates anything suburban
has done
and suburban was not displaced by
colombia's main
suburban's main still brings natural gas
to the 10 phases of residential
development on the north side
cheshire road among other parcels
and the delaware county deputy engineer
testified that it was commonplace in
southern delaware county
for mains like this to run along each
side
each other or across each other whether
on one side of the street or on the same
side of the street
in this case on the other side of the
street and the commission has long
encouraged competition between natural
gas utilities to provide the customer
choice that polti homes benefited from
and customer choice would be lost if the
service provider
was determined solely by which utility
has the nearest pipeline
and we should note your honors that the
suburban's legal and
policy objections to so-called
duplication
all evaporate whenever suburban wins in
competition for new large customers with
colombia
as we briefed at page 20 suburban
sees no issue at all when extending its
main a mile away
to reach and serve a new development
where colombia's main
is already located the disconnect here
is that suburban is seeking a double
standard every argument suburban makes
and it's this case
and i should add as noted at page 39 of
our merit brief
every dubious perpetual service
agreement suburban has
obtained outside of this case from
owners of large undeveloped tracks
they are all aimed at extinguishing
colombia's right to compete in southern
delaware county
which suburban seeks to protect as its
exclusive
service territory i would like to
address a couple of questions i heard
while i was waiting um first of all in
terms of the releases on the stipulation
nothing in the stipulation speaks to
what's going to happen in the future
that was a very specific agreement that
indicated it was so
it was resolving an existing dispute by
exchanging facilities and customers
the releases to the stipulation did
nothing but release
suburbans claims against each other
relating to a series of listed builder
programs
which were not commission approved
energy efficiency programs
they did not prohibit either company
from engaging any specific activities
in the future they simply preserve
suburban's right to file an
action if colombia engages in activities
in the future in a specific area
they certainly contain no prohibition
and the contention today that we saw for
the first time in the reply brief
that paragraph 10 of the stipulation
which concerns that high pressure
pipeline mention
note your honors suburban did not raise
at any time
below or in its notice of appeal it's
argument that the 1995 stipulation
contains
one exception to the general ban it
claims on duplication of facilities
and that the pipeline serving glenn ross
does not qualify for that exception they
cannot raise it for the first time
in its reply brief before the ohio
supreme court
and i would note that the language of
that paragraph does not support
their interpretation in any event
with that i would answer any further
questions your honors have
if not i would say i would argue that
the commission's decision was clearly
lawful and reasonable
and should be affirmed thank you very
much
thank you miss boyko uh you've saved
uh about three minutes and 50 seconds
you'll have to unmute your your
microphone
thank you your honor first i'd like to
correct a few missed statements
first of all if you look at page 2 of
the 1995 stipulation
and then go to page 7 it actually does
list the mark of efficiency program
as an efficiency program that existed at
the time as well as three builder
incentive programs
these programs are similarly situated
and thus are prohibited by the 1995
stipulation
the 1995 stipulation and the
interpretation of its very terms
has always been at the heart of this
case and for council
to suggest otherwise is just does not
make any sense we have stated that the
commission
failed to follow the 1995 stipulation
specific language
on page two of the stipulation it says
that this case is a resolution
of the party's competitive dispute and
rationalization of their distribution
system
the duplication of the system has been
at the heart of this issue
from the very very beginning to be clear
suburban is not challenging the energy
efficiency program itself
it is challenging how colombia is using
the builder incentive program a part of
that program
as a competitive tool suburban did try
to file
its own builder incentive program as a
competitive tool
and that case was rejected because the
commission said
it never approved a writer with its
intended purpose
of a standalone program that was not
directed to the utility's existing
customers
but was charged to those customers
and to mr lindgren's point suburban
could not
offer a dsm program to the extent of
columbia
gas it has 17 000 customers not a
million customers it couldn't spread the
cost
that could compete with colombia and
that is the whole point
the energy efficiency program was just
that it was to incentivize
energy-efficient homes within colombia's
service territory
as you as chief justice recognized
colombia went outside their
territory offered these incentives and
then had to construct a facility
to be able to support and serve those
customers
that is not prohibited or that is not
allowed
by both the 1995 stipulation as well as
the energy efficiency program itself
that was approved by the commission
and put in its tariffs colombia can
expand its territory no one is arguing
that it can't
but it has to do it in an
anti-competitive manner
and it also has to do it with reasonable
competition
it can't use builder incentives in an
improper way
4905 33b prohibits using
free service or incentives
to destroy competition and 4905
35 a prohibits causing undue or
unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage
to a company
that is exactly what colombia is doing
under the guise of an energy efficiency
program
the commission has historically
exercised its authority
to prevent duplication of facilities for
public utility service
it's in the public interest customers
end up
paying for the duplicate duplication of
facilities
the commission has the authority it's
used it in the past
apellys have not demonstrated why
natural gas utilities
should be treated differently than any
of the other utilities that don't have
certified territories
the commission should prevent
duplication of natural gas facilities
the public interest actually mandates
that it do so
colombia violated the 1995 stipulation
it's using its energy efficiency program
in an improper
manner that exceeds the authority
granted to it and it should be reversed
thank you thank you we'll take the
matter under advisement and you'll be
notified of our decision
our next k our last taste today is
2019-1769
the state of ohio versus roger simpson
uh for the appellant
mrs troutman
chief justice and justices of the court
may please the court my name is rachel
troutman and i represent the amicus
curay on behalf of roger simpson
i'd like to reserve three minutes for a
rebuttal please
so the ohio public defender as amicus
curie urges this court to reverse
the lower court's decision and to hold
that at that initial application stage
of the 26b
an applicant should not be required to
demonstrate
that he conclusively demonstrate
prejudice
a genuine issue of a colorable claim
should be something less
that should be rep that should be
reserved for the second stage of the
application process
in 2016. so requiring
a an applicant to establish prejudice
for a paladin effectiveness in that
application stage
it does not fit with the purpose behind
26b
essentially the courts are deciding the
underlying issue before they're ever
hearing the case on the merits
so the purpose of 2016 is to give
defendants that opportunity that they
missed
and it started with state versus monahan
in this court
it's a means for enforcing that right to
the effective assistance of appellate
council
this court
how do we determine effectiveness versus
ineffectiveness
if prejudice isn't part of the equation
for your honor it is not that prejudice
would not be a part of the equation it's
simply that the standard should be lower
um at that application stage the the
most of the applicants
are pro prefer you've gone lower lower
than what specifically
we have provided some um some
language in our brief that is a
potential
um standards that this court could use
for example in
uh the the
certificate of appealabilities in
federal court the standard is a
kind of a probable cause standard and um
essentially the jurists of reason simply
have to be able to conclude that the
issues presented are adequate to deserve
encouragement to proceed further that is
more of a standard that is more of a
workable standard for an applicant who
is is not represented by council
who doesn't have access to the full
record in fact
the rule itself contemplates that the
applicant may not have the record
available to them at the time they're
filing their application
but then what what then prevents an
applicant let's say a pro se
applicant from then raising every
possible
thing or matter that appellate council
did not do
some instance of which might have been
strategic
or had no chance of prevailing how how
do we discern
between those colorable i guess
deficiencies by council versus those
that are not
well your honor those those should be
fared it out
but that should not occur necessarily at
the application stage
if if an issue deserves encouragement to
proceed further
then in that full briefing if there's
strategy issues at play
all of that could come out in the
briefing and at that point the court
does not have to
open re or grant a new um trial or
sentencing phase
because the win here a win for a 26b
application
is simply the ability to file a brief is
that an issue even in front of us
uh your honor issue you're kind of
asking us just to write a kind of
advisory opinion isn't that
know your honor the the issue before
this court with regard to state versus
roger simpson is the proper test for
appellate effectiveness
uh mr simpson's council has we accepted
a
a specific propositional law that deals
with applying the
mates the mapes factors it seems like
uh the party that advocated that
propositional law isn't even arguing and
you're arguing for
something that might be useful but it's
it's certainly not the issue in the case
is it
well actually your honor the appellant
did in fact present in his brief that
although he used the mate factors as his
guard as a guide
that the first stage should apply the
that makes factors in a lower burden
and then during the second fact the
second stage the the maze factors will
be used
um as a whole so even if even if we
presume that the
maze test is the proper test for this
court to adopt
um it is a useful tool it could be a
useful tool for this court
but the reason we we feel that the mace
test is not the appropriate test for
this court is because when you look to
how mape came about the the sixth
circuit created mape's by
reviewing its own history as to what it
found compelling and an ineffective
assistance of council claim
and so they essentially listed out all
these different holdings in which they
found
that to be a compelling reason to
reverse the case
this court has its own precedent this
court has its own reasons that it could
list out
for for reasons for determining
appellate council is effective or not
effective um but regardless of whatever
standard
that is ultimately applied to determine
the issue of appellate effectiveness
there has to be some sort of of
clarification at the very least for the
underlying courts because like the 12th
district did here
the course of appeals are not uh they're
they're combining the two steps
into that that first application inquiry
we see this in the lower court opinion
here and we see it across
the districts in ohio there's cases such
as
state versus schneider and state versus
spain in which the dissenting judges in
both of those cases pointed out
that we have an issue of in these cases
the majority's analysis
is denying the appellant the ability to
develop and expand his legal argument in
that app
at that brief below all of the issues
are being decided
in the application again
most of these applications are pro pay
so we're expecting pro se
inmates to who aren't even advised of
their their right to to
appellate effectiveness of counsel to
then present their own arguments that
appellate counsel missed
to do it within 90 days of the the
filing of the opinion
to attach affidavits and
do this all without access to the record
as a practice when
when we take these cases when we find
these cases um
for the most part or sometimes the
record's not even complete
so we have to spend the time getting the
transcript
we've had attorneys pay out of their own
pocket to have transcripts
have it transcribed in order for the the
applicant to then be represented on
appeal
so what we get then is meritorious
claims are being missed
and one example of that is when you look
at
this course language in state versus
roberts and then you compare it to the
language and state versus golf
so in state versus roberts this court
discussed they highly
highlighted the importance of the right
of allocution in capital cases
and citing state versus green 2000 case
state versus campbell 2000 case
state versus goff the same issue the
right of allocution
was raised but in emirate in a 26c
and no genuine issue was found by the
accord
so the murder hand the application was
rejected
after the sixth circuit after full
briefing and the sixth circuit had the
benefit of full briefing
they reversed the issue and remanded it
back down because there was a genuine
issue
the right to allocution does matter
so you'll also see in our brief when we
cited state versus schleiger
it's another case in which the federal
court had to um
fix what the 12th district didn't do
because the 12th district was applying
the standard before ever having
the briefing in front of it so one of
the proposed standards that we put in
our brief
is simply the definition of colorable
claims and you get that from black
law dictionary and that is a colorable
claim
is one that is legitimate and may
reasonably be asserted given the facts
presented and the current law
or a reasonable and logical extension or
modification of the current law
another that the further extension of
that is that it could be a fair
probability or likelihood but not a
certitude of success on the merits
courts of appeal are requiring
applicants to demonstrate success on the
merits
and again without access to their record
without access to council which doesn't
come until that second phase
they are unable to meet that burden
at this point your honors i would like
to reserve the remainder of my time for
rebuttal unless you all have any
questions
thank you thank you
madam chief justice and may it please
the court
shop security for the attorney general
and in support of the state
this case presents the court with a
dilemma
simpson asked this court to take this
case
so it could consider adopting an
11-factor checklist
for measuring the council's performance
in the context of claims
based on ineffective assistance of
appellate council
simpson claimed that the sixth circuit
which first articulated these factors in
maps versus coil had adopted these
protectors for itself
and that were this court to follow the
six circuits lead
it would harmonize ohio and federal law
and lead to more predictable and stable
outcomes
but it turns out that the sixth circuit
does not in fact
rely on the mape's factors at least not
with any consistency
and it almost never relies on all of
them at one time
but does that does that prevent us from
adopting them
in whole or in part or using them as
as guidance
your honor so i think this is a point of
agreement actually between the public
defender
and our position and that is that we
don't think
that ohio courts should shun their eyes
from the mapes factors we think that
they certainly can look to them
to the extent that they think they are
relevant but we don't think that this
court
should require appellate courts
to apply every single one of these
factors
or any particular number of these
factors every single time
that an appellate court is confronted
with an ineffective assistance of a
pellet council claim
then what is it that you think that a
court of appeals
should do because the assistant public
defender stated that
court of appeals are looking generally
to see
if there is an indication
of success or merit success just from
the applications
in and of themselves on the first
submission
and uniformly denying those before you
can even get to the substance
isn't that missing out on the the
colorable claim
um in in this case right i take for
example the the
the is the facts in this case and the
underlying case
even the issue of of consecutive
sentences here
if my understanding of the facts is we
had a trial court judge who
imposed sentences on three co-defendants
one
five years one eight years and won 51
years
now i understand of course the
difference between
plea bargains and the benefits of that
and getting some some counts
knowledge or deleted but when you come
to consecutive sentences
the trial court looks at the conduct not
the accounts
so you have a trial court judge deciding
that the conduct
of one of three defendants who are
individually
and responsible for their individual
conduct and each other's conduct
that that uh consecutive sentences
totaling 51 years was warranted based on
the conduct of one
but that only five and eight years is
warranted for the conduct of the other
so that there to me raises a colorful
claim that
that the sentence should have been
challenged by a fellow council in this
case
i appreciate the question your honor so
i want to
sort of take that in three parts first
i don't think that this is the case for
this court to announce
any new standards on this issue
and that is first and foremost because
that's
not what this court accepted an appeal
on so
it just has not been adequately briefed
by
the state by simpson himself and even
the public defender
which has briefed this issue more than
any of the other litigants in this case
did not i don't think in either of the
public defenders briefs
actually apply their standard to this
case
so justice stuart everything you said
may be true
but unfortunately we don't have the
benefit of briefing
even from the public defender who is
making this argument
in applying the standard that they
prefer to the facts of this case
second uh i should just note you know
we don't curl too much with the public
defender
on their particular formulation of the
standard
i think they call it a reasonable
likelihood of success
i don't understand that to be saying
anything much different
than what this court has said in its
precedence when it is said
that it looks for a colorful claim or
the language in the rule itself
which includes the term i think genuine
issue all of those
i think basically say the same thing but
i think more
important and this gets to point three
than the particular formulation that
this court settles upon
is recognizing that all of these
standards even at the application stage
are ultimately applying the underlying
strickland standard
therefore
the council performed reasonably and
that the proceedings
were
it's a tall burden for an applicant to
show that
they have made a genuine showing or a
reasonable likelihood
that they were denied effective
appellate counsel are there mistakes
made
in particular cases sure and we don't
deny that but this council said
shouldn't we get to
get to the part two of the 26
uh of the april 26 motion that that
oftentimes we don't even get to that
evaluation
because there isn't clear proof in the
initial application that appellate
council was
ineffective or that the applicant would
have prevailed
on appeal
well your honor i certainly don't think
that we should get to it in this case
and
the public defender again didn't brief
that issue
so i think the most prudent course
honestly is because simpson himself
isn't here
to press his argument about the mape's
factors and because the public
defender hasn't briefed how the standard
that they're pressing
would apply in this case it is for this
i think the most prudent quarters for
this court to just dismiss this case
as in providently accepted but i i
don't think that proceeding to the
second stage
was warranted in this case uh
i i nobody has really developed an
argument
other than simpson for that and simpson
relied on this argument
based on vapes which you know it turns
out based on even a cursory amount of
research
uh isn't isn't borne out in the case of
the sixth circuit doesn't apply those
factors
and he isn't here to clarify his
argument or to explain why this court
should adopt those
factors notwithstanding notwithstanding
that
thank you sure
uh so i would just reiterate that we
think that the proper
course for this court to take is to
dismiss this case
as in providently accepted or in the
alternative
to affirm the judgment of the 12th
district
if there are no further questions for me
your honor
then that is our respectful submission
to you today
i thank you for allowing me to present
the attorney general's case
thank you
thank you um the ohio public defender
does not represent mr simpson so no we
did not
apply our standard to his claims but
that in no way
should render mr simpson's case as
improvingly accepted
to dispute what the attorney general
said if you review
simpson's brief he most certainly did
apply his mape factor the mate factors
to his claims so that point is simply
because amicus council has decided that
that these issues also affect us they
affect a lot of our clients and we felt
that this court might
like to look at it a little differently
but the issue is the same
that whether we're at the application
stage applying the mape factors or for
simply applying strickland versus
washington which is what this core is
determined
is the test and what the us supreme
court has determined is the test
the applicant himself should not be
required to demonstrate prejudice
if you look at the language that that
courts are
are using to determine whether there is
a colorable claim a genuine issue of a
colorful claim is the exact same
language
that is used once an application is
actually granted
and and the cases are reopened the same
prejudice inquiry
an applicant who is pro se again who
does not have access to his own record
and certainly doesn't have the legal
expertise to present his own uh claims
certainly isn't going to be able to make
that showing so this court needs to
clarify for the lower courts
what that standard actually is and if
they need to use the major factors in
determining
how to get to that lower standard then
then
that would suffice as well but this
court needs to make sure that the lower
courts are not holding these pro site
applicants
in 10 pages within 90 days to the same
standard that they are held if they
actually get their applications accepted
if this court has no further questions i
would just write my case all right
thank you thank you thank you better
under advisement you'll be notified of
our decision
marshall will you adjourn court please
ye hear ye hear ye this open session of
the animal supreme court of ohio
now stands adjourned
you
