    "whether",

    "to adopt the shanker line of cases which",
    "held that attorney's fees may be awarded",
    "in a breach of contract case",

    "find bad faith here did they",

    "okay so how did the appellate court deal",

    "concept of bad faith uh it",
    "essentially held that bad faith was not",
    "unnecessary",
    "it was not necessary to be shown because",
    "uh they were going to award visas",
    "damages rather than as",
    "sanctions so it was just merely the",
    "semantics that allowed them to go from",
    "uh you know the the to re-characterize",
    "uh the fees uh that is our position your",
    "honor and i believe that's uh consistent",
    "with this court's precedent",
    "um this court has held in michael's v",
    "morris",
    "in 1956 that litigation cost attorney's",
    "fees constitute",
    "uh litigation costs rather than damages",
    "um in state actual beacon journal it",
    "said morris settles that issue and it",
    "reaffirmed that as recently as christie",

    "uh in gatesby city of toledo california",
    "i'm curious here when i when i look at",

    "why didn't you just argue that uh",

    "terms of the release",
    "uh well you're honored that's true and",
    "it's also true",
    "that when asked if the agreement",
    "uh provided for a loser pays a fee",
    "shifting provision",
    "the apellis in this case specifically",
    "told the trial judge that this",

    "shifting um",
    "so not only does that provide for it but",
    "there was no did you argue though below",

    "uh that under the under the agreement",
    "they",
    "they agreed that they weren't entitled",

    "uh that was not specifically argued",
    "below your honor",
    "why not um i believe",
    "the parties were focused on the american",
    "rule that's what the trial court judge",
    "has specifically framed the issue as",
    "uh and since the american role uh",
    "clearly barred the fees that was the",
    "argument made",
    "and um as chief justice o'connor noted",
    "this is largely a semantic issue in the",
    "united states supreme court",
    "um 224 years ago it rejected the same",
    "effort to re-characterize",
    "attorney's fees and damages and arkham",

    "legislative issue and soar and the board",
    "of education",
    "which recognized that whether to shift",
    "fees is a policy decision",

    "this issue",
    "including an alias the pipeline which",
    "stated that public policy is not a grant",
    "of roving authority to the courts to",

    "in fact this court has held that public",
    "policy supports the enforcement of",
    "contracts in general",
    "in bellevue mcconnell however as noted",
    "earlier the court has consistently held",
    "that",
    "courts cannot award attorneys fees for",
    "breach of contract",
    "what the appellants are doing in this",
    "case is trying to apply",
    "a fee shifting provision into every",
    "settlement at contract because the",
    "contract",
    "that they drafted does not provide for",

    "however this court has stated that it",
    "will not read a fee provision into every",
    "settlement contract or just into",
    "contracts the parties did not agree to",

    "consistent with this court's general",
    "line of cases",
    "saying that the court will reap not",
    "rewrite a contract for the parties",
    "further the contention that a party",
    "should be made whole",
    "for breach of contract is inconsistent",
    "with this court's precedent",
    "this court has long refused to allow a",
    "fee award for breach of contract",
    "and as former justice cook acknowledged",
    "in brandenburg the american rule often",
    "means the party will not be made whole",
    "as the u.s supreme court has stated it",
    "has expressly rejected",
    "the argument as to the american rule in",
    "norfolk the",
    "light belt saying that a party can't",
    "court can't award fees to recover to a",
    "recovery to make a party truly whole",
    "under the american rule in fact the",
    "appellates haven't cited a single case",
    "where fees were awarded just to make a",
    "party hole for breach of contract",
    "they instead rely upon cases where one",
    "party sucks or contractually agreed to",
    "pay the fees of another",
    "our court's awarding fees as",
    "compensatory damages for breach of",
    "contract",

    "damages",
    "by filing a motion emotion is",
    "fundamentally different than a breach of",

    "and further the breach of contract a",
    "breach of contract requires proving four",
    "elements",
    "that a contract was formed that the",
    "movement performed under the contract",
    "that the opposing party breached and",
    "that the movement suffered damages as a",
    "result",

    "it's the equivalent of a declaratory",

    "appellates",

    "the breach of contract and the amount of",

    "issues in christmas mortgage this court",

    "hearing only",
    "reiko is entitled to a jury trial on",
    "both the issue of breach of contract and",
    "damages",
    "however if the hearing on the trial uh",
    "the hearing was the trial on breach of",
    "contract then damages was a necessary",
    "element of proof",
    "in that trial employees however did not",

    "trial",

    "trial on the issue of breach because",

    "certainly the the intent and that's why",

    "this below it was not a focus on the",
    "american rule",
    "it was not argued because the parties",
    "intended",
    "by their wording to release all claims",
    "including attorney fees relating to the",
    "legal malpractice",
    "claim below certainly nobody",
    "contemplated",

    "that this would be this language would",
    "be used",
    "to release a claim for attorney fees",
    "appellants your honor took the position",
    "that there was no settlement contract",
    "there was no settlement contract and",
    "therefore there was no release language",
    "in there",
    "only when we proved there was a",
    "settlement contract",
    "where are we then allowed our expectancy",
    "interest",
    "or the benefit of the bargain and that",
    "is the legal fees incurred",
    "to enforce that contract that release",
    "what i don't i guess leaving aside",
    "that language for a second uh back to",
    "the main thrust of your argument",
    "i'm having a hard time understanding how",
    "damages here are different than in any",
    "other contract",
    "where i mean to make someone whole",
    "you're if you really want to make",
    "someone whole you'd have to compensate",
    "them",
    "for the legal fees that",
    "they encourage to get the benefit of the",
    "bargain",
    "why is this any different there this is",
    "very distinguishable",
    "from uh other contracts for example",
    "in a contract for the sale of goods in a",
    "contract for goods",
    "the core benefit of that bargain is the",
    "delivery of the goods",
    "at the agreed to price later legal fees",
    "spent",
    "to enforce the",
    "the contract in the event of a breach",
    "are incidental to the core benefit",
    "of the delivery of those goods at the",
    "agreed price",
    "any expenditure of legal fees on a",
    "breach of contract claim",
    "later are incidental to that core",
    "benefit",
    "and that is why so many appellate courts",
    "who have looked at this",
    "have made the distinct the distinction",
    "where the spend of legal fees is",
    "incidental to the contract",
    "so what what's the line here i mean you",
    "know",
    "all the time people enter into",
    "agreements",
    "because they would like to avoid",
    "litigation",
    "uh is is it anytime there's a there's an",
    "agreement where litigation is a",
    "possibility",
    "does it have to be after litigation has",
    "been commenced",
    "it's not simply where it's a possibility",
    "again",
    "when parties contract uh",
    "for the purchase of goods or",
    "the purchase of our project all kinds of",
    "other contracts where there may not be a",
    "lawsuit filed but",
    "one of the there may be this i mean i",
    "may uh",
    "uh i may sell i may",
    "sell my house there may be a defect",
    "defect that's not disclosed",
    "uh i may settle with with the buyer",
    "because",
    "i don't i don't want to get sued uh",
    "am i entitled to attorney attorney fees",
    "appropriate in that case in that case",
    "in that there was a breach of that",
    "agreement in that case",
    "the parties are negotiating to eliminate",
    "the risk",
    "of liability for the sale of that house",
    "they are negotiating to eliminate the",
    "risk of litigation",
    "and part of the thinking for any party",
    "so",
    "so so do you get attorneys feature for",
    "each of that or not well",
    "yes or no yes yes your honor because",
    "part of the benefit of that bargain is i",
    "don't want to go into court",
    "i don't want to have to but it is isn't",
    "isn't that part of the benefit of all",
    "kinds of bargains out there",
    "i mean it could be the incidental",
    "benefit",
    "of the contract for the sale of goods i",
    "mean if i'm",
    "if i'm in a motor vehicle accident and i",
    "settle",
    "i sell that claim presumably one of the",
    "reasons i",
    "settle is because i don't want to be",
    "sued that's exactly right and in that",
    "case",
    "as the insured for instance in that case",
    "we have many settlements",
    "in ohio involving involving accident",
    "cases of course",
    "and the insured will use insurance",
    "proceeds",
    "to pay the uh",
    "the other side the non-negligent party",
    "and that non-negligent party says in",
    "that contract listen",
    "if you pay me consideration if you pay",
    "me your insurance proceeds",
    "i will stop my lawsuit or i will not",
    "bring my lawsuit",
    "and you will not have to pay legal fees",
    "so so is the rule any time",
    "in agreements includes",
    "includes a release of a potential claim",
    "that you're entitled to attorney's fees",
    "the american rule doesn't apply",
    "any time the benefit of the bargain",
    "is is the avoidance of legal fees",
    "so we're talking so we're talking about",
    "a really really broad extension",
    "this isn't just this isn't just about",
    "litigation going on in court this is",
    "about",
    "anytime there could be litigation um if",
    "parties pre-suit settle a tort case",
    "they want to stay out of court that's",
    "expressly the benefit of their bargain",
    "and they should be entitled",
    "so so that that means pretty much any",
    "time when there's",
    "something that could be a torque anytime",
    "the parties settle anytime the parties",
    "settle a dispute or they manage the risk",
    "of liability and want to pay",
    "or accept compensation to stay out of",
    "court",
    "if they are deprived of the legal fees",
    "that they incur",
    "so what what if one of two businesses",
    "have have a have a good fit have a",
    "dispute they both think that they both",
    "think they're right",
    "one ultimately says you know what it's",
    "cheaper just to settle this so",
    "then you're entitled you're entitled to",
    "attorney's visa in that instance if",
    "there's a breach",
    "absolutely yes because that is the",
    "benefit of that bargain",
    "that the hypothetical presents justice",
    "that party is expressly saying i may not",
    "be liable here",
    "but i don't know",
    "that outlaw in ohio the american rule",
    "our position is consistent with the",
    "american rule",
    "it does not violate it it does not",
    "require an exception",
    "to it the american rule would apply in",
    "the sale of a goods",
    "where let me give you an example",
    "okay an oral contract in ohio you have a",
    "right to breach a contract",
    "as long as you're willing to pay the",
    "damages",
    "okay yes but you sue under the oral",
    "contract",
    "there's no basis to get attorneys fees",
    "that that is correct to the extent the",
    "oral contract",
    "is has a benefit of the bargain where",
    "the payment of legal fees to enforce is",
    "simply",
    "incidental as in the sale of a goods but",
    "if that oral contract",
    "justice if in that oral contract",
    "i say if you pay me compensation",
    "i will take measures so you don't have",
    "to spend legal fees",
    "in court and i breached that oral",
    "agreement",
    "the other side ought to be entitled to",
    "that benefit of the bargain",
    "that's that's the word ought that's i",
    "hear you i'm just saying",
    "what is the current law in ohio is not",
    "the american rule",
    "precluding the recovery of attorneys",
    "fees in those cases",
    "today in the sale of a goods in the sale",
    "of goods it prevents it",
    "but where the parties have an express",
    "benefit of the bargain",
    "it does not prevent it because in this",
    "court's",
    "decisions when an insurance company",
    "breaches a duty to defend",
    "an insured this court has always held",
    "that the insured can sue",
    "the insurance company for breach of that",
    "duty to defend",
    "and recover the legal fees spent",
    "defending itself",
    "and that includes the legal fees spent",
    "in bringing the lawsuit against the",
    "insurance company",
    "and the reason is because that is the",
    "specific",
    "benefit of the bargain that was negate",
    "negotiated for",
    "and if we deprive that party of the",
    "benefit of its bargain",
    "its expectancy interest they are",
    "deprived of contractual damages",
    "there is no contractual reason no basis",
    "in contract",
    "that says a party who has an expectancy",
    "damage",
    "or a benefit of the bargain based on",
    "legal fees",
    "should be deprived them simply because",
    "they happen to be legal fees",
    "it is the appellants who are misapplying",
    "the american rule",
    "to deprive a party of its benefit of its",
    "bargain its express",
    "benefit of its bargain its expectancy",
    "interest and this court allows the",
    "recovery",
    "of legal fees in a suit against an",
    "insurance company",
    "for for each of the duty to defend",
    "because it's the expectancy interest",
    "that was negotiated and it was council",
    "if if a party has a colorable defense",
    "that a contractor has even formed in a",
    "settlement agreement shouldn't they be",
    "able to defend that",
    "without the fear that they're going to",
    "incur",
    "legal fees absent bad faith",
    "well individuals or entities",
    "always may have a belief that a contract",
    "uh was not formed and they can lose that",
    "piece of litigation and they still are",
    "bound by that contract in this case",
    "the contract they told us justice",
    "if you enter into this contract if you",
    "promise to pay this amount",
    "you will not have to incur future legal",
    "fees",
    "the police should be entitled to that",
    "expectancy interest",
    "as a matter of pure contract damages",
    "mr vargo if i could ask a question",
    "this can all be avoided in the",
    "settlement agreements can it not",
    "if the parties agree the winner will",
    "you know if this settlement is breached",
    "or argued loser pays the fees",
    "or they can agree otherwise why should",
    "we leave it",
    "open to question like this when within",
    "the american rule you already have a way",
    "that the parties with good lawyers can",
    "protect against that",
    "thank you for that question uh judge",
    "the the the separate fee shifting clause",
    "is unnecessary in this case",
    "because the party sat down and expressly",
    "contracted",
    "so they would not have to pay legal fees",
    "it is an express expectancy interest",
    "in no other contract do we require",
    "parties",
    "to set forth their expectancy interest",
    "before they're entitled to recovery",
    "if a seller fails to deliver goods the",
    "buyer can sue the seller",
    "for the higher price the buyer is forced",
    "to pay elsewhere",
    "less the agreed to price that buyer does",
    "not have to set that expectancy interest",
    "in its contract in order to sue for it",
    "it's able to sue for it under basic",
    "contract law",
    "here the parties expressly contracted",
    "for this expectancy to require",
    "a second to require another fee shifting",
    "clause",
    "is unnecessary in essence this was a",
    "10-page agreement",
    "to shift the fees both parties knew",
    "their they would be liable for the",
    "expectancy interest",
    "suffered by the other party and both",
    "parties knew that expectancy interest",
    "was to stay out of court and to avoid",
    "legal fees",
    "now one argument and",
    "i'll glad to take any other questions",
    "and i know i'm running out of time but",
    "the the other side argues that this will",
    "lead to",
    "claims for immaterial breaches that's",
    "not true",
    "the remand order says that only",
    "reasonable attorney fees will be awarded",
    "so",
    "if somebody brings a motion or",

    "those will not be reasonable thank you",
    "thank you council oh thank you your",
    "honor uh for all those reasons we",
    "respectfully requested the appellate",
    "court be affirmed thank you very much",
    "mr lykins you have about two and a half",
    "minutes left",
    "thank you your honor i'd like to begin",
    "with the uh statement that",
    "mr vargo made that as to what we told",
    "them",
    "i'd like to focus on what they told the",
    "trial court the trial court specifically",
    "asked them did you agree that if a",
    "motion had",
    "to enforce had to be brought that the",
    "loser would pay the other side's",
    "attorney's fees",
    "they responded to that question up to",
    "the trial court with",
    "we did not agree that's on page 409 of",
    "the joint supplement",
    "having told the trial court that this",
    "was not part of the agreement",
    "the argument that is being made that",
    "this was really the benefit of the",
    "bargain and something that the parties",
    "agreed to",
    "is clearly was not an intended part of",
    "the contract if the council agreed",
    "that expressly wouldn't expressly ask",
    "that question that that was not part of",
    "the agreement",
    "as far as the benefit of the bargain",
    "this was a",
    "25 million dollar claim as identified by",
    "the apellis themselves in the",
    "um trial on the underlying litigation",
    "they were able to settle that for three",
    "or three million",
    "um which is approximately 12 of what",
    "potential claim against them was that is",
    "the benefit of the bargain",
    "as the first circuit held when",
    "considering the shanker line of cases",
    "that they're relying upon",
    "you have to look to the contract to",
    "determine what the benefit of the",
    "bargain is",
    "the court uh this courts of this state",
    "have repeatedly held that as well",
    "even in insurance contracts as mr vargo",
    "is referring to",
    "you look to see what it is the insurance",
    "company agreed to do",
    "if there's no agreement to defend in the",
    "insurance contract the courts don't",
    "imply an agreement to defend they've",
    "said we look at it we determine what it",
    "is and then we enforce it",
    "getting your fees for enforcing a",
    "contract",
    "is not part of the benefit of the",
    "bargain unless you specifically agreed",
    "to that",
    "finally i'd like to address one other",
    "issue",

    "formed and what the terms of that",

    "determination that the contract was",

    "who filed in the amicus brief",

    "if necessary",
    "the language of 45 1133 and the",
    "definitions found in 45 1101",
    "dictionary definitions and case law",
    "throughout the state of ohio",
    "all support turner's propositional law",
    "that a murderous who touches but does",
    "not cross the lane line does not violate",
    "section 45 1133",
    "and does not give an officer reasonable",
    "architectural suspicion for a stop",
    "if however the court finds that 45 1133",
    "is ambiguous",
    "the rule of leninity codified in 290104a",
    "requires that the statute be construed",
    "strictly against the state",
    "and liberally in favor of turner which",
    "mandates a finding that touching a line",
    "is not a violation of 45 11 33",
    "a motorist remains in their lane when",
    "they touch the lane line as the",
    "definitions",
    "and 45 1101 for roadway and lane highway",
    "made clear that the lane lines are part",
    "of the lane and can be driven on",
    "the legislature specifically excluded",
    "the berm and the shoulder",
    "from the roadway used for vehicular",
    "travel but did not exclude land lines",
    "since the line can be traveled on it is",
    "the outside edge of the line that marks",
    "the outside edge of the lane",
    "the 12th majority in the state attempt",
    "to establish the inside",
    "edge of the line as the outside edge of",
    "the lane by applying",
    "outside definitions to the phrase",
    "entirely within which is found in 45",
    "11 33 but this position is problematic",
    "for two reasons",
    "first defining within as they do as",
    "on the inside or on the inner side is",
    "actually consistent with turner's",
    "position",
    "a motorist traveling on the lane line is",
    "still driving on the inside",
    "or on the inner side of the outside edge",
    "of the lane line and thus is in the lane",
    "second this is a cherry pick definition",
    "anyways",
    "within is also defined as for one",
    "example not beyond",
    "which certainly suggests that you can",
    "travel on the line but cannot cross",
    "beyond the line",
    "so the statutory definition supports",
    "turner's position the dictionary",
    "definitions support turner's position",
    "other statutes like 45 11 25 and 45 1136",
    "show the legislature's intent to allow",
    "touching",
    "every appellate court outside of the",
    "12th district supports",
    "turner's position even the 12th decision",
    "was a split decision",
    "finally the the amicus and the state",
    "argue reasonable mistake of law",
    "on the basis that the statute is",
    "ambiguous uh thus they are admitting",
    "that 45 1133 does not clearly support",
    "their position",
    "thus i believe that it cannot be said",
    "that the language of 45 1133",
    "clearly and unambiguously supports the",
    "state's position",
    "so that leaves us with two options first",
    "either the statute clearly supports",
    "turner's position which it does",
    "and which is what appellate courts",
    "outside the 12th have unanimously held",
    "or the statute must be deemed ambiguous",
    "and again based on 290104",
    "they must be construed strictly against",
    "the state and liberally in favor of",
    "the accused mr turner and the only way",
    "to do that would be to find that",
    "motorists are allowed to touch the lane",
    "lines",
    "finally concerns about safety from the",
    "12th",
    "and from the state just do not withstand",
    "scrutiny",
    "first appellate courts have expressly",
    "allowed touching lane lines for up to 23",
    "years in various districts throughout",
    "the state of ohio",
    "and there is no evidence that accidents",
    "have increased a review of statewide",
    "crash data does not support these safety",
    "concerns",
    "second these theoretical safety concerns",
    "that are proposed by the 12th and by the",
    "state",
    "falling below deciding to start ramming",
    "their vehicles into",
    "their vehicles yes sir",
    "uh so as i understand it",
    "under your reading the",
    "uh the strips the the lane lines are",
    "are really in both lanes",
    "right i i believe that the",
    "lane line can be touched and the",
    "but answer answer my question i'm just",
    "trying to figure out what lane they're",
    "in",
    "so in your view the painted strip",
    "would be in the center line for example",
    "would be in",
    "both of the lanes right so",
    "motorists in each lane could touch that",
    "lane line that's that's correct",
    "because and because because the entire",
    "strip until they until the outer edge",
    "would be within their lane for both",
    "people so yeah",
    "that's correct you have this kind of no",
    "man's land that's in",
    "in both lanes right correct",
    "and but",
    "if that's the case then how is the",
    "language",
    "that says you you have to drive entirely",
    "within",
    "one lane makes sense because under your",
    "reading if you",
    "if you can go in the paint you're in",
    "both lanes",
    "right so so you're not currently within",
    "one line you're in two-way you'd be in",
    "two lanes",
    "right what i would say is this first",
    "obviously that doesn't apply to the fog",
    "lines in my opinion which is what this",
    "case",
    "but it's to say it's the same definition",
    "for both i mean it's the same",
    "prohibition so we have to we have to",
    "think it means the same thing for",
    "for both the center lanes and the fog",
    "lines so here is what i would say",
    "um think about airline seats so you have",
    "a seat armrest seat and if you put your",
    "arm on the armrest you're not now",
    "occupying two seats",
    "you know an employee of the airline is",
    "not going to rush back and come and",
    "charge you an extra 400",
    "for another ticket because you're now",
    "using two seats but",
    "if your hand drifts across the armrest",
    "all the way across",
    "into the other person's seat now you",
    "have some explaining to do now you have",
    "an issue",
    "so i think that when you read 45 11 33",
    "you have to do it with an understanding",
    "of",
    "the definitions in 45 1101 which as i",
    "laid out in my brief make clear that the",
    "lane lines are part of the lane",
    "part of the roadway usually",
    "how safe is it if you're gonna say the",
    "center line",
    "is uh uh it's permissible",
    "for cars to be driving uh both north and",
    "south",
    "or east and west in",
    "opposite directions and occupy",
    "the center line right so i don't believe",
    "that it creates any safety concerns",
    "first of all like i mentioned this has",
    "been allowed",
    "in districts for at least up to 23 years",
    "in certain districts obviously less than",
    "others based on when the appellate",
    "decisions were made",
    "and we haven't seen any proof of any",
    "increase in crashes and",
    "accident reports does not show that",
    "there's been an increase second the",
    "center lines are already allowed to be",
    "driven on",
    "under uh statute section 45 11-25",
    "and again we haven't seen any issues",
    "with that the legislature could",
    "obviously address that if they thought",
    "that there was",
    "third just because two motorists have",
    "the ability to occupy potentially",
    "the same space doesn't mean that they",
    "can at the same time",
    "if if i am driving on the line and",
    "somebody",
    "another guy counsel who has the",
    "right-of-way in your",
    "example if you're approaching",
    "uh one car approaching another",
    "uh they happen to be just inside",
    "the center line not over it",
    "right um who has the right of way so the",
    "the person who's touching the line if",
    "there is one",
    "there's two cars they're both positioned",
    "on the same",
    "line right so",
    "the end of the motorists wouldn't be",
    "able to just ram into one another",
    "frankly they they still would have the",
    "duty to avoid any types of accidents",
    "just like they do now",
    "and if one did ram their vehicle into",
    "one another and the police decided who",
    "was at fault there there's a number of",
    "criminal and traffic statutes that would",
    "uh",
    "prevent that situation from occurring or",
    "hold a party responsible well how could",
    "you how could you tell which one was",
    "liable if they both had a right to be",
    "there",
    "well they have a right to be there if",
    "nobody else is there",
    "it's sort of the same as if you're",
    "driving one car in front of the other",
    "and then say motorist a is in front",
    "motorist b is behind",
    "motors b technically under the statute",
    "has a right to use the lane that is in",
    "front of him but he doesn't have the",
    "right to",
    "uh you know ram into the back of",
    "motorists and there's assured clear",
    "distance rules there",
    "but right now assured clear distance",
    "under your suggestion",
    "that the center line belongs to both",
    "lanes therefore belongs to both vehicles",
    "uh and um i just don't understand how",
    "you could",
    "uh find fault if so if there's a",
    "collision",
    "well i i would say that the",
    "the same way you would in any other type",
    "of accident",
    "um you would have to decide who was",
    "there",
    "who was allowed to be there and who",
    "moved his vehicle well how do you do",
    "that",
    "that's what i'm asking you how do you do",
    "that under your",
    "uh um you know your scenario",
    "the same way you would determine fault",
    "in any other accident i suppose",
    "you know aob witnesses uh",
    "the people's reports what uh uh",
    "the police officers found through their",
    "investigation i suppose",
    "um but that's already allowed in 45 11",
    "25",
    "again and if we're going to read that",
    "consistent with 45",
    "11 33 then we would have to suggest that",
    "45 11 33 also allows",
    "uh driving on the line",
    "i i don't see that it's as a an issue",
    "that hasn't already been dealt with for",
    "the past 33 years the other concern with",
    "a center line is",
    "typically center lines are double",
    "yellows i suppose the court would be",
    "within their right to",
    "say one motorist can touch one and one",
    "murders can touch the other i don't",
    "think that's the",
    "question presented here so that's not",
    "something that's been delved into",
    "but obviously the court or the",
    "legislature could decide that as well",
    "your honors uh my plan now would be to",
    "hand it over to mr grube if you have any",
    "constitutional related issues but before",
    "i would do that",
    "i would be happy to answer any other",
    "questions that you have about the facts",
    "of the case the record of the case or",
    "anything else contained in our briefs",
    "okay thank you mr group uh how long are",
    "you taking two minutes did i hear",
    "uh yes your honor good morning chief",
    "justice o'connor associate justices",
    "may please the court lewis grube here on",
    "behalf of the",
    "ohio association of criminal defense",
    "lawyers",
    "um we've raised a number of reasons why",
    "this court could simply decline to",
    "answer",
    "the constitutional issue in the first",
    "instance",
    "in our brief we've also provided an",
    "analysis that we think the court",
    "could use in order to determine that the",
    "ohio constitution provides more",
    "protection in this area and that",
    "a reasonable mistake of law does not",
    "render a stop",
    "reasonable if there was no violation of",
    "law",
    "but i think my time is best spent this",
    "morning getting out in front of the",
    "case bowling green v godwin which was",
    "provided by",
    "the ohio attorney general amicus",
    "they make the claim that this is a case",
    "that was already decided by this court",
    "that already opened up the can of worms",
    "for a reasonable mistake of law",
    "and i just i need to get it across that",
    "that was not a mistake of law case that",
    "was simply",
    "a mistake of fact case there was no",
    "question",
    "in that case that it was illegal if you",
    "failed to observe a traffic control",
    "device",
    "that would prime under the bowling green",
    "code the issue in the case was whether",
    "there were six",
    "specific signs in one municipal lot",
    "the question was whether those specific",
    "signs were traffic control devices",
    "there was a statute that required the",
    "city council to actually validate these",
    "these signs",
    "um and more to the point this court",
    "treated it as a mistake of fact case not",
    "a mistake of law case",
    "so uh there was none of the analysis",
    "that you would have expected if you look",
    "at",
    "the high-end case out of the united",
    "states supreme court none of that",
    "sort of analysis was provided by the",
    "court the court uh",
    "determined that prob or explain probable",
    "cause is determined by examining the",
    "historical facts that said paragraph 14",
    "and then determined at paragraph 18",
    "in view of all the facts available to",
    "the officer at the time of the stop",
    "there was probable cause",
    "so i would just simply ask the court not",
    "to treat that as a mistake of law",
    "case and with that i'd conclude i'm",
    "happy to answer any questions",
    "in your honor if there are no questions",
    "i'd like to save the remaining 2 minutes",
    "and 55 seconds for rebuttal",
    "all right",
    "council",
    "is it mr horton going first yes your",
    "honor",
    "okay thank you madam chief justice",
    "justices may please the court my name is",
    "nick horton and i represent the state of",
    "ohio and i will be sharing time",
    "with the attorney general's office uh",
    "your honors this case is about",
    "determining the plain language or giving",
    "meaning to the plain language used by",
    "the general assembly in 45 1133",
    "in particular the phrase entirely within",
    "a single lane",
    "the 12th district determined that the",
    "phrase meant",
    "the vehicle must be driven completely on",
    "the inner side",
    "of the marked lane lines so as not to",
    "touch the mark lane lines",
    "and this court should affirm as such a",
    "decision is uh most closely aligned",
    "with the plain language and the intent",
    "of the statute so there are two ways of",
    "interpreting uh the individual lines",
    "themselves",
    "and that is either as uh part of the",
    "lane",
    "or as sort of a neutral zone or buffer",
    "zone uh",
    "now the the plain language of the",
    "statute and the purpose for the statute",
    "indicate that the lines are the",
    "buffer zones or neutral zones rather",
    "than part of the lanes themselves",
    "so the purpose behind the the lines is",
    "to prevent uh cars from inadvertently",
    "traveling",
    "uh within uh the the path of another",
    "vehicle",
    "or inadvertently traveling on the side",
    "of the road uh",
    "potentially into another vehicle",
    "pedestrian or or",
    "object in other words it",
    "prevents cars from inadvertently trying",
    "to share the same space",
    "so by by construing uh the line as part",
    "of the lane itself",
    "um it would be inconsistent uh to say",
    "that uh it's inconsistent with the",
    "purpose",
    "uh to prevent this inadvertent sharing",
    "of the same space",
    "by saying but cars can share the same",
    "space",
    "on the on the lines themselves council",
    "council",
    "when a lane is being measured the width",
    "of a lane uh is the line",
    "included or not included so there is no",
    "indication",
    "in the omu tcd uh or the",
    "ohio uh roadway design manual um",
    "the the only case that addressed it that",
    "i could find",
    "was the the hatfield case um which",
    "indicated that the the lines were not",
    "part of the lanes",
    "because as the court noted the addition",
    "of the",
    "the end lines or the edge lines and the",
    "center",
    "or the center double yellow lines would",
    "reduce the",
    "the overall width of the lane um",
    "and the language itself indicates that",
    "the the lines cannot be part of the",
    "lanes because if both cars",
    "can touch the center dash line",
    "then by traveling on the center dash",
    "line you are traveling",
    "uh on both the right lane and the left",
    "lane",
    "you cannot possibly be traveling",
    "entirely within a single lane",
    "it counts in this case it's the fog line",
    "okay could you address that",
    "sure so the alliance can't really be",
    "treated any differently for a couple",
    "reasons",
    "first is uh safety it safety is no less",
    "an issue",
    "on the edge line than on the center dash",
    "line",
    "because uh with the center dash line",
    "you're dealing with",
    "moving vehicles and it's it's easier to",
    "for a",
    "moving vehicle to get out of the way of",
    "a car that's encroaching on its",
    "territory um",
    "rather than uh perhaps on the side of",
    "the road where",
    "you may have a broken down vehicle or a",
    "stopped vehicle",
    "or this is uh usually where officers",
    "pull over",
    "uh motorists for a a traffic violation",
    "um and if we don't have enough space on",
    "the side",
    "then you're close to pedestrians and",
    "street signs and telephone poles",
    "uh all of which uh would have a much",
    "tougher time",
    "of getting out of the way of a moving",
    "vehicle encroaching on their",
    "their uh area um and so",
    "i think the safety concerns are even",
    "more prevalent uh on the edge line",
    "so we can't really treat it differently",
    "than",
    "the uh the center line i think this is",
    "supported by the omu tcd as well",
    "because the center dashed lines are",
    "allowed to be crossed whereas",
    "the white edge line is supposed to",
    "discourage all crossing",
    "and it wouldn't make sense to say that a",
    "motorist could not",
    "touch the center dash line the very line",
    "it's allowed to cross",
    "but is not is allowed to touch and ride",
    "on",
    "the uh the edge line which is",
    "discouraged from crossing",
    "additionally there is no differentiation",
    "in 45 11 33 between the",
    "center dash line and the white edge line",
    "and therefore we would be",
    "reading in a differentiation that that",
    "is not necessarily present in the in the",
    "statute except mr horton",
    "i just want to ask this sure the dash",
    "line represents a permissive",
    "condition where cars may pass safely",
    "and a violation of that causing an",
    "accident",
    "may be something else because it's a",
    "permission condition so",
    "that's not really represented here but",
    "when you get",
    "to the omt cd",
    "and you actually read section",
    "3a06 it says that the solid line",
    "discourages or prohibits crossing",
    "it doesn't say the entire entity",
    "inside that line so can you explain this",
    "why why the manual would say",
    "it prohibits or discourages crossing",
    "not on an inside edge sure so um",
    "the the manual actually can't be used to",
    "define what is or is not a marked lanes",
    "violation",
    "because according to the manual uh",
    "crossing the center dash lines",
    "or even crossing that white edge line",
    "would not be a violation",
    "the only violation we would have is if",
    "there was a",
    "a crossing of the solid double yellow",
    "line or solid",
    "double white line in fact when the solid",
    "white line",
    "is used as an edge line",
    "then it only discourages but does not",
    "prohibit",
    "crossing uh so uh so under",
    "that impart knowledge as to what",
    "actually the lane is",
    "isn't that the whole purpose of this",
    "manual",
    "and all of the provisions and the",
    "markings that go into our roadway",
    "isn't that really defining the space",
    "where cars have to stop",
    "or operate within i mean",
    "this manual was created pursuant to",
    "the the federal highway administration",
    "system",
    "and is really across the united states",
    "uniform so that these lines all mean the",
    "same thing whether you're in ohio or",
    "florida or california or texas",
    "so as it's instructive on what a lane is",
    "for all drivers you still don't believe",
    "it has any validity in defining that",
    "not as far as uh defining the",
    "what constitutes part of the lane and",
    "what does not",
    "um so it never",
    "specifically says what uh",
    "what lane markings are part of the lane",
    "and what are not um",
    "and and it can't inform 45 1133",
    "because under the omu tcd crossing those",
    "lines would not be a violation",
    "um it would be i think somewhat similar",
    "to",
    "the situation in in dibbler that this",
    "court handled",
    "um and so the the",
    "most uh appropriate uh use of this line",
    "is to create",
    "is to treat it like a uh a buffer zone",
    "or uh",
    "or a neutral zone uh which would create",
    "the space between the",
    "the uh the vehicles or the vehicle and",
    "whatever is on the",
    "side of the road and that's it's",
    "supported by the omu tcd that the inside",
    "edge of the line",
    "uh is the uh the",
    "the line uh the edge of the uh",
    "individual lane uh and the orc um",
    "so where do i find that then in the omt",
    "cd that the it's the inside edge so",
    "what it indicates is that the white line",
    "may be substituted",
    "for uh for curves or",
    "uh parking and clearly it is the inside",
    "edge",
    "of the curb or inside edge of the the",
    "cars",
    "that delineate the outside edge of the",
    "of the lane therefore it stands to",
    "reason that",
    "if those can substitute for the white",
    "line",
    "it would also be the inside edge of the",
    "white line",
    "that constitutes the outside edge of the",
    "of the line now it could be said that",
    "writing on the line",
    "is uh is within a single lane because",
    "you have not yet breached",
    "into the adjacent area the problem with",
    "that",
    "is that we wouldn't be giving effects to",
    "the word entirely",
    "so uh driving on the line cannot be both",
    "uh driving within the lane and entirely",
    "within the lane",
    "because then we're not giving effect to",
    "the word entirely and we're effectively",
    "reading it out of the statute which we",
    "we cannot do",
    "immediately before the word entirely we",
    "have the words as",
    "nearly as is practicable so how do you",
    "doesn't that",
    "in some way modify the word entirely",
    "no your honor only as a defense as this",
    "court noted in state versus maze",
    "and i think that i think is the issue",
    "with the third district cases that",
    "the defendant brings up is that those",
    "cases focused on practicability and",
    "safety which this court",
    "said uh are not really considerations",
    "when we're talking about uh reasonable",
    "suspicion",
    "um i see my time is getting short and i",
    "want to make sure the",
    "attorney general's office has some time",
    "to address",
    "any issues so we would ask the score to",
    "affirm",
    "uh and if there are no further questions",
    "thank you mr kearney good morning madam",
    "chief justice may please the court",
    "we're here today for two reasons first",
    "to echo",
    "the state that driving on the line is a",
    "violation of the statute",
    "and second to urge that even if it's not",
    "this stop was still reasonable because",
    "the officer made a reasonable mistake",
    "about the law i'd like to quickly",
    "address if i may the lendity point my",
    "friend on the other side raised",
    "the godwin point um and also the manual",
    "point that justice kennedy was asking",
    "about",
    "um as salinity it doesn't apply here",
    "because not only is that the last resort",
    "if you have ambiguity and we think here",
    "the text resolves it about entirely",
    "but also leonidy is about giving the",
    "defendant a break on a conviction",
    "leonidy does not apply when we're",
    "talking here about whether the violation",
    "serves as reasonable suspicion",
    "and in fact that's what segues into the",
    "godwin point",
    "where this court has already said that a",
    "reasonable mistake",
    "does justify a stop as to godwin",
    "um what this court said um was that",
    "the officer on this on the ground or on",
    "the road",
    "trying to enforce law is not like",
    "someone taking a bar",
    "exam so i think that pretty clearly says",
    "they were talking about mistakes of law",
    "they even talked about the officer's",
    "understanding of the law",
    "so calling it a factual case because of",
    "the stop signs",
    "not being valid i don't think works that",
    "and i don't think there's a difference",
    "in reasonableness between a factual",
    "mistake",
    "and a legal mistake um as the heim case",
    "talks about",
    "but again this um this court already",
    "said so in god when",
    "there's no case being made to overrule",
    "it briefly about",
    "the manual and about the",
    "as nearly as practical language if i can",
    "squeeze that into",
    "um one thing the manual does say",
    "in section 3a.05.02",
    "is that it's to delineate quote the",
    "separation of traffic the key word there",
    "i think",
    "is separation and of course as we talked",
    "about with the entirely language",
    "if you have a shared space you're not",
    "separating",
    "if you have a buffer zone where you're",
    "keeping",
    "over here and over here then you are",
    "separating traffic if you're inviting",
    "them to both be on the same space",
    "that's not separating traffic that's",
    "inviting disaster",
    "um further uh to address something my",
    "friend on the other side said",
    "that notion about shared space doesn't",
    "turn on whether someone is",
    "actually going to insist on their rights",
    "and scrape right up against somebody um",
    "no it shows conceptually that it can't",
    "be shared",
    "after all if someone comes three feet",
    "over the line i'm also going to get the",
    "heck out of the way too",
    "if i'm coming the other direction that",
    "doesn't mean they should be there",
    "it just means we all drive defensively",
    "yes when you ask when you make a",
    "statement about",
    "3805 that really talks about the",
    "delineation of",
    "colors and why we use certain colors",
    "on a roadway to demar certain",
    "areas as passable or prohibited",
    "but it's really the functionality isn't",
    "it of the longitudinal line",
    "when you get to three a06",
    "where again it says the general function",
    "and as it relates to the solid white",
    "line",
    "the fog line it discourages or prohibits",
    "the crossing",
    "doesn't that really lead me to the",
    "conclusion that the lane",
    "includes the line and it isn't until you",
    "cross it",
    "know your honor um for a couple of",
    "reasons uh",
    "first in discouraging crossing and this",
    "actually",
    "ties in with um and matches the language",
    "about as soon or as nearly as",
    "practicable",
    "is that there's a difference between",
    "saying look we want to give drivers some",
    "wiggle room to cross",
    "for deliberate safety reasons and the",
    "court talked about this in maze where",
    "they said",
    "look if you need to avoid something you",
    "know whether you need to avoid a live",
    "deer",
    "a dead deer a john deere whatever's in",
    "the road",
    "sure you can cross or if you need to",
    "just make a turn you can do so but",
    "that's when you do so deliberately",
    "what the court in may said is that that",
    "language doesn't allow",
    "you to do so for mere inattentiveness",
    "or carelessness or in this case",
    "drunkenness um",
    "and so that delineation is saying hey",
    "here's where you're be careful",
    "if you need to cross sure look both ways",
    "make sure you can",
    "but the the allowance we give is for",
    "deliberate and if you're moving",
    "deliberately",
    "well then you're not only allowed to",
    "touch you're allowed to outright cross",
    "when it's warranted by the facts but we",
    "don't allow free drifting to just",
    "keep on touching whether once or 100",
    "times just like we don't allow",
    "crossing because again the line has to",
    "be",
    "conceptually between the spaces or",
    "between the allowable spaces not",
    "a shared space where everyone can go",
    "um that's simply the matter of the text",
    "and the precedent and the common sense",
    "so we ask you to uphold this search",
    "council i have one",
    "i have one additional question you know",
    "we're talking about the",
    "legality of this and the language of the",
    "statute and the manual but",
    "the context is somebody is being stopped",
    "because they put a part of a tire",
    "on the fog line i mean how i i",
    "can't i'm concerned about the broader",
    "implications of saying that",
    "that now anybody can be stopped simply",
    "because",
    "they drifted a part of a tire onto a fog",
    "line",
    "what do you what do you make of the",
    "broader implications of this",
    "sure a couple of answers at your honor",
    "first",
    "if what we want so that officers um",
    "use their discretion wisely is that",
    "brightline rules",
    "which we talk about all the time",
    "figuratively in here literally bright",
    "rhyme rules are actually",
    "easier to apply if you're watching",
    "whether it's watching a video",
    "or listening to an officer's testimony",
    "it's easier to say did you touch or not",
    "than have a line of whether you went",
    "over to the other side because frankly",
    "once your tire is halfway over the",
    "stripe",
    "whether you can even see whether you've",
    "crossed to the other side",
    "it's easier to see touching or not the",
    "other thing about that is as the court",
    "below pointed out",
    "that we for simplicity look at tires but",
    "realistically",
    "if you picture not just a stripe but a",
    "plane in space if there were a wall",
    "there",
    "your bumpers and your side view mirrors",
    "are actually several inches over the",
    "line by the time they're touching",
    "um and sometimes uh you know cars do",
    "scrape mirror against mirror happen to",
    "me once it's uh",
    "that's unsafe so touching the line",
    "actually means",
    "in space your car is over lined but the",
    "other thing ultimately",
    "where they suggest that officers might",
    "abuse this power by saying it happened",
    "when it didn't",
    "now i think first not only do i have",
    "more trust in the honesty of our",
    "officers and our dash cams",
    "but the fact that there are so many",
    "appellate court cases",
    "about just touching the lines says",
    "something about the honesty of all the",
    "officers across the state",
    "that they admit openly look he just",
    "touched the line he didn't go over",
    "if you're going to say there was a touch",
    "when there wasn't you might as well just",
    "say",
    "well he went all the way over because",
    "after the fact",
    "as between the officers testimony and",
    "the person we now know was",
    "two and a half times the legal drinking",
    "limit you know let's be honest that",
    "this doesn't appreciably change",
    "how much discretion you have you can",
    "pull someone over for being one mile",
    "over the speed limit",
    "we don't often but it's perfectly legal",
    "to do so we don't get a free five miles",
    "that the court imposes into the law even",
    "if in practice we don't give many",
    "tickets for driving",
    "66 or 67 so there's no real expansion",
    "here if anything",
    "there's a clarification just like with",
    "any area of law",
    "a bright line is easier to see and",
    "easier to apply",
    "than when you're sort of in the middle",
    "of the line or over the line",
    "so this actually serves the purpose of",
    "clarity and doesn't eat away at it",
    "thank you thank you council",
    "uh mr ferris",
    "thank you your honor so there are",
    "several things i'd like to address first",
    "of all the idea of lane lines as buffers",
    "frankly is not found in the orc",
    "not found in the omu tcd it's an idea",
    "that the state",
    "makes up for lack of a better word to",
    "support their finding here",
    "and there's a lot of examples that show",
    "just the opposite including the language",
    "of the omu tcd that was brought up",
    "earlier",
    "which in my opinion makes clear that",
    "you're allowed to touch the line but not",
    "cross it",
    "second if lane lines are buffers then",
    "when we think about the fog line in",
    "particular that would actually serve to",
    "push",
    "traffic back towards the middle which",
    "frankly would be more dangerous",
    "lane lines are not required on one lane",
    "roads but one lane roads",
    "do often have uh lane lines and if",
    "they're not required on one lane roads",
    "and they must",
    "not be required there as buffers so if",
    "they're on the one lane roads they must",
    "be there for some other reason",
    "to provide notice to provide warning for",
    "motorists they're not being used as",
    "buffers there",
    "the park car and curb example provided",
    "by",
    "mr horton frankly cars and curbs are not",
    "replacing",
    "the edge lines there's reasons we can't",
    "touch cars and curbs one they're not",
    "part of the roadway so they'd be",
    "excluded by the definition of 45 1101",
    "uh two you can't just ram your vehicle",
    "into a into a",
    "curb or a car and frankly at flame lines",
    "for buffers we would want lane",
    "lane lines uh in those situations to",
    "keep motorists away",
    "under the state's reasoning from parked",
    "vehicles or from pedestrians on the",
    "sidewalk",
    "but since they're explicitly not used in",
    "those situations it suggests again",
    "that the reason for lane mines is not as",
    "buffers but as something else",
    "and there's other examples in my brief",
    "from the omu gcd showing that lane lines",
    "are not actually buffers",
    "i'd like to address quickly what about",
    "the",
    "point that mr kearney makes that if",
    "you're driving",
    "on the lane line okay the fog",
    "line your car is actually over",
    "the line uh because that's where",
    "your doors and you know the the side of",
    "your car",
    "is uh how do you address that",
    "so that is not something that's ever",
    "been held uh",
    "to to be prohibited by the revised code",
    "by any",
    "case or or court that's ever looked at",
    "this and that's going to create a whole",
    "host of problems",
    "um first of all a lot of problem it's a",
    "problem to acknowledge",
    "that if the tire is riding along",
    "the white line that",
    "the fact is part of the car is over the",
    "line",
    "so if we accept that then we have to say",
    "that when trucks",
    "especially big trucks and trailers it",
    "they their tires wouldn't even be",
    "touching the line",
    "and their mirrors would be over the line",
    "and into the other lane so those trucks",
    "even without touching the line would be",
    "creating a violation",
    "and a lot of these vehicles wouldn't",
    "even be allowed on the road they just",
    "would not fit",
    "plus now we're creating a situation",
    "where police officers and this is",
    "already a difficult situation for them",
    "potentially but they have to imagine an",
    "invisible line down from somebody's",
    "mirror to the ground to decide if",
    "there's been a more plane violation",
    "that's just impractical it frankly be",
    "unfair to drivers and unfair to law",
    "enforcement",
    "and again this will keep many legitimate",
    "motorists off the road we would have to",
    "widen all of the roads if we were going",
    "to take that approach",
    "i do have a few other points that i'd",
    "like to address i see obviously that",
    "over my time if i'm allowed to answer",
    "them i will if not i understand",
    "you've used your time thank you thank",
    "you honor thank you we'll take the",
    "matter under advisement you'll be",
    "notified of our decision",
    "one",
    "our next case is 2019-1700 the state of",
    "ohio versus christian carlisle",
    "for the appellate mr mackin warning",
    "duke justice o'connor fellow justices",
    "deputy solicitor general bryant",
    "may please court my name is justin",
    "mackin with the lake county public",
    "defender's office",
    "now i'd like to reserve three minutes",
    "for rebuttal separation of powers",
    "doctrine",
    "is born from our constitutional",
    "framework with a concern to ensure",
    "integrity and dependence of each branch",
    "in",
    "our orc 2909 15 d2b",
    "which are referred to here on ali the",
    "reduction provision",
    "violates that from that constitutional",
    "framework now broadly speaking the",
    "statute requires the defendant convicted",
    "of an arson defense",
    "to register for a lifetime partisan",
    "registry unless the prosecuting attorney",
    "and investigating agency",
    "allows the judge to consider the",
    "sentencing of a period",
    "not less than 10 years that provision",
    "violates the separation of powers in two",
    "ways",
    "a counselor counselor what do you mean",
    "by the word allow",
    "well in our position that the",
    "judge cannot consider anything other",
    "than a mandatory registration",
    "unless the investigating agency and the",
    "prosecutor",
    "says we are allowing you or we say we",
    "are okay",
    "with saying that you can consider this",
    "reduction it's",
    "it's a it's a request right by",
    "investigating",
    "um the arson investigator and the",
    "prosecutor",
    "yes but if in the if at least how the",
    "uh this provision is written if either",
    "the prosecuting attorney says",
    "does not request it or the investigating",
    "agency doesn't request it",
    "then the judges did not have any kind of",
    "discretion",
    "so but but that's in that but that's in",
    "the revised code i mean",
    "the general assembly decided what the",
    "legislation",
    "i mean with the registration",
    "requirements would be",
    "and and that's what i would like to",
    "point to state b sterling because",
    "the issue we have they're substantially",
    "similar to the one we had",
    "in that case where a prosecuting",
    "attorney before the uh a request for",
    "by an inmate for dna testing could be",
    "reviewed for any decision by the um",
    "judicial branch was was the prosecutor",
    "was the prosecutor in this case opposed",
    "to a 10-year",
    "term no um so",
    "is this case even properly be forced i",
    "mean did the did the judge",
    "was the problem here the judge said i",
    "don't have any discretion to do this",
    "as i mentioned in my reply brief there's",
    "two bases",
    "um that i believe that we are properly",
    "here the first being that",
    "the record um doesn't have any kind of",
    "investigating",
    "investigative agency so as i mentioned",
    "before",
    "we have to have both of these requests",
    "on the record right what",
    "about the judge i mean i mean you're",
    "i mean it doesn't seem here the problem",
    "was that the judge",
    "thought that he couldn't impose a",
    "10-year term the record seems pretty",
    "clear he just didn't want to",
    "i i i disagree that the record is clear",
    "from that there's several moments",
    "on both in the plea and the sentencing",
    "where the judge says",
    "i have to inform you that there is a",
    "mandatory registration without",
    "mentioning any kind of possibility of a",
    "reduction",
    "uh and and again there is no mention of",
    "the requirements the investigating",
    "agency",
    "um i'll would request that reduction",
    "so not only that now so let me ask a",
    "question",
    "if we agree with you and we sever out",
    "subsection b in its entirety doesn't",
    "your client lose",
    "what i believe would happen under the",
    "geiger test",
    "is that it needs to be remanded or",
    "resented",
    "uh that the way that the",
    "unconstitutional",
    "um but heart of the eliminated if we",
    "eliminate the provision you're saying is",
    "unconstitutional the only",
    "right the judge has is to make it",
    "forever for the life of the arsonist",
    "well so as i explained in my mayor",
    "briefed up",
    "our position is that the portion so we",
    "don't need to",
    "remove the entirety of d2b but only a",
    "portion of it",
    "um specifically the conditional",
    "requirement that",
    "you can reduce it to a non-mandatory",
    "lifetime not less than 10 years",
    "if the prosecuting attorney",
    "investigating uh",
    "agency allows it that's what everything",
    "everywhere doesn't enforce the intent of",
    "the legislature and they",
    "obviously felt that there could be a",
    "change but",
    "under only under certain conditions so",
    "wouldn't we have to donate the entire",
    "provision",
    "i think there are two apparent",
    "intentions here the first",
    "uh which is mentioned in state v read uh",
    "that analyzed this registration is that",
    "there's a need here to want to protect",
    "the public but also which is mentioned",
    "in state b ding is that",
    "there's a apparent intention to have",
    "some",
    "kind of option if not lifetime i think",
    "the best analogy to this is",
    "a decision this court made four years",
    "ago in state of knowing",
    "where it was an issue about how the",
    "review was supposed to happen",
    "so in that case um the specific",
    "statute uh was that was senator",
    "an offender sentenced to death may",
    "appeal trial force denial of application",
    "for post-conviction dna testing",
    "by seeking leave of the supreme court in",
    "that case",
    "by taking out the levo supreme court the",
    "intention",
    "was still there the overall scheme was",
    "still there",
    "but the unconstitutional function to",
    "take now",
    "our position is that the",
    "unconstitutional function to get to that",
    "exception is by giving the executive",
    "branch",
    "this unconstitutional power counselor if",
    "if the prosecuting attorney and the",
    "investigator",
    "request that the registration period be",
    "for 10 years instead of lifetime",
    "is it required do you read the statute",
    "to require that the court",
    "make the registration ten years yeah",
    "i believe that that and actually that is",
    "how",
    "i would prefer the statute be severed",
    "that the judge just",
    "have that discretion uh",
    "so they can make the request and the",
    "judge can deny the request and still",
    "impose the lifetime registration",
    "requirement correct",
    "right then how is it that you're saying",
    "this executive branch",
    "allows or disallows or gets to control",
    "what",
    "the trial court sentence or what the",
    "trial court",
    "decides with registration",
    "the statute only allows the request and",
    "i understand",
    "i i think the statute is problematic too",
    "in that the request can only come from",
    "the prosecuting attorney and",
    "along with the investigative agency that",
    "the way the statute is written the",
    "defense counsel can't even make the",
    "request",
    "but it but it is just a request and",
    "although there might be some problems",
    "with the statute how is it if they",
    "cannot dictate what the trial court does",
    "how is it a problem with separation of",
    "powers",
    "uh and to bring it back to stevie",
    "sterling so the way",
    "uh our position is is that in let's",
    "just for just for sterling that i'm an",
    "inmate who wants to",
    "ask the court for a dna test but there's",
    "a stop in the middle",
    "and it has to the prosecutors have to",
    "say yes you're allowed to move on",
    "or they can stop it right there",
    "here the request it's completely",
    "ascendant thing",
    "that let's say the defender the",
    "defendant wants to ask for",
    "uh some sort of reduction but",
    "the judge can't consider that because",
    "there's a stop just like there was in",
    "sterling",
    "if the investigating agency and the",
    "prosecutor doesn't",
    "also agree the judge cannot consider it",
    "under this under how it's written",
    "currently",
    "so it doesn't have to be the even the",
    "defense attorney asking for it if the",
    "judge",
    "in their discretion you know in",
    "sentencing",
    "would like to impose 10 years but",
    "their hands are tied and they have to do",
    "the lifetime appointment",
    "because the trigger to get to the 10",
    "year the lesser requirement is",
    "the action by the prosecutor and the",
    "investigating agency in tandem",
    "and i find that to be problematic",
    "because of the uh it's it's",
    "um the the imposition it puts on the",
    "judge",
    "of not being able to use you know there",
    "there's a",
    "there's a lesser uh registration",
    "requirement to be had",
    "but the step to get there uh doesn't",
    "allow the judge to use discretion",
    "i agree and i think that's the",
    "overruling influence that",
    "that was argued in sterling but i also",
    "want to move on to",
    "this another point that there's two ways",
    "that",
    "this uh doctrine is violated uh one we",
    "haven't talked about is that this is",
    "a final decision and again it's kind of",
    "the same",
    "idea that i was talking about with this",
    "stop this is a sentencing issue so even",
    "even in sterling where uh there's a",
    "relevant power",
    "uh of the executive branch to prove",
    "guilt or innocence and dna was related",
    "to that power",
    "here is entirely sentencing and",
    "by having this kind of stop gap from",
    "it to to the judge they're making a",
    "decision",
    "that is appealable to no one and just as",
    "it was",
    "found unconstitutional on that basis in",
    "sterling i agree that that is an",
    "entirely separate reason that this",
    "course in the statute is also",
    "unconstitutional so there are two",
    "entirely different ways that that we get",
    "to that point",
    "so um i do want to get",
    "uh back to the geiger test because i",
    "think that the issue here is going to be",
    "the um the way it reads",
    "and i know we've we've brought it up",
    "before the first and third question is",
    "whether or not it needs any additional",
    "insertion of words",
    "or if it can stand by itself you take",
    "out every other word in this provision",
    "after",
    "if then you have discretion that the",
    "judge can decide a mandatory lifetime",
    "not lesson or all the way up to not less",
    "than uh 10 years",
    "that is the sentencing power that mr",
    "carlisle is asking for",
    "that's why he's asking that it'd be",
    "remanded",
    "so that this that his sentence at least",
    "considered properly",
    "that it was we're not sure if it was",
    "clear from the record that the judge",
    "believed she could even constitutionally",
    "the or the plea would have been",
    "incorrect because",
    "you there was no investigating agency on",
    "the record",
    "and all of those issues are relevant",
    "here",
    "but i think state v nolling again is is",
    "the best example",
    "of where the ultimate framework of",
    "the statute was more important than the",
    "function that was not working so",
    "just to there where the the way that the",
    "appeal was brought up do the",
    "attorney at trial raise the argument",
    "that you're raising here",
    "the attorney at the police sentence made",
    "it made a um an objection",
    "uh majority below did believe that",
    "they didn't make a proper constitutional",
    "objection but reviewed it",
    "on uh on the standing issue that i also",
    "i didn't mention",
    "uh before mentioned in my brief that uh",
    "it is a issue of great constitutionality",
    "that even if his mootness was destroyed",
    "um which i",
    "forest is standing was destroyed on",
    "moveness which i don't think it does",
    "there's still a case law that supports",
    "that uh this case being reviewed",
    "if there are another other questions",
    "i'll conclude that",
    "this course should find that ohio",
    "revised code 2909",
    "15 d2b is unconstitutional several",
    "language that affords the prosecuting",
    "attorney and investigating agency",
    "discretion",
    "is a reversal or course decision",
    "thank you council",
    "good morning chief justice may i please",
    "the court",
    "the arson registry statute does not",
    "invade the inherent",
    "power of the judiciary and so is",
    "constitutional",
    "it does not interfere with the court's",
    "determination of guilt",
    "it the determination of guilt is made",
    "by the conviction of arson itself which",
    "subjects the person to the registry so",
    "this is not the same as the sterling",
    "case",
    "and choosing the right sentence requires",
    "all three branches of government",
    "to be involved in some fashion the",
    "legislature picks the range",
    "for the crime sets the crime it sets the",
    "punishment the prosecutor chooses what",
    "to prosecute",
    "which itself may have effects on the",
    "sentence that's available",
    "and restrict some sentences from being",
    "available",
    "and the judge imposes the sentence from",
    "among the options",
    "this is how sentencing works it is not",
    "an area where there is an inherent",
    "exclusive power of the judiciary",
    "council could the could the legislature",
    "write a law",
    "let's just say a felony of the second",
    "degree with a sentencing range would be",
    "two to eight years in prison",
    "um and say uh the sentencing range is",
    "two to eight years in prison however",
    "the judge cannot go below five unless",
    "the",
    "prosecutor gives their consent to this",
    "would that be constitutional",
    "i think it would your honor because the",
    "statute can set forth what the criminal",
    "penalties are",
    "and the prosecutor has a role that's",
    "akin to",
    "the charging decision the decision to",
    "plea bargain",
    "the decision among which charges to",
    "pursue after an allied offense",
    "determination and merger is made",
    "i don't think it departs from that and",
    "in this case",
    "certainly the finding of the arson",
    "conviction itself that's the",
    "key fact that's determined and that",
    "there's no question that the trial court",
    "made that finding here based on",
    "the defendant's no contest plea",
    "and in terms of the sentencing",
    "process in the legislature that that has",
    "been a legislative",
    "area in terms of setting the the what",
    "the crime is what the punishment is",
    "that has been true for for some time and",
    "as this court has said",
    "uh a sentence that is inconsistent with",
    "the sentencing statute is",
    "is not even a sentence and so",
    "i i know this question i'm about to ask",
    "you",
    "this really is not specifically before",
    "us but but how does this",
    "work i mean what factors",
    "are considered in a request to reduce",
    "the registration",
    "to 10 years and and and does the trial",
    "court",
    "excuse me does the trial court get to",
    "inquire as to why",
    "there is that request and and do the",
    "requesters have to",
    "you know set forth um something",
    "um articulable other than",
    "they like the defendant and or you know",
    "you know just some",
    "some reason to request that the",
    "registration period be reduced",
    "your honor the sentence doesn't specify",
    "factors",
    "however if if the court were to look at",
    "the sentencing transcript in this case",
    "which is the august 2018",
    "transcript of pages three to four you",
    "you can see how",
    "how it plays out in in this instance the",
    "the defense counsel",
    "asked for the the reduced registration",
    "and represented to the court that the",
    "prosecutor did not",
    "uh the prosecutor agreed with it when",
    "the prosecutor stood up he said",
    "um basically yes i do i don't object to",
    "this",
    "based on his involvement in the case up",
    "to that point to",
    "to address a related point about the",
    "prosecutor and the investigating",
    "agency asking for this certainly the",
    "prosecutor",
    "ordinarily works with the investigating",
    "agency and",
    "can be expected to speak really on",
    "behalf of both",
    "since they're both representing the",
    "state um and there's no indication here",
    "that the investigating agency had any",
    "different view of this matter",
    "but but so what the statute allows is",
    "the investigate the prosecuting",
    "attorney and the investigative and and",
    "what if the two of them",
    "disagree if the two disagree then the",
    "request",
    "isn't valid i mean if if",
    "one of them agrees and the other does",
    "not the court has no",
    "authority to reduce the registration",
    "period is that how you read the statute",
    "i i think it can be read that way",
    "although again in this case we certainly",
    "don't know",
    "i know i know what you're saying i'm",
    "just talking about the the logical",
    "inferences or what logically could",
    "happen here",
    "or if there was a particularly",
    "acrimonious a relationship between",
    "defense counsel and prosecuting attorney",
    "the pres defense counsel might ask the",
    "prosecuting attorney for this reduction",
    "and arbitrarily the prosecuting attorney",
    "could say no",
    "even though the facts would warrant it",
    "well again i i think your honor we start",
    "from the",
    "the point that the general assembly has",
    "set out",
    "that this is a mandatory duty that flows",
    "from the arson conviction itself",
    "i agree i agree and again i know we're",
    "looking at separation of",
    "of powers here but it just i guess it",
    "just seems strange",
    "that um there would be the power",
    "from the perspective of the prosecuting",
    "attorney",
    "and the and the um and the investigator",
    "to",
    "lower um sanctions",
    "former defendant when that's really",
    "that's defense counsel's baileywick",
    "where you think they make the request",
    "that they hold the power to",
    "to initiate request and and actually",
    "um to initiate a lowering of the",
    "defendant's",
    "sanction when the defense counsel can't",
    "even do that",
    "but but as i said earlier i you know",
    "whether it's a separation or powers",
    "issue is a different",
    "question to respond",
    "to your honors question a couple of",
    "things in addition to the general",
    "assembly's role you have the",
    "the role the prosecutor in other",
    "instances to make the charging decision",
    "when to plea bargain when to",
    "send someone to a pre-trial diversion",
    "program and those are not thought to",
    "count as a separation of powers problem",
    "to to respond to that point another",
    "analogy i offer for your consideration",
    "is the",
    "under the state's previous indeterminate",
    "sentencing law",
    "you had the adult parole authority",
    "essentially making determinations",
    "um you'd have a an indeterminate",
    "sentence for a longer period of time and",
    "the parole authority would decide",
    "really how long that person would serve",
    "in the",
    "that prison term and that",
    "if you think about it is is not all that",
    "different from",
    "this situation where you have a",
    "prosecutor saying well i think",
    "this person might be a candidate for",
    "a lesser uh registration time and again",
    "bear in mind the registry is only is not",
    "public it is",
    "it is for access by the fire marshal and",
    "by",
    "certain uh fire personnel presumably to",
    "assist in public safety and",
    "and arson investigations which can be",
    "somewhat involved so this is",
    "this is a a little bit different from",
    "some other things for that reason",
    "council you say the prosecutor has these",
    "post-conviction discretionary",
    "um uh you know well not really i mean",
    "uh participation in a diversion program",
    "which is the prosecutor's diversion",
    "program that",
    "you know that's where it resides so",
    "that's a little different",
    "um but here where does law enforcement",
    "the investigating agency",
    "come in uh post a",
    "conviction uh and uh kind of hold the",
    "strings on",
    "on uh what the judge can do",
    "well it's as i said there's separation",
    "of powers let me step back for a minute",
    "separation of powers",
    "as a matter of degree as as your honors",
    "no it's",
    "um it's not like each branch of",
    "government is put in a hermetically",
    "sealed box and so",
    "you're going to have different",
    "interactions at different points in the",
    "system and that's not a problem under",
    "separation of powers and sentencing is a",
    "good example of that because you've got",
    "the three branches with different roles",
    "sometimes to a degree intersect",
    "and that that is allowable um",
    "under separated powers i i offered the",
    "uh analogy on",
    "the question is my question is",
    "where does where does the investigating",
    "agency",
    "exercise that kind of authority you have",
    "it with an elected prosecutor",
    "you have it with other you know",
    "executive branch but i don't see it with",
    "the police all right thank you i",
    "thank you for clarifying i misunderstood",
    "your question i i think that",
    "in most cases probably 99",
    "of cases i can't imagine uh that you",
    "would have",
    "a discrepancy between the prosecutor and",
    "the law enforcement agency",
    "because they do work in tandem why not",
    "just have one",
    "why not just have the prosecutor if",
    "they're aligned but they don't the",
    "statute says both",
    "so explain that to me on how the uh to",
    "me",
    "how the how this authority",
    "given to law enforcement uh can be",
    "uh exercised to thwart the discretion of",
    "a judge",
    "your honor i would i would suggest that",
    "it's because it's unlikely to occur that",
    "this case doesn't present that and",
    "and i don't know that i would want to",
    "speculate too much on how that",
    "might operate in an unusual situation",
    "where there was a discrepancy in a",
    "recommendation because it's",
    "it seems more like the way the statute",
    "is written it's hard to say",
    "whether um it's really an independent",
    "basis",
    "to to block that or it's more a",
    "recognition that",
    "the prosecutor and the law enforcement",
    "agency would be",
    "recommending together because the law",
    "enforcement folks would have had some",
    "interaction with the",
    "individual as they did here if you look",
    "at the defense council's comments she",
    "said all the investigators had a",
    "positive opinion of her",
    "client as a follow-up to that question",
    "couldn't the law enforcement agency just",
    "pocket veto it by not showing up",
    "giving its opinion no your honor because",
    "i think again",
    "you would presume the prosecutor is the",
    "lawyer involved in the case",
    "would be the one speaking to the court",
    "about the recommendation and i",
    "i don't think that would be unusual to",
    "think that that would be a",
    "recommendation from both particularly if",
    "the law enforcement agency isn't coming",
    "in and contradicting it as they",
    "certainly did not hear",
    "but council you would agree that the",
    "statute is written",
    "even though you find it it'd probably be",
    "unlikely",
    "a that as britain",
    "the investigative officer can if you",
    "disagree with the prosecutor's",
    "recommendation to have it reduced as it",
    "was",
    "recommended in this particular case he",
    "could say no i don't agree with that",
    "and and restrict the judge's",
    "uh discretion to act on that",
    "i think that would be a an unusual case",
    "and one to to look at how this statute",
    "would operate",
    "at that time but in any event it's there",
    "have been",
    "other uh since we're talking in either",
    "case about the executive branch",
    "and they're both part of the executive",
    "branch it's not unusual to have",
    "discretion in the executive branch at",
    "various levels whether it's the",
    "parole authority whether it's the",
    "governor and his pardon authority or",
    "whether it's a prosecutor",
    "the executive branch obviously you say",
    "has many facets um",
    "and there's a big difference between a",
    "recommendation",
    "uh and the ability to thwart another",
    "branch of government",
    "from doing you know having exercising",
    "their authority",
    "um and here it's not the",
    "uh recommendation that i'm concerned",
    "about",
    "it's the ability to thwart and that's",
    "you know that rests with the police",
    "well i i guess i would see it",
    "differently your honor i i see it as",
    "almost like a separate",
    "uh chart you can have for example you",
    "could imagine two charges one with a",
    "mandatory",
    "lifetime registration and one with",
    "a registration that's subject to being",
    "lowered",
    "if somebody if the prosecutor or the",
    "prosecutor with the police recommended",
    "it and",
    "we wouldn't think that that having the",
    "two different",
    "charges with the two different results",
    "would be as",
    "the results of a of an arson conviction",
    "would be a problem under separation of",
    "powers and i don't believe it is here",
    "either",
    "just because a prosecutor recommends a",
    "sentence",
    "doesn't mean the court has to accept it",
    "correct in sentencing in sentencing",
    "decision that",
    "this is this is somewhat different from",
    "that but i think a process you could",
    "have a statute",
    "where there could be a recommendation",
    "that was written in",
    "such a way that allowed the prosecutor",
    "to have a role",
    "in uh input in the sentence i i don't",
    "think that is",
    "off the table for separation of powers",
    "purposes is this a criminal sentence i",
    "mean is this a criminal punishment at",
    "all",
    "i think that's an issue your honor that",
    "you don't need to decide in this case",
    "because either way it doesn't affect the",
    "separation of powers analysis whether",
    "it's",
    "punishment or not although it certainly",
    "has some uh",
    "it has characteristics of a civil",
    "remedial",
    "provision which is what it's not",
    "characterized",
    "if it's not a punishment isn't a real",
    "easy question i mean",
    "the executive branches has all kinds of",
    "civil",
    "uh registration requirements so if if",
    "it's not a punishment then",
    "it doesn't seem like any of these issues",
    "are implicated would they be",
    "i i would agree with your honor i think",
    "that's that's a fair",
    "uh assessment if this is the civil",
    "remedial provision and that is what the",
    "courts of appeals have characterized it",
    "as and and it is",
    "it certainly has those characteristics",
    "although again",
    "i don't know you'd have to decide that",
    "here if i may briefly respond on the",
    "severability point um",
    "as somebody noted the geiger test does",
    "talk about whether something can",
    "stand on its own and hear the language",
    "that the defendant would like",
    "for you to take out of the statute the",
    "if the judge receives a request from the",
    "prosecutor etc",
    "that can't stand on its own so under the",
    "geiger test",
    "as it's been applied uh for the most",
    "part over the years this would not be",
    "the proper way to sever and to sever it",
    "the",
    "and when i say sever i mean hold",
    "unenforceable",
    "um in in this instance um the way to do",
    "that is as we suggest in our brief",
    "would be to take all of d2b out which",
    "would then",
    "leave anyone with a lifetime",
    "registration i see that my time is",
    "expired",
    "and if there are no further questions i",
    "thank the court",
    "ask the court to either dismiss the case",
    "or from the judgment below",
    "thank you i'd like to address two",

    "by the state um have in my opinion a",
    "flawed basis of where",
    "the judicial branch and executive branch",
    "should end i think one of the most",
    "egregious",
    "points was uh the answer to one of the",
    "justice questions that",
    "if a range was from two to eight years",
    "but a cross feeder",

    "opinion that is",

    "said",

    "um response i want to make is that st",

    "this is a lot different than that right",
    "i don't believe that there's any support",

    "notification and registration is",
    "punitive",
    "there's no distinction that one is more",

    "no case law that establishes that",

    "disagree i think that there's enough",
    "similarities in the registration",
    "namely that it subjects you",
    "to a ten years to a lifetime where if",
    "you",
    "are on parole or prc and you fail to",
    "register then that's a violation",
    "if you that isn't of itself is a felony",

    "within colombia's service territory",

    "for those programs",
    "was unsupported by the record",
    "the 1995 stipulation also specifically",
    "addressed the prohibition",
    "of duplication of facilities again",
    "to settle the underlining issues in",
    "these cases",
    "as part of the 1995 stipulation if you",
    "look at page two",

    "facilities and customers between the",
    "parties in order to rationalize",
    "each country each company's distribution",

    "the parties were separating their",
    "systems and transferring customers",
    "to prevent the duplication of system",
    "additionally the 1995 stipulation",
    "contained a provision that",

    "circumstances",
    "the there was an exception the exception",
    "allowed colombia to construct",
    "high-pressure pipelines",

    "there would be no need to create this",
    "exception",
    "allowing duplication in certain",
    "circumstances instead this entire",

    "this provision would be pointless there",
    "would be no need for this provision",
    "allowing colombia to needlessly",
    "duplicate suburban facilities is also",

    "who duplicates facilities",
    "your honors columbia violated the 1995",
    "stipulation and exceeded the authority",

    "have to face competition",
    "they want to be able to expand their",
    "service area while",
    "locking columbia into the areas it",
    "already serves",
    "i want to be clear about one thing there",
    "are no exclusive territories for gas",
    "companies",
    "in the natural gas industry in the state",
    "of ohio as there are for electric",
    "companies",
    "as the commission has stated any",
    "certified gas company may serve",
    "customers",
    "anywhere in the state has been talked",
    "about as service territory",
    "as uh the the commission uh uh",
    "defined it uh that's the general area",
    "where the company is serving or capable",
    "of serving customers",
    "it's not exclusive and is subject to",
    "change",
    "one company isn't locked into a",
    "particular area it can expand that area",
    "and that's what columbia did here",
    "it expanded its pipelines to serve a new",
    "residential development as the the home",
    "builder there",
    "chose chose colombia",
    "the the commission reviewed the 1995",
    "stipulation",
    "which had had approved and found that it",
    "did not bar columbia from offering",
    "energy efficiency incentives",
    "or otherwise serving customers in",
    "southern southern delaware county",
    "the commission had approved this",
    "stipulation originally",
    "it's really in the best position to",
    "interpret that stipulation and i would",
    "ask the court to give that",
    "interpretation deference",
    "the stipulation resolved the dispute",
    "over particular customers",
    "and it said nothing about energy",
    "efficiency programs",
    "or any geographic limitations on",
    "either company's ability to serve there",
    "were some programs that were",
    "in effect then they were discontinued",
    "but those",
    "are not comparable to the programs that",
    "we have now with columbia which are",
    "energy efficiency programs",
    "there are no programs of that kind back",
    "in 1995.",
    "i would add that even if the stipulation",
    "could be",
    "could be read to limit competition or",
    "fix uh",
    "territories that would violate state law",
    "and policy",
    "and would be unenforceable i would offer",
    "the court an analogy",
    "say there were two law firms here in",
    "columbus that had a",
    "dispute over who was entitled to uh the",
    "fee",
    "from a particular uh case",
    "and uh they ended up resolving this case",
    "not only over the fee but saying",
    "well firm a will only take clients from",
    "north abroad and",
    "firm b will only take clients from south",
    "of broad street",
    "well i don't think these court would",
    "approve of such an agreement in fact",
    "i think it would violate the court of",
    "professional conduct and the court",
    "certainly would not enforce that that's",
    "basically what suburban is asking you",
    "to do here to enforce uh an agreement",
    "that in their mind",
    "limits customer choices",
    "the commission also examined what",
    "colombia was doing with its uh demand",
    "sign management or dsm program",
    "it looked at the order where it had",
    "approved these programs and found no",
    "violations",
    "the commission uh further noted that an",
    "advantage shouldn't be",
    "taken away from colombia just because",
    "the other competing company",
    "doesn't have a similar incentive and i",
    "would like to make",
    "another point very clear suburban could",
    "have its own",
    "dsm program if it filed a proper",
    "application",
    "and obtained approval suburban had filed",
    "an application for such a program back",
    "in 2011",
    "but the commission found it defective",
    "and sent it back",
    "well for whatever reason uh suburban in",
    "the past nine years",
    "had never has never even attempted to uh",
    "to refile an application for for a",
    "program that met the requirements",
    "but customers shouldn't be penalized",
    "just because suburban",
    "uh doesn't have this program uh hasn't",
    "even applied for",
    "customers should be able to take",
    "advantage of these programs",
    "when they're when they're being offered",
    "yeah mr lindgren",
    "what what do you have to say about miss",
    "boyko's",
    "comments regarding the energy efficiency",
    "standards",
    "um that as i understand are saying that",
    "we're not",
    "really satisfied here well your honor",
    "the commission still found that uh",
    "there were no violations of the uh",
    "energy efficiency",
    "standards they found that found that the",
    "uh",
    "that club he had comply with the",
    "commission rose in the commission order",
    "and uh that uh",
    "are those findings reviewable by us uh",
    "yes but i would ask you to defer to the",
    "uh commission's factual findings in this",
    "area and defer to their their expertise",
    "in this area",
    "i would add that uh columbia's uh dsm",
    "program is subject to an annual audit",
    "to make sure that all their uh money is",
    "being spent properly and if the",
    "commission",
    "or staff finds any violations uh that",
    "can be uh dealt with and uh",
    "uh money uh recoup for customers",
    "if it's been misused",
    "thank you uh your honor",
    "your honors uh the customers in delaware",
    "county shouldn't be denied access to the",
    "dsm",
    "program simply because suburban is",
    "not able really through their own choice",
    "of being able to offer the same program",
    "suburban had the burden of proof to show",
    "violations of the stipulation",
    "or any of commissioned law or order they",
    "haven't done so",
    "this uh they haven't met their burden of",
    "proof this order is lawful and",
    "reasonable",
    "and it should be affirmed are you the",

    "columbia gas",
    "thank you mr stem thank you good morning",

    "the actual decision by the developer to",
    "choose colombia",
    "but there were so many reasons that",
    "colombia gave that distinguished itself",

    "there's no evidence as found by the",
    "commission that the fact of the",

    "developer and in fact your honor there's",
    "evidence in the record",
    "from ms young who talked to the",
    "developer directly about this",
    "and the developer told her that the",
    "incentives were really a non-factor",
    "because they did not nearly cover the",
    "cost",
    "of meeting the energy efficiency",
    "standards in terms of the construction",

    "there's also distribution sub mains for",
    "every subdivision street in this new",

    "our merit brief",
    "every dubious perpetual service",

    "address a couple of questions i heard",
    "while i was waiting um first of all in",
    "terms of the releases on the stipulation",
    "nothing in the stipulation speaks to",
    "what's going to happen in the future",
    "that was a very specific agreement that",
    "indicated it was so",

    "in the future in a specific area",
    "they certainly contain no prohibition",
    "and the contention today that we saw for",
    "the first time in the reply brief",
    "that paragraph 10 of the stipulation",
    "which concerns that high pressure",
    "pipeline mention",
    "note your honors suburban did not raise",
    "at any time",
    "below or in its notice of appeal it's",
    "argument that the 1995 stipulation",
    "contains",
    "one exception to the general ban it",
    "claims on duplication of facilities",
    "and that the pipeline serving glenn ross",
    "does not qualify for that exception they",
    "cannot raise it for the first time",
    "in its reply brief before the ohio",
    "supreme court",
    "and i would note that the language of",
    "that paragraph does not support",
    "their interpretation in any event",
    "with that i would answer any further",
    "questions your honors have",
    "if not i would say i would argue that",

    "lawful and reasonable",
    "and should be affirmed thank you very",

    "thank you miss boyko uh you've saved",

    "you'll have to unmute your your",
    "microphone",
    "thank you your honor first i'd like to",
    "correct a few missed statements",
    "first of all if you look at page 2 of",
    "the 1995 stipulation",
    "and then go to page 7 it actually does",
    "list the mark of efficiency program",
    "as an efficiency program that existed at",
    "the time as well as three builder",
    "incentive programs",
    "these programs are similarly situated",
    "and thus are prohibited by the 1995",
    "stipulation",
    "the 1995 stipulation and the",
    "interpretation of its very terms",
    "has always been at the heart of this",
    "case and for council",
    "to suggest otherwise is just does not",
    "make any sense we have stated that the",
    "commission",
    "failed to follow the 1995 stipulation",
    "specific language",
    "on page two of the stipulation it says",
    "that this case is a resolution",
    "of the party's competitive dispute and",
    "rationalization of their distribution",
    "system",
    "the duplication of the system has been",
    "at the heart of this issue",
    "from the very very beginning to be clear",
    "suburban is not challenging the energy",
    "efficiency program itself",
    "it is challenging how colombia is using",
    "the builder incentive program a part of",
    "that program",
    "as a competitive tool suburban did try",
    "to file",
    "its own builder incentive program as a",
    "competitive tool",
    "and that case was rejected because the",
    "commission said",
    "it never approved a writer with its",
    "intended purpose",
    "of a standalone program that was not",
    "directed to the utility's existing",
    "customers",
    "but was charged to those customers",
    "and to mr lindgren's point suburban",
    "could not",
    "offer a dsm program to the extent of",
    "columbia",
    "gas it has 17 000 customers not a",
    "million customers it couldn't spread the",
    "cost",
    "that could compete with colombia and",
    "that is the whole point",
    "the energy efficiency program was just",
    "that it was to incentivize",
    "energy-efficient homes within colombia's",
    "service territory",
    "as you as chief justice recognized",
    "colombia went outside their",
    "territory offered these incentives and",
    "then had to construct a facility",
    "to be able to support and serve those",
    "customers",
    "that is not prohibited or that is not",
    "allowed",
    "by both the 1995 stipulation as well as",
    "the energy efficiency program itself",
    "that was approved by the commission",
    "and put in its tariffs colombia can",
    "expand its territory no one is arguing",
    "that it can't",
    "but it has to do it in an",
    "anti-competitive manner",
    "and it also has to do it with reasonable",
    "competition",

    "the state of ohio versus roger simpson",

    "troutman and i represent the amicus",
    "curay on behalf of roger simpson",

    "rebuttal please",
    "so the ohio public defender as amicus",
    "curie urges this court to reverse",
    "the lower court's decision and to hold",
    "that at that initial application stage",
    "of the 26b",
    "an applicant should not be required to",
    "demonstrate",
    "that he conclusively demonstrate",
    "prejudice",
    "a genuine issue of a colorable claim",

    "in 2016. so requiring",

    "for a paladin effectiveness in that",
    "application stage",
    "it does not fit with the purpose behind",
    "26b",
    "essentially the courts are deciding the",
    "underlying issue before they're ever",
    "hearing the case on the merits",
    "so the purpose of 2016 is to give",
    "defendants that opportunity that they",
    "missed",
    "and it started with state versus monahan",
    "in this court",
    "it's a means for enforcing that right to",
    "the effective assistance of appellate",
    "council",
    "this court",
    "how do we determine effectiveness versus",
    "ineffectiveness",
    "if prejudice isn't part of the equation",
    "for your honor it is not that prejudice",
    "would not be a part of the equation it's",
    "simply that the standard should be lower",
    "um at that application stage the the",
    "most of the applicants",
    "are pro prefer you've gone lower lower",
    "than what specifically",
    "we have provided some um some",
    "language in our brief that is a",
    "potential",
    "um standards that this court could use",
    "for example in",
    "uh the the",
    "certificate of appealabilities in",
    "federal court the standard is a",
    "kind of a probable cause standard and um",
    "essentially the jurists of reason simply",
    "have to be able to conclude that the",
    "issues presented are adequate to deserve",
    "encouragement to proceed further that is",
    "more of a standard that is more of a",
    "workable standard for an applicant who",
    "is is not represented by council",
    "who doesn't have access to the full",
    "record in fact",
    "the rule itself contemplates that the",
    "applicant may not have the record",
    "available to them at the time they're",
    "filing their application",
    "but then what what then prevents an",
    "applicant let's say a pro se",
    "applicant from then raising every",
    "possible",
    "thing or matter that appellate council",
    "did not do",
    "some instance of which might have been",
    "strategic",
    "or had no chance of prevailing how how",
    "do we discern",
    "between those colorable i guess",
    "deficiencies by council versus those",
    "that are not",
    "well your honor those those should be",
    "fared it out",
    "but that should not occur necessarily at",
    "the application stage",
    "if if an issue deserves encouragement to",
    "proceed further",
    "then in that full briefing if there's",
    "strategy issues at play",
    "all of that could come out in the",
    "briefing and at that point the court",
    "does not have to",
    "open re or grant a new um trial or",
    "sentencing phase",
    "because the win here a win for a 26b",
    "application",
    "is simply the ability to file a brief is",
    "that an issue even in front of us",
    "uh your honor issue you're kind of",
    "asking us just to write a kind of",
    "advisory opinion isn't that",
    "know your honor the the issue before",
    "this court with regard to state versus",
    "roger simpson is the proper test for",
    "appellate effectiveness",
    "uh mr simpson's council has we accepted",
    "a",
    "a specific propositional law that deals",
    "with applying the",
    "mates the mapes factors it seems like",
    "uh the party that advocated that",
    "propositional law isn't even arguing and",
    "you're arguing for",
    "something that might be useful but it's",
    "it's certainly not the issue in the case",
    "is it",
    "well actually your honor the appellant",
    "did in fact present in his brief that",
    "although he used the mate factors as his",
    "guard as a guide",
    "that the first stage should apply the",
    "that makes factors in a lower burden",
    "and then during the second fact the",
    "second stage the the maze factors will",
    "be used",
    "um as a whole so even if even if we",
    "presume that the",
    "maze test is the proper test for this",
    "court to adopt",
    "um it is a useful tool it could be a",
    "useful tool for this court",
    "but the reason we we feel that the mace",
    "test is not the appropriate test for",
    "this court is because when you look to",
    "how mape came about the the sixth",
    "circuit created mape's by",
    "reviewing its own history as to what it",
    "found compelling and an ineffective",
    "assistance of council claim",
    "and so they essentially listed out all",
    "these different holdings in which they",
    "found",
    "that to be a compelling reason to",
    "reverse the case",
    "this court has its own precedent this",
    "court has its own reasons that it could",
    "list out",
    "for for reasons for determining",
    "appellate council is effective or not",
    "effective um but regardless of whatever",
    "standard",
    "that is ultimately applied to determine",
    "the issue of appellate effectiveness",
    "there has to be some sort of of",
    "clarification at the very least for the",
    "underlying courts because like the 12th",
    "district did here",
    "the course of appeals are not uh they're",
    "they're combining the two steps",
    "into that that first application inquiry",
    "we see this in the lower court opinion",
    "here and we see it across",
    "the districts in ohio there's cases such",
    "as",
    "state versus schneider and state versus",
    "spain in which the dissenting judges in",
    "both of those cases pointed out",
    "that we have an issue of in these cases",
    "the majority's analysis",
    "is denying the appellant the ability to",
    "develop and expand his legal argument in",
    "that app",
    "at that brief below all of the issues",
    "are being decided",
    "in the application again",
    "most of these applications are pro pay",
    "so we're expecting pro se",
    "inmates to who aren't even advised of",
    "their their right to to",
    "appellate effectiveness of counsel to",
    "then present their own arguments that",
    "appellate counsel missed",
    "to do it within 90 days of the the",
    "filing of the opinion",
    "to attach affidavits and",
    "do this all without access to the record",
    "as a practice when",
    "when we take these cases when we find",
    "these cases um",
    "for the most part or sometimes the",
    "record's not even complete",
    "so we have to spend the time getting the",
    "transcript",
    "we've had attorneys pay out of their own",
    "pocket to have transcripts",
    "have it transcribed in order for the the",
    "applicant to then be represented on",
    "appeal",
    "so what we get then is meritorious",
    "claims are being missed",
    "and one example of that is when you look",
    "at",
    "this course language in state versus",
    "roberts and then you compare it to the",
    "language and state versus golf",
    "so in state versus roberts this court",
    "discussed they highly",
    "highlighted the importance of the right",
    "of allocution in capital cases",
    "and citing state versus green 2000 case",
    "state versus campbell 2000 case",
    "state versus goff the same issue the",
    "right of allocution",
    "was raised but in emirate in a 26c",
    "and no genuine issue was found by the",
    "accord",
    "so the murder hand the application was",
    "rejected",
    "after the sixth circuit after full",
    "briefing and the sixth circuit had the",
    "benefit of full briefing",
    "they reversed the issue and remanded it",
    "back down because there was a genuine",
    "issue",
    "the right to allocution does matter",
    "so you'll also see in our brief when we",
    "cited state versus schleiger",
    "it's another case in which the federal",
    "court had to um",
    "fix what the 12th district didn't do",
    "because the 12th district was applying",
    "the standard before ever having",
    "the briefing in front of it so one of",
    "the proposed standards that we put in",
    "our brief",
    "is simply the definition of colorable",
    "claims and you get that from black",
    "law dictionary and that is a colorable",
    "claim",
    "is one that is legitimate and may",
    "reasonably be asserted given the facts",
    "presented and the current law",
    "or a reasonable and logical extension or",
    "modification of the current law",
    "another that the further extension of",
    "that is that it could be a fair",
    "probability or likelihood but not a",
    "certitude of success on the merits",
    "courts of appeal are requiring",
    "applicants to demonstrate success on the",
    "merits",
    "and again without access to their record",
    "without access to council which doesn't",
    "come until that second phase",
    "they are unable to meet that burden",
    "at this point your honors i would like",
    "to reserve the remainder of my time for",
    "rebuttal unless you all have any",
    "questions",
    "thank you thank you",
    "madam chief justice and may it please",
    "the court",
    "shop security for the attorney general",
    "and in support of the state",
    "this case presents the court with a",
    "dilemma",
    "simpson asked this court to take this",
    "case",
    "so it could consider adopting an",
    "11-factor checklist",
    "for measuring the council's performance",
    "in the context of claims",
    "based on ineffective assistance of",
    "appellate council",
    "simpson claimed that the sixth circuit",
    "which first articulated these factors in",
    "maps versus coil had adopted these",
    "protectors for itself",
    "and that were this court to follow the",
    "six circuits lead",
    "it would harmonize ohio and federal law",
    "and lead to more predictable and stable",
    "outcomes",
    "but it turns out that the sixth circuit",
    "does not in fact",
    "rely on the mape's factors at least not",
    "with any consistency",
    "and it almost never relies on all of",
    "them at one time",
    "but does that does that prevent us from",
    "adopting them",
    "in whole or in part or using them as",
    "as guidance",
    "your honor so i think this is a point of",
    "agreement actually between the public",
    "defender",
    "and our position and that is that we",
    "don't think",
    "that ohio courts should shun their eyes",
    "from the mapes factors we think that",
    "they certainly can look to them",
    "to the extent that they think they are",
    "relevant but we don't think that this",
    "court",
    "should require appellate courts",
    "to apply every single one of these",
    "factors",
    "or any particular number of these",
    "factors every single time",
    "that an appellate court is confronted",
    "with an ineffective assistance of a",
    "pellet council claim",
    "then what is it that you think that a",
    "court of appeals",
    "should do because the assistant public",
    "defender stated that",
    "court of appeals are looking generally",
    "to see",
    "if there is an indication",
    "of success or merit success just from",
    "the applications",
    "in and of themselves on the first",
    "submission",
    "and uniformly denying those before you",
    "can even get to the substance",
    "isn't that missing out on the the",
    "colorable claim",
    "um in in this case right i take for",
    "example the the",
    "the is the facts in this case and the",
    "underlying case",
    "even the issue of of consecutive",
    "sentences here",
    "if my understanding of the facts is we",
    "had a trial court judge who",
    "imposed sentences on three co-defendants",
    "one",
    "five years one eight years and won 51",
    "years",
    "now i understand of course the",
    "difference between",
    "plea bargains and the benefits of that",
    "and getting some some counts",
    "knowledge or deleted but when you come",
    "to consecutive sentences",
    "the trial court looks at the conduct not",
    "the accounts",
    "so you have a trial court judge deciding",
    "that the conduct",
    "of one of three defendants who are",
    "individually",
    "and responsible for their individual",
    "conduct and each other's conduct",
    "that that uh consecutive sentences",
    "totaling 51 years was warranted based on",
    "the conduct of one",
    "but that only five and eight years is",
    "warranted for the conduct of the other",
    "so that there to me raises a colorful",
    "claim that",
    "that the sentence should have been",
    "challenged by a fellow council in this",
    "case",
    "i appreciate the question your honor so",
    "i want to",
    "sort of take that in three parts first",
    "i don't think that this is the case for",
    "this court to announce",
    "any new standards on this issue",
    "and that is first and foremost because",
    "that's",
    "not what this court accepted an appeal",
    "on so",
    "it just has not been adequately briefed",
    "by",
    "the state by simpson himself and even",
    "the public defender",
    "which has briefed this issue more than",
    "any of the other litigants in this case",
    "did not i don't think in either of the",
    "public defenders briefs",
    "actually apply their standard to this",
    "case",
    "so justice stuart everything you said",
    "may be true",
    "but unfortunately we don't have the",
    "benefit of briefing",
    "even from the public defender who is",
    "making this argument",
    "in applying the standard that they",
    "prefer to the facts of this case",
    "second uh i should just note you know",
    "we don't curl too much with the public",
    "defender",
    "on their particular formulation of the",
    "standard",
    "i think they call it a reasonable",
    "likelihood of success",
    "i don't understand that to be saying",
    "anything much different",
    "than what this court has said in its",
    "precedence when it is said",
    "that it looks for a colorful claim or",
    "the language in the rule itself",
    "which includes the term i think genuine",
    "issue all of those",
    "i think basically say the same thing but",
    "i think more",
    "important and this gets to point three",
    "than the particular formulation that",
    "this court settles upon",
    "is recognizing that all of these",
    "standards even at the application stage",
    "are ultimately applying the underlying",
    "strickland standard",
    "therefore",
    "the council performed reasonably and",
    "that the proceedings",
    "were",
    "it's a tall burden for an applicant to",
    "show that",
    "they have made a genuine showing or a",
    "reasonable likelihood",
    "that they were denied effective",
    "appellate counsel are there mistakes",
    "made",
    "in particular cases sure and we don't",
    "deny that but this council said",
    "shouldn't we get to",
    "get to the part two of the 26",
    "uh of the april 26 motion that that",
    "oftentimes we don't even get to that",
    "evaluation",
    "because there isn't clear proof in the",
    "initial application that appellate",
    "council was",
    "ineffective or that the applicant would",
    "have prevailed",
    "on appeal",
    "well your honor i certainly don't think",
    "that we should get to it in this case",
    "and",
    "the public defender again didn't brief",
    "that issue",
    "so i think the most prudent course",
    "honestly is because simpson himself",
    "isn't here",
    "to press his argument about the mape's",
    "factors and because the public",
    "defender hasn't briefed how the standard",
    "that they're pressing",
    "would apply in this case it is for this",
    "i think the most prudent quarters for",
    "this court to just dismiss this case",
    "as in providently accepted but i i",
    "don't think that proceeding to the",
    "second stage",
    "was warranted in this case uh",
    "i i nobody has really developed an",
    "argument",
    "other than simpson for that and simpson",
    "relied on this argument",
    "based on vapes which you know it turns",
    "out based on even a cursory amount of",
    "research",
    "uh isn't isn't borne out in the case of",
    "the sixth circuit doesn't apply those",
    "factors",
    "and he isn't here to clarify his",
    "argument or to explain why this court",
    "should adopt those",
    "factors notwithstanding notwithstanding",
    "that",
    "thank you sure",
    "uh so i would just reiterate that we",
    "think that the proper",
    "course for this court to take is to",
    "dismiss this case",
    "as in providently accepted or in the",
    "alternative",
    "to affirm the judgment of the 12th",
    "district",
    "if there are no further questions for me",
    "your honor",
    "then that is our respectful submission",
    "to you today",
    "i thank you for allowing me to present",
    "the attorney general's case",
    "thank you",
    "thank you um the ohio public defender",
    "does not represent mr simpson so no we",
    "did not",
    "apply our standard to his claims but",
    "that in no way",
    "should render mr simpson's case as",
    "improvingly accepted",
    "to dispute what the attorney general",
    "said if you review",
    "simpson's brief he most certainly did",
    "apply his mape factor the mate factors",
    "to his claims so that point is simply",
    "because amicus council has decided that",
    "that these issues also affect us they",
    "affect a lot of our clients and we felt",
    "that this court might",
    "like to look at it a little differently",
    "but the issue is the same",
    "that whether we're at the application",
    "stage applying the mape factors or for",
    "simply applying strickland versus",
    "washington which is what this core is",
    "determined",
    "is the test and what the us supreme",
    "court has determined is the test",
    "the applicant himself should not be",
    "required to demonstrate prejudice",
    "if you look at the language that that",
    "courts are",
    "are using to determine whether there is",
    "a colorable claim a genuine issue of a",
    "colorful claim is the exact same",
    "language",
    "that is used once an application is",
    "actually granted",
    "and and the cases are reopened the same",
    "prejudice inquiry",
    "an applicant who is pro se again who",
    "does not have access to his own record",
    "and certainly doesn't have the legal",
    "expertise to present his own uh claims",
    "certainly isn't going to be able to make",
    "that showing so this court needs to",
    "clarify for the lower courts",
    "what that standard actually is and if",
    "they need to use the major factors in",
    "determining",
    "how to get to that lower standard then",
    "then",
    "that would suffice as well but this",
    "court needs to make sure that the lower",
    "courts are not holding these pro site",
    "applicants",
    "in 10 pages within 90 days to the same",
    "standard that they are held if they",
    "actually get their applications accepted",
    "if this court has no further questions i",
    "would just write my case all right",
    "thank you thank you thank you better",
    "under advisement you'll be notified of",
    "our decision",
    "marshall will you adjourn court please",
    "ye hear ye hear ye this open session of",
    "the animal supreme court of ohio",
    "now stands adjourned",
    "you"
