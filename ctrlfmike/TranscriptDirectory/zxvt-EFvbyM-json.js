    "yesterday morning uh",
    "moderna with their drug trials",
    "proceeding very well 95",
    "pfizer the week before so that's very",
    "very good news help",
    "is truly on the way for us in ohio and",
    "across",
    "across the country so very very very",
    "good news",
    "the bad news is that our situation in",
    "ohio is deteriorating",
    "we see more and more cases more and more",
    "people in the hospital",
    "and we've got we've got to turn turn",
    "this thing around",
    "we literally have to build",
    "a bridge to get from here to",
    "the point when we're going to have the",
    "immunity",
    "uh from the vaccine so we got to get we",
    "got to get over this we got to get over",
    "this bad",
    "bad spot i'm going to talk today about",
    "some of the things that",
    "we can do uh it sounds like reports i'm",
    "getting around ohio we're already",
    "starting to",
    "to do that more and more people are",
    "wearing masks and retail",
    "outlets which is just great great great",
    "news",
    "so let's um eric eric is back",
    "good to see you eric let's take a look",
    "at",
    "the numbers let's go to today's slide",
    "uh seven thousand cases this has been",
    "running between",
    "seven and eight thousand uh for about a",
    "week",
    "um six weeks ago we were",
    "at about a thousand so it's gone up",
    "dramatically",
    "a number of deaths sadly at 30",
    "hospitalizations uh way up 368 we'll",
    "talk about hospitalizations in a moment",
    "those people in the hospital",
    "21 day average was only was 210 and icu",
    "admissions is up",
    "a little bit as well let's talk a little",
    "bit",
    "about hospitalization",
    "october 13th we had a thousand people",
    "in our hospitals in ohio who had covet",
    "november 5th that number was 2 000.",
    "by november 12th that number had gone",
    "from 2 000",
    "to 3 000. and you",
    "look at today's number 3648",
    "so this is just as you can tell",
    "going up dramatically you'll see",
    "that the yellow is the icu",
    "and that's going up certainly as well",
    "and you'll see",
    "covered positive hospitalized is the is",
    "the purple",
    "so just a dramatic dramatic change i",
    "spent yesterday",
    "traveling around in some of the",
    "southeastern parts of the state as well",
    "as the northwestern part",
    "of ohio i had doctors with me to stop",
    "and each one of them described what they",
    "were seeing in their",
    "in their local local hospital uh",
    "let's let's uh the icu let me give you",
    "the icu numbers",
    "um one month ago we had 280",
    "of our fellow ohioans in icu uh",
    "today we have 900. so a dramatic",
    "dramatic uh increase of those in that",
    "in that situation so eric let's take a",
    "look at the next one",
    "this is our slide of course 88 counties",
    "ranked by highest occurrence and again",
    "as you'll see every single county",
    "every single county is now a high",
    "incidence",
    "and these numbers continue to go up even",
    "for the counties that have the least",
    "if you spread here makes county for",
    "example",
    "still these are high these are high",
    "numbers",
    "every every county in the state is at",
    "least two times",
    "the high incident level set by the cdc",
    "eric let's look at the",
    "top 20. and if you look at the top 20",
    "these are astronomical numbers",
    "you know if you look at the top five",
    "putnam mercer allen lake all glazed",
    "um it you know these numbers are just",
    "um shocking it means that one out of a",
    "hundred people in the last two weeks",
    "i was diagnosed with coba so",
    "just think about the odds and we know",
    "that's always lower than",
    "not everybody's diagnosed not everyone",
    "has the test",
    "and so what that means is that",
    "dramatically increases the chance of",
    "someone in those",
    "counties running into somebody who does",
    "in fact have the coven and again it's",
    "it's the reason for the mask",
    "it's the reason for the for the",
    "distancing",
    "all right eric let's take a look at the",
    "next slide this is something we've shown",
    "before",
    "i believe this is cases versus testing",
    "this shows",
    "we're very happy to see the testing",
    "going up and it continues to go up",
    "but it a number of cases is going up",
    "much more",
    "obviously much more dramatically so we",
    "have some people who think that the",
    "increase in testing is what's causing",
    "the increase in cases",
    "yeah a little bit of it but most of it",
    "uh is",
    "more and more cases um so let's take a",
    "look at the next",
    "slide here um so this is number",
    "number again test perform and you can",
    "see these numbers are going",
    "way way up we're happy certainly happy",
    "about that",
    "and the positivity number the seven day",
    "running average is 12.8",
    "positivity uh the last day was 13.8",
    "so certainly not heading in the right",
    "direction",
    "so let's talk a little bit uh about",
    "building that bridge to get us",
    "across until we get uh to the",
    "point when we start uh not only getting",
    "start getting testing out",
    "or excuse me getting vaccinations out",
    "but get them out enough so that we're",
    "starting to get that",
    "herd immunity so it's a ways away but",
    "the good news is it is coming",
    "and it's great great news that we got",
    "this weekend in last week",
    "what was started down that path last",
    "week uh with our retail mass order",
    "uh we had uh inspectors go out yesterday",
    "for the first day again our goal",
    "is to protect the workers in the retail",
    "establishments",
    "also to protect customers when they when",
    "they go in",
    "it's the right thing to do with every",
    "county now being",
    "hot every county now having very",
    "significant",
    "spread the good news is that we have had",
    "some reports that even before monday",
    "when it started to be enforced uh we",
    "were starting to see",
    "a number of case number of people who",
    "are wearing masks in retail",
    "establishments",
    "uh go up and i got some emails from some",
    "folks who have been",
    "in in these different retail",
    "establishments and some of them so",
    "that's great we just encourage people to",
    "continue",
    "to do that we issue reissued last week",
    "the uh order uh that people should not",
    "come together uh",
    "you know ten or more people",
    "that has to do of course with what",
    "wedding receptions and and funerals",
    "uh again not impacting the wedding",
    "receptions or the weddings themselves",
    "the ceremony",
    "nor the funerals but uh the receptions",
    "getting together the order simply says",
    "that it has to follow",
    "basically the restaurant protocol",
    "there's a few additional tweaks in there",
    "but it's basically people need to wear",
    "masks when they're not actively eating",
    "they need to be seated they need to be",
    "careful",
    "and we think that will help when people",
    "follow that as well as we've seen a lot",
    "of",
    "a lot of tragedy come out sadly out of",
    "out of weddings and out of out of",
    "funerals and spread coming",
    "from from that what else can we do",
    "i i think really if we could summarize",
    "what we need to do",
    "it's we're a mask and have fewer",
    "contacts",
    "uh what do i mean by that well think",
    "back to the spring uh",
    "we did some shutdown people stayed home",
    "not looking anything that drastic",
    "but we know that if we reduce",
    "the number of people we come in contact",
    "every day with",
    "that we reduce the chances of getting",
    "the virus",
    "and we reduce the chances of spreading",
    "the virus if we unknowingly",
    "have it you can look back um",
    "in the spring or you can look back in in",
    "march april uh and you just saw activity",
    "went down and we're not talking about",
    "closing any businesses as we did then",
    "but what we're asking every ohioan to do",
    "is to limit your activity limit your",
    "contacts",
    "with other ohios so how we going to do",
    "that",
    "we are issuing a curfew",
    "in the curfew uh we'll start",
    "thursday uh at 10 p.m so the curfew",
    "every day",
    "for 21 days we're gonna try it for 21",
    "days see how",
    "how we're doing um for 21 days three",
    "weeks at",
    "10 pm uh retail establishments",
    "need to be closed and people should be",
    "home",
    "that will run until 5am i know a lot of",
    "people like to get up and exercise",
    "and do things that's great um",
    "we believe that this is going to help",
    "it's going to reduce some of the",
    "contacts that are taking place",
    "um what else what else can be done can",
    "be done",
    "so i'm asking in addition to the curfew",
    "itself",
    "i'm asking each ohioan every day",
    "to do at least one thing that reduces",
    "your contact",
    "with others or one thing that enhances",
    "your",
    "personal contact with someone",
    "your emotional contact with them but not",
    "a physical contact",
    "what what are we talking about let me",
    "give maybe some examples that i just",
    "wrote down today",
    "you're thinking about going watching the",
    "ohio state game with a bunch of friends",
    "don't do it pull back watch watch",
    "that at home talk about it on the phone",
    "skype in if you want to talk back and",
    "forth about it but",
    "but pull back um",
    "we're a master church again",
    "um something that people can do",
    "call a friend just talk to a friend",
    "uh lord chris is going to talk a little",
    "bit later",
    "today about some of the mental health",
    "toll that's going on during this",
    "pandemic and what people can do to",
    "to alleviate that something you can do",
    "write a letter",
    "write a letter somewhat people like to",
    "get mail they don't get",
    "a handwritten note very often give them",
    "give them that",
    "again something positive that we can do",
    "during this time something we did back",
    "uh",
    "in the spring we consolidated trips um",
    "talking to someone the other day uh they",
    "said you know",
    "in the spring i would have made one trip",
    "to the grocery store",
    "yeah this week i've made two maybe three",
    "um so you can buy the same amount of",
    "stuff",
    "we want to help help the merchants uh",
    "but",
    "make a list consolidate it these are",
    "just simple things everyone can come up",
    "with their own list",
    "so i'm i'm really asking and we're",
    "asking every ohioan to do",
    "one thing at least or two or three that",
    "cuts down the contact",
    "every single day ask what you can do",
    "for your fellow man that's what you can",
    "do",
    "for the people of ohio and we are",
    "all in this together and what each one",
    "of us does will make a difference",
    "we don't have to cut these contacts down",
    "by as much as we did in the spring but",
    "if we can cut it down",
    "say 20 percent 25 percent we're going to",
    "have a significant impact",
    "can you couple that with what we really",
    "didn't know",
    "in the spring and that was that these",
    "masks work really well",
    "and so you couple the mask with that",
    "a couple of the cutting down on the",
    "number of contacts",
    "and you know that's going to go a long",
    "way",
    "to keeping our hospitals from being",
    "overrun it's going to go a long way to",
    "keep our kids",
    "in school it's going to go a long way to",
    "keep our",
    "loved ones who are in a nursing home",
    "safe",
    "i will now go to",
    "our chief medical officer of the ohio",
    "department of health",
    "dr bruce vanderhoff doctor thank you for",
    "joining us uh and you're officially on",
    "the team and so thank you very very much",
    "for this",
    "uh the good work that you're doing i",
    "know that you and i have talked an awful",
    "lot we",
    "we talked some before you took the",
    "position but we've been talking a lot",
    "more",
    "since you took this position so give us",
    "a little perspective from a medical",
    "scientific point of view about what",
    "we're seeing in ohio",
    "right now and you know maybe some of the",
    "things that we",
    "should be looking to do and what the",
    "significance of all this is",
    "well thank you thank you governor dewine",
    "i'd like to",
    "share information about really two",
    "things",
    "the science of covid19 and how our",
    "hospitals",
    "are handling all this first let's turn",
    "to the science",
    "at the beginning of march when covid19",
    "first arrived in ohio",
    "we didn't know much about the virus and",
    "the disease it caused",
    "this science has evolved as the virus",
    "has spread across the world and",
    "today our picture of how the disease",
    "progresses",
    "is much more complete what we know",
    "is that this disease is spread mostly",
    "through the air by respiratory droplets",
    "when we cough",
    "sneeze sing talk even when we breathe",
    "we expel virus droplets into the air",
    "if an infected person is having a",
    "conversation in close proximity to",
    "another person",
    "or coughs or sneezes next to them",
    "we know now that that second person is",
    "at real risk of being infected by some",
    "of these",
    "airborne droplets fortunately",
    "what we know today is that there really",
    "are",
    "simple things each and every one of us",
    "can do to protect",
    "ourselves from these droplets we can",
    "maintain a good distance say six feet",
    "from those around us and we can wear a",
    "mask",
    "these are simple and yet very effective",
    "non-pharmaceutical interventions that",
    "accomplish",
    "three things they protect the person",
    "you're interacting with because the mask",
    "limits your respiratory droplet",
    "spreading and keeping your distance",
    "makes it harder to share the virus today",
    "we also know that the masks",
    "protect the wearer from being on the",
    "receiving end",
    "of another person's respiratory droplets",
    "and there's now scientific evidence that",
    "if you're wearing",
    "a mask and yet still or infected you're",
    "less likely to get",
    "sick than if you weren't wearing a mask",
    "i also want to comment on the importance",
    "of good ventilation",
    "as we shift to being more and more",
    "inside",
    "we need to look for ways to ensure good",
    "ventilation when we're around others",
    "so if you're going to be inside around",
    "people who",
    "aren't in your inner circle consider",
    "cracking a window",
    "in addition to wearing a mask the",
    "science is",
    "absolutely clear keeping your distance",
    "wearing a mask and good ventilation all",
    "work",
    "together to form a protective barrier",
    "against viral transmission it doesn't",
    "matter if you feel fine",
    "or you just have a mild tickle in your",
    "throat",
    "you could be asymptomatic and still a",
    "carrier",
    "be able to infect the people around you",
    "even if you feel absolutely fine",
    "that's why it's crucial that each one of",
    "us",
    "wears a mask when we're around anyone",
    "who",
    "isn't in our immediate circle",
    "now as the holidays approach these",
    "protective measures",
    "are going to be even more important",
    "it's obviously not possible to wear a",
    "mask while you're eating or you're",
    "drinking",
    "which is why we're recommending that you",
    "celebrate small this season",
    "keeping your celebrations to the inner",
    "circle of people who live in your",
    "household will help protect you",
    "and your family now i'd like to turn to",
    "our hospitals",
    "something that's important for us to",
    "know as we",
    "think about and talk about covet 19 is",
    "the trajectory of this disease and how",
    "long it may take for someone to get",
    "sick sick enough to end up in the",
    "hospital",
    "say for example i was infected with",
    "covet",
    "on monday it could take three days for",
    "the virus to make me sick enough",
    "to start showing symptoms then",
    "it could take me another couple days of",
    "feeling lousy",
    "before i decided to go to the doctor",
    "assuming",
    "i got tested and the doctor",
    "gave me a result and that result came",
    "back let's say",
    "fairly quickly in 48 hours it could take",
    "another couple of days of feeling badly",
    "before i got sick enough",
    "to say you know i need to go to the",
    "hospital",
    "once people get admitted to the hospital",
    "we need to be aware that",
    "they aren't staying a short period of",
    "time",
    "we've made great strides in the",
    "treatment of combat 19 and those",
    "advancements have in fact",
    "reduced hospital states a lot",
    "nevertheless even with these",
    "improvements",
    "a person who gets admitted to the",
    "hospital for covet 19",
    "typically will stay several days and if",
    "you're sick enough to end up in the icu",
    "especially on a ventilator your length",
    "would stay could be weeks now if you've",
    "never",
    "seen anyone who needs a ventilator for",
    "assistance with breathing",
    "you should know that it's not an easy",
    "road",
    "it can take a long time to rebound from",
    "being on a vent",
    "it's grueling and requires a long",
    "recovery",
    "even after you're breathing on your own",
    "again",
    "i speak directly with my colleagues in",
    "healthcare around the state",
    "each and every day and what they're",
    "telling me is that the situation",
    "is very serious as we look around the",
    "state",
    "every county is being impacted there's",
    "no relief valve",
    "there's no place where the virus isn't",
    "transmitting at a high rate",
    "a month ago we had a thousand people in",
    "the hospital",
    "at any given time today that number is",
    "more than",
    "3 600 and it's growing considerably",
    "in the spring we focused our efforts on",
    "conserving",
    "ppe and building physical capacity",
    "the space and the stuff for our health",
    "care system",
    "we were successful and we're in much",
    "better position today",
    "to help support our hospitals through",
    "this surge",
    "however we now face a different kind of",
    "crisis",
    "it's the people it's a staffing crisis",
    "our caregivers are in a precarious",
    "situation",
    "they're at risk of illness because of",
    "their exposure",
    "or their family's exposure outside the",
    "hospital",
    "as a result of these outside the",
    "hospital exposures",
    "some of those people some of those vital",
    "nurses and",
    "other medical staff may be quarantined",
    "or may become ill themselves",
    "many of them have been treating covet 19",
    "patients since",
    "march and they're just exhausted",
    "let me leave you with this thought",
    "we all need to do absolutely",
    "everything we can to contain the spread",
    "of this virus",
    "we're at a critical juncture we need to",
    "protect our health care workers",
    "i spoke earlier about the trajectory of",
    "the disease",
    "remember that even if we make necessary",
    "changes",
    "immediately it's going to take us weeks",
    "before we start seeing any real",
    "improvement",
    "in those hospital numbers even if you",
    "don't believe",
    "in masks please wear one",
    "keep your distance from other people and",
    "reconsider your gatherings",
    "to protect our health care workers",
    "they really need us now more than ever",
    "doctor thank you very much thanks for",
    "being with us",
    "great to have you on the team department",
    "of mental health and addiction services",
    "director laura",
    "chris is next and we're going to skype",
    "her in",
    "and lori uh you've talked to me a lot",
    "about uh what we're seeing out there",
    "with",
    "people and their mental health needs i",
    "know that as i've talked to",
    "other people across the state we're",
    "seeing that as well maybe you can",
    "help us a little bit about how to get",
    "through this and maybe help",
    "family and friends get through it yeah",
    "thank you so much governor for having me",
    "back",
    "i appreciate your attention to our our",
    "physical health and our mental health as",
    "ohioans and i know that so many others",
    "do as well",
    "this pandemic is definitely creating",
    "prolonged stress",
    "for all of us and if you're feeling",
    "stressed out you're not alone",
    "it's okay to not be okay and it's okay",
    "to ask for help and these are things",
    "that",
    "you've heard me say before you've heard",
    "the governor talk about before",
    "and it's true we've established an ohio",
    "care line",
    "so that if you want to talk to someone",
    "about your stress you can call",
    "1-800-720-9616 to connect with a mental",
    "health professional 24 hours a day",
    "and maybe you don't want to have a",
    "conversation",
    "you'd rather just text with someone",
    "that's available too you can text the",
    "number four",
    "in the word hope to 741741",
    "and you can chat via text either way",
    "you're connected to",
    "a mental health professional that's just",
    "going to walk you through",
    "answering questions that you have",
    "listening to your concerns connecting",
    "you to resources",
    "or information in your local community",
    "maybe you",
    "don't really need to talk to someone yet",
    "but there are still healthy ways for",
    "each of us to think about",
    "adapting to adversity during the",
    "pandemic and",
    "these are pretty simple things that each",
    "of us can do",
    "but they do take some attention on our",
    "part to make sure that we're",
    "taking care of ourselves so the first",
    "the governor's already talked about this",
    "uh",
    "staying emotionally connected to people",
    "that we care about each day",
    "reaching out to a friend or a family",
    "member with a phone call",
    "it helps us feel better as the person",
    "making call and it's always great to get",
    "a phone call from a friend too get a",
    "little bit of fresh air a little bit of",
    "sunlight a little bit of exercise each",
    "day that gets a little harder in the",
    "colder months in ohio",
    "especially the sunlight sometimes but",
    "getting outside",
    "and even if it's just bundling up and",
    "taking a walk around the block",
    "or doing some stretches inside near a",
    "window these are good things for",
    "us physically and then the other thing",
    "i'll just mention quickly today",
    "is prioritizing time for your",
    "spirituality or your faith",
    "spending some time in meditation or",
    "prayer",
    "is something that can really help with",
    "managing stress too",
    "so again these things sound simple and",
    "it's easy to move away from",
    "any one or all of these things on a",
    "day-to-day basis especially if we're",
    "dealing with financial struggles",
    "or missing loved ones during the",
    "holidays or",
    "supporting a school-aged child",
    "during the the learning from home",
    "but research shows that these coping",
    "strategies will help each of us deal",
    "with adversity",
    "and they help each of us build some",
    "confidence in our skills",
    "calmness in our mind and perseverance",
    "when we're starting to feel the fatigue",
    "of the pandemic",
    "and it taking place over months and",
    "months so remember taking care of",
    "yourself",
    "is a priority not a luxury",
    "and now i just want to take a minute to",
    "talk to our friends and family",
    "and neighbors who have been",
    "struggling with or recovering from a",
    "mental illness or substance use disorder",
    "maybe starting before the pandemic",
    "please keep up with your treatment",
    "keep up with your medication stay",
    "connected to your support groups",
    "if you run a facility that hosts a",
    "support meeting",
    "find ways for that meeting to continue",
    "in person",
    "in a safe way if possible and if not",
    "look for ways",
    "for people to connect virtually through",
    "social media meetings or or other",
    "connections",
    "these support meetings are life-saving",
    "so stay connected to your peers",
    "they'll help you when times get tough",
    "also we know that no matter how long",
    "someone's been in recovery from a mental",
    "illness or a substance use disorder",
    "relapse can happen under prolonged",
    "stress and so the pandemic is certainly",
    "something",
    "that can threaten relapse for our",
    "friends and family who are in recovery",
    "let's make sure that none of us are",
    "making assumptions that we're checking",
    "in with our friends checking in with our",
    "families who we know have struggled with",
    "addiction or mental illness in the past",
    "invite these family members these",
    "friends into our inner circle into our",
    "bubble",
    "to help them find ways to be safe and",
    "help support their wellness from",
    "profit 19 but also to reduce",
    "opportunities from being alone and for",
    "having a substance use crisis",
    "without support and and that could",
    "include an overdose",
    "ask your friends and family who are in",
    "recovery if they're okay",
    "encourage them to stay connected to",
    "treatment and support",
    "ask if they need help getting what they",
    "need and if they do",
    "then there's resources available you can",
    "go to takechargeohio.org",
    "or you can again call the ohio care line",
    "at 1-800-720",
    "these are simple ways that each of us",
    "can commit to supporting",
    "ourselves and one another every day",
    "during the pandemic and",
    "and beyond and remember taking care of",
    "yourself is a priority not a luxury",
    "well director thank you very much all",
    "good comments very important comments",
    "you know for example if someone is in an",
    "aaa group",
    "what you're saying is try to figure out",
    "either how to physically continue that",
    "maybe wear masks do something or do it",
    "do it uh",
    "on online or somehow keep that",
    "connection",
    "is that that's right that's right there",
    "are a lot of",
    "peer support groups family support",
    "groups that are continuing in person",
    "maybe there's fewer people they're",
    "sitting further apart they're wearing",
    "masks",
    "uh the meetings might be shorter so",
    "don't assume that a meeting is not",
    "happening reach out and find out but",
    "also",
    "online there are a number of meetings",
    "available",
    "and there are organizations that are",
    "hosting those and and they're private",
    "and confidential and",
    "secure as well great well thank you very",
    "much",
    "thanks for the great work you do and",
    "your team and",
    "folks around the state of ohio we",
    "appreciate that very very much before we",
    "go to lieutenant governor",
    "maybe just a couple more comments about",
    "the curfew because i'm sure people are",
    "saying well what",
    "what all does that mean again ten",
    "o'clock to five to five o'clock in the",
    "morning",
    "um basically want people",
    "not to be out but there certainly is",
    "always always exceptions",
    "it would not apply to those who need to",
    "go to work during those hours or those",
    "who need to be",
    "out for any kind of emergency purpose",
    "curfew is not intended to stop anyone",
    "from getting",
    "groceries or getting a meal from carry",
    "out or drive through",
    "or or delivery curfew is not intended to",
    "stop anyone from going to a hospital",
    "obviously or or seeing a doctor or",
    "getting help",
    "or treatment for medical or mental",
    "health conditions so just kind of common",
    "sense",
    "our idea is to kind of carve this time",
    "out and we know that if we all do it",
    "with some exceptions",
    "but that in and of itself will reduce",
    "some of these",
    "contacts that are that are going on so",
    "lieutenant governor",
    "we'll turn it over to you thanks very",
    "much governor",
    "uh last part people need to pay",
    "attention to that it's just common sense",
    "and lori and bruce are great a lot of",
    "great advice there",
    "uh and you know i've had lots of",
    "conversations over the last week from",
    "people who offered",
    "opinions and advice and and uh and i've",
    "just tried to to",
    "put it in perspective for them we've",
    "heard a lot of statistics it's always",
    "hard to know which ones to use but we've",
    "had we had it took us five months to get",
    "to our first hundred thousand cases",
    "and we had a hundred thousand cases of",
    "virus spread over the last three weeks",
    "that puts in perspective about what",
    "we're confronting now and",
    "and i know uh the governor and and",
    "bruce alluded to this but over the past",
    "21 days hospitals",
    "as a result of that spread have seen the",
    "increase from around fourteen hundred",
    "patients to over thirty six hundred",
    "and as a result some of those hospitals",
    "have had to slow",
    "uh have had to accommodate this",
    "increasing numbers by",
    "slowing uh postponing um some elective",
    "surgeries and",
    "and we just can't see this trend",
    "continue without it having",
    "uh a really increasingly negative impact",
    "on the way that our caregivers provide",
    "that care",
    "and so doing nothing is not an option",
    "uh it's easy to understand why though",
    "because i've had a lot of these",
    "conversations it's easy to understand",
    "why",
    "targeted shutdowns of businesses um",
    "like restaurants and phys fitness",
    "centers were were for some",
    "considered pretty unpopular and they",
    "didn't consider it",
    "a fair solution because those businesses",
    "and the people",
    "who rely on those paychecks would bear a",
    "disproportionate",
    "responsibility of the burden when we",
    "know we all know this",
    "that the responsibility for the solution",
    "lies with all of us",
    "personal responsibility and",
    "accountability and shared responsibility",
    "we don't need a shutdown but we do need",
    "to slow down",
    "for a few weeks to get this virus",
    "back into a manageable situation",
    "i often hear people asking for this",
    "balanced approach",
    "as the best approach and our challenge",
    "now is how do we reduce the spread of",
    "the virus",
    "not overwhelm our hospitals keep",

    "save jobs educate kids avoid the",

    "anxiety and stress and mental health",
    "issues",
    "addiction and abuse those things that",
    "lori chris talked about that can wear on",
    "us",
    "this is the complexity of the problem",
    "that we're trying to",
    "resolve and of all of the options we",
    "discussed",
    "with business leaders health care",
    "community leaders",
    "legislators school leaders a 21 day",
    "temporary curfew was considered the",
    "least",
    "disruption of disruptive option to our",
    "economy",
    "but also believed to have a meaningfully",
    "positive impact for our health care",
    "providers that's the balance",
    "and the majority of the opinions of the",
    "people we talked to",
    "felt the approach the governor outlined",
    "today would be the best",
    "way to go the virus spreads when people",
    "get together",
    "so for a while we need to make sure that",
    "fewer people",
    "are coming together and spreading the",
    "virus",
    "no shutdowns just a slowdown",
    "this has been hard on everyone i've",
    "talked to sons and daughters who've lost",
    "parents to covid",
    "overwhelmed nurses who care for coveted",
    "patients and",
    "don't want to carry the virus back home",
    "to their families",
    "i've talked to business owners who've",
    "closed and even more who are struggling",
    "uh and employees who've lost their jobs",
    "and those who are",
    "anxious fearful that they might lose",
    "theirs",
    "and moms who are stressed over educating",
    "their kids at the same time",
    "they're trying to work from home i know",
    "it it has been hard and it is hard",
    "but we need to get the spread of this",
    "virus under control and we can do that",
    "and we'll get through this we just",
    "do what the governor's asking us to do",
    "we're going to get through this",
    "to that vaccine that's the light there's",
    "some great news",
    "as the governor mentioned about some",
    "quality vaccine options that are on the",
    "way",
    "we've got to get through this tough part",
    "um",
    "and you know i know it affects every",
    "family and",
    "every family needs to have a plan and",
    "and i shared",
    "with the governor this morning about",
    "what our family our",
    "family plan is on sunday my dad called",
    "he and my mom are in their 80s and",
    "i know the highlight of their year is",
    "thanksgiving because it's the only time",
    "of the year",
    "where all of their kids and their",
    "grandchildren are ever together",
    "and i knew when i picked up the phone",
    "answered my dad's call he was",
    "he was he was concerned didn't know how",
    "to do it safely so we talked about it",
    "we made a family plan our families are",
    "all",
    "going to limit our exposure between now",
    "and thanksgiving",
    "we decided that we would have",
    "thanksgiving outside this year",
    "now i know that can be weather dependent",
    "so we're going to be flexible maybe",
    "it'll be the day before thanksgiving it",
    "might be on thanksgiving might be the",
    "day after thanksgiving",
    "based on whether the weather will allow",
    "us to well we'll cooperate and allow us",
    "to do that",
    "and we're gonna space everybody out have",
    "every family",
    "sit at their individual table uh in our",
    "in our normal",
    "family group but we're all gonna be",
    "together just a little farther apart",
    "than usual",
    "uh and we know that this will",
    "dramatically reduce the chance that my",
    "mom and dad",
    "will get the virus or be exposed to the",
    "virus",
    "and no it won't be a thanksgiving as",
    "usual",
    "but with the right attitude it will be a",
    "great thanksgiving",
    "and if we do it right if we all do it",
    "right that will",
    "make sure that my mom and dad get to be",
    "around for the next thanksgiving",
    "uh it will be inconvenient but we'll get",
    "through it",
    "we'll all get through this we just",
    "everybody has to have that family plan",
    "and sometimes we have to have those",
    "difficult conversations like i've had to",
    "have with my own family",
    "about how we do this and i want to say",
    "thank you thank you for all of you who",
    "will make sacrifices",

    "we know that and all ohioans now have",
    "the chance to kind of step up a little",
    "bit more",
    "help curb the spread and lower the",
    "number of patients",
    "they're in our hospitals and the icu icu",
    "units we know those are real numbers",

    "ohioans to do their part",
    "without having what we thought would be",
    "an immediate and disastrous impact",
    "on restaurants and thousands of",
    "employees that we shut everything down",
    "the vast majority of restaurants and",
    "hospitality locations",
    "in ohio they are operating safely we",
    "know that",
    "they care so much about their employees",
    "actually refer to them as",
    "their family and we know that we also",
    "love taking care of our guests so we",
    "certainly want to be safe",
    "you know months ago we started something",
    "called the ohio restaurant promise",
    "and that's where operators pledge to",
    "meet and exceed",
    "the dine safe ohio requirements you know",
    "and we've seen",
    "incredible examples all over the state",
    "restaurants they're separating their",
    "tables they're doing that six foot",
    "distancing they're placing barriers",
    "between tables and booths",
    "they're doing more extensive cleaning",
    "and sanitizing and it was already",
    "something that was critical to our",
    "industry",
    "you know they make sure that their",
    "employees are wearing their get in their",
    "mask",
    "and the guests are wearing masks until",
    "they sit down to eat and i haven't saw",
    "over the last couple weeks",

    "we're really proud of the work that's",
    "being done by restaurants food service",
    "locations",
    "and many bars you know even though many",
    "of them are facing sales that have been",
    "down between",
    "20 and 70 versus the same time a year",
    "ago",
    "and any of you that are in business know",
    "how difficult it is to operate that way",
    "at the same time they have all these ppe",
    "costs they're very significant",
    "you know i think it's important to",
    "recognize that restaurants have done",
    "everything",
    "to ensure that they're not spreading the",
    "virus and the good news is that metal",
    "experts medical experts confirm it's",
    "true",
    "the spread appears to be occurring in",
    "unregulated",
    "settings like we've talked about home",
    "parties family gatherings social events",
    "some schools and other places where",
    "individuals",
    "are not always following the advice and",
    "wearing mask as our as our doctor talked",
    "about",
    "we believe the curfew is the best choice",
    "to slow",
    "things down right now and help everybody",
    "understand it's time to be even more",
    "cautious",
    "i think it's a good decision most",
    "restaurants",
    "especially independent and family-owned",
    "ones",
    "can't survive the pandemic without all",
    "of us doing our part to control",
    "this virus you know many restaurants and",
    "small businesses all over",
    "ohio were able to take part of the",
    "paycheck",
    "protection program which was a lifeline",
    "that was funding that we got a few",
    "months ago",
    "but that money's gone now more recently",
    "governor you and lieutenant governor",
    "provided several forms of financial",
    "support including the bwc refund and",
    "we're so thankful",
    "for that those are all steps to help",
    "businesses get through this",
    "and employees however we all know it's",
    "not enough",
    "you know restaurants and food service",
    "and retail businesses they need to",
    "remain open",
    "you know we're providing food to guests",
    "at restaurants but you know that we're",
    "really stepping up and doing more and",
    "more carryout in pickup window",
    "in delivery and this is going to help",
    "ensure that as many of those 585",
    "000 people who call our industry their",
    "home that's where they work",
    "keep their jobs you know we're really",
    "also thankful for our ability to",
    "continue offering",
    "takeout and delivery past uh 10 o'clock",
    "you know we feed ohioans and we take",
    "care of thousands of essential employees",

    "with their air filtration and uh some",
    "very very",
    "uh you know really following the science",
    "on that",
    "and that's uh that's very important we",
    "we appreciate that very much",
    "thank you thanks for being with us",
    "ready to go to questions governor your",
    "first question today is from laura",
    "hancock at cleveland.com",
    "good afternoon governor uh",
    "on monday the fbi searched the home of",
    "the puco chairman",
    "samuel dazzo an indication that he could",
    "be",
    "under a federal investigation you",
    "appointed him",
    "are you continue are you comfortable",
    "with him continuing to serve in that",
    "position",
    "have you discussed the situation with",
    "him i've not discussed it with him",
    "um you know we have no indication he's",
    "under investigation or he's a target of",
    "an investigation",
    "uh you know we'll we'll wait until we",
    "find additional",
    "facts but we don't we don't have any",
    "indication of that at this point",
    "next question is from tom jackson at the",
    "sandusky register",
    "tom",
    "consider uh actually closing",
    "restaurants and bars on thursday like",
    "you had previously talked about",
    "and also does are are people going to be",
    "allowed to do",
    "carryout after 10 or does everything",
    "shut down attend well tom i missed the",
    "first part i think i got the question",
    "i'll try to answer it if i didn't answer",
    "it you come back and tell me i didn't",
    "answer it but",
    "as as far as the carryout yes carryout",
    "will",
    "will be allowed nothing",
    "no retail no place you can walk in",
    "retail",
    "uh but you could do it you could do a",
    "drive-through if a restaurant had",
    "drive-through",
    "uh you could do if they have delivery",
    "you could do the delivery",
    "you can get a pizza delivered whatever",
    "you want to have delivered",
    "so and i sort of missed the first part",
    "of the question i think",
    "governor the first part of the question",
    "is have you now",
    "ruled out closing bars and restaurants",
    "uh you",
    "because previously there was an",
    "announcement you were going to discuss",
    "that thursday",
    "yeah we looked at this and frankly we",
    "heard from you know a lot of people who",
    "work at bars and restaurants",
    "and uh you know i've always said we do",
    "we do listen",
    "i got some amazingly compelling",
    "uh emails in regard to this some texts",
    "and you know behind each worker there's",
    "a story",
    "you know there's a single mom out there",
    "who who's this is what she's doing",
    "trying to keep her family moving forward",
    "we got people with other",
    "other situations so you know every",
    "employee has a story",
    "every owner has a story as a as well",
    "so what we try to do is balance things",
    "uh",
    "but we have to take action and so we're",
    "gonna try this we're gonna do this for",
    "for three weeks uh we think that we",
    "could accomplish frankly a lot more by",
    "having this curfew than we could",
    "at closing one or two different um",
    "business sectors uh and so we're going",
    "to try this for for",
    "21 days uh this coupled with",
    "uh the mask worrying enforcement in",
    "retail which we're already starting to",
    "see some results",
    "uh it looks like people are more and",
    "more people are wearing masks",
    "uh that along with our request today for",
    "everyone not only with the curfew",
    "but to do one two three other things in",
    "a day",
    "to reduce the number of contacts that",
    "you have",
    "uh with somebody else and then we're in",
    "the mass so if we could all do these",
    "things",
    "we will avoid uh shutdowns but",
    "no one can predict the future uh i",
    "do feel very strongly that we have it",
    "within our power",
    "uh to keep our kids in school uh",
    "to keep those in nursing homes safe",
    "and as well as keeping our hospitals",
    "from being",
    "over run and not being able to serve us",
    "so we have it within our power to do",
    "that we think we have a formula here to",
    "do it to start knocking this",
    "knocking the curve down again and we're",
    "going to try it",
    "next question is from farnoosh amiri at",
    "the associated press",
    "hi governor um thanks a lot for taking",
    "the time today",
    "i do want to go back and clarify because",
    "i think",
    "you mentioned something about people",
    "still being allowed to go",
    "get groceries after 10 p.m and i guess",
    "i'm a little confused on how that would",
    "work if all retail i don't know i think",
    "gross look i don't think grocery stores",
    "open",
    "beyond 10 o'clock but if people are",
    "going in there it's probably not a high",
    "risk there's probably not that many",
    "people in there so",
    "we're not going to say you can't get",
    "groceries and we're not going to say you",
    "can't go to a pharmacy now",
    "whether it's a pharmacy open beyond 10",
    "o'clock there may be some but",
    "we're not going to tell them that they",
    "have to close someone may need",
    "a drug someone may have some reason they",
    "have to be",
    "at a at a grocery store so you know",
    "this is this is we want basically we",
    "want everybody home by 10 o'clock",
    "but there are there's always emergencies",
    "and there's always there's always some",
    "exceptions but all retail",
    "closed by 10 o'clock you can do carryout",
    "you can do delivery but all all of the",
    "retail",
    "basically that you walk into is in fact",
    "closed that should accomplish",
    "putting people at home um you know but",
    "there are a couple exceptions that you",
    "know",
    "we think make sense",
    "next question is from andy chow at ohio",
    "public radio and television",
    "andy hey governor uh so you just",
    "detailed",
    "how this order impacts businesses and",
    "how restaurants can stay open for",
    "delivery and pick up how does this order",
    "impact just everyday people like you",
    "said you want people you're hoping that",
    "after 10 pm people go home",
    "how will the health order be written is",
    "it like a stay-at-home order for from 10",
    "pm to 5am",
    "well it's gonna be similar i mean we're",
    "calling it a curfew we think curfew",
    "probably",
    "describes it at best uh i mean this was",
    "reported",
    "um you know i saw some headlines this",
    "morning and",
    "some stories yesterday that talked about",
    "a business curfew it's really not a",
    "business curfew it's curfew",
    "uh the goal is to have fewer",
    "contacts if we can take these contacts",
    "with people have with other people down",
    "20 30 percent",
    "we saw the impact it had in the spring",
    "we're not shutting businesses down",
    "but remember in the spring we had a lot",
    "of businesses open anyway some were",
    "closed",
    "we went to the essential non-essential",
    "but the whole idea is if you can",
    "slow these contacts down",
    "that's going to be go a long way to slow",
    "this virus down this virus lives",
    "only when it goes from one person to the",
    "other and so",
    "if you reduce those number of contacts",
    "that's why i",
    "ask people in addition to the curfew do",
    "something every day",
    "think what am i going to do what would i",
    "normally do i'm getting ready to do and",
    "said no i don't want to do that because",
    "that will uh you know increase the",
    "contacts",
    "and so if you just decrease the contacts",
    "we're going to be better off the curfew",
    "starts us down that path",
    "i'm asking people to do more than the",
    "curfew and we believe that those things",
    "coming together along with",
    "the mask worrying in retail we hope mask",
    "worrying",
    "throughout we'll start flattening this",
    "curve and start getting this thing under",
    "control",
    "next question is from jeff redick at",
    "wsyx in columbus",
    "afternoon governor jeff does this uh",
    "strengthen the 10 person gathering limit",
    "in other words that's not often enforced",
    "would it be more enforced",
    "under the curfew mean science behind",
    "this",
    "yeah look i mean we don't anticipate for",
    "example",
    "uh someone's driving down down the the",
    "road on",
    "you know 71 or 70 or wherever uh you",
    "know",
    "and it's past 10 o'clock we're not",
    "really anticipating they're going to get",
    "pulled over unless they're doing",
    "something else",
    "but let's say there's somebody uh",
    "there's there's a group of people coming",
    "together",
    "and it's 10 30 and they're in a park or",
    "they're someplace there's someplace else",
    "well",
    "it would be logical for police to go",
    "over there and say hey what's going on",
    "um and so that does not depend on the 10",
    "person order",
    "is a curfew and the curfew is what you",
    "know really would control",
    "if you look at the 10 person order we",
    "reissued it and the real",
    "change substantive change in there is we",
    "are very specific",
    "in regard to banquets very specific in",
    "regard to weddings funerals",
    "these gatherings after the funeral after",
    "the wedding",
    "where people naturally want to get",
    "together and that's fine",
    "but they need to wear masks they need to",
    "be careful they need to be",
    "seated and so that was not in the",
    "previous orders that",
    "is now in in the orders next question is",
    "from kevin landers at wbns in columbus",
    "well governor thanks again for doing",
    "this uh you are going to be criticized",
    "for not being tough enough at a time",
    "when cases",
    "are going up if we shut down for 21 days",
    "wouldn't that have a more",
    "dramatic decrease or impact in",
    "eliminating",
    "these cases from going up what was your",
    "driving",
    "decision as to why you didn't feel",
    "strong enough to do",
    "a shutdown well a shutdown is is rather",
    "dramatic we did it once",
    "uh doing it the second time has you know",
    "uh",
    "double the ramifications quite candidly",
    "uh some people survived uh the first",
    "shutdown won't survive the second",
    "shutdown even it's a relatively short",
    "period of time",
    "there are all the other consequences",
    "lord chris talked about the consequences",
    "that we have seen",
    "in regard to mental health um you know",
    "you do a shutdown",
    "that you increase the mental health",
    "problems",
    "um you would be saying if you did a",
    "complete shutdown nobody goes to school",
    "uh and yet we know that um there",
    "are kids who are doing well in school",
    "that don't do well outside of school",
    "and each school is making that",
    "determination we would then be",
    "overriding that",
    "and telling every school they have to",
    "close and they have to they have to go",
    "remote all kinds of cons",
    "all kinds of consequences um you know we",
    "saw",
    "uh when we looked at overdoses deaths uh",
    "in the spring they went up",
    "uh it goes back to something that lori",
    "was was talking about director chris was",
    "talking about",
    "you know people being together and we",
    "think one of the reasons those overdoses",
    "went up is frankly",
    "people took drugs they overdosed no one",
    "was there two called",
    "9-1-1 so for everything we do that",
    "distorts the economy or or changes",
    "things there are consequences and there",
    "are many times there are unintended",
    "consequences",
    "so what i had to do is balance that you",
    "know",
    "the bad things that could happen with",
    "what would be the positive things that",
    "would happen",
    "uh came up with this idea uh that a",
    "curfew could carve into",
    "that time uh cut the",
    "contacts down but the success of this",
    "also",
    "not only depends on people following the",
    "curfew",
    "but also people were a mask",
    "and seeing that mass compliance go up in",
    "some",
    "counties from 20 percent we need to get",
    "to 90 95 percent",
    "in stores we expect to see that and it's",
    "also from everyone",
    "pitching in and saying hey we can do",
    "this so we've set a goal we got",
    "21 21 days we need to knock this thing",
    "down we need to start seeing cases go",
    "down",
    "um because even at the rate we are now",
    "and we've not seen them go up for the",
    "last two or three days",
    "now it's over the weekend so you always",
    "get kind of skewed numbers",
    "but even at this high number if it never",
    "goes up",
    "anymore it's not acceptable these high",
    "numbers that we are at",
    "for 7 7 500 8 000 cases a day are going",
    "to mean a lot more deaths and a lot more",
    "people in icu and a lot more people in",
    "the hospital",
    "a lot more schools clothes a lot more",
    "virus get into our nursing homes and our",
    "hospitals be really hit so",
    "i'm counting on the people of ohio we've",
    "got 21 days let's do it let's start",
    "today",
    "let's do what we need to do and we'll",
    "evaluate it after 21 days",
    "no responsible governor would ever say",
    "i'm not never going to do this i'm never",
    "going to do that this is our attempt not",
    "to do those things",
    "it's our attempt to pull everybody",
    "together on one team",
    "not single out any particular industry",
    "but say hey we're all in this together",
    "we got to knock this thing down",
    "let's let's sprint let's do it for 21",
    "days let's see where we are and we'll",
    "evaluate it after 21 days",
    "governor um just wanted to",
    "add a couple things to the question or",
    "to answer the question",
    "um just to try to simplify this for",
    "folks",
    "is that if 10 pm comes around you got to",
    "go to work then you can go to work",
    "if you got an emergency you can go take",
    "care of it",
    "but otherwise go home and try to help us",
    "achieve the goal of reducing people",
    "who are not normally in the same",
    "household from coming together",
    "when we had these long discussions over",
    "the past week the hospital officials",
    "said look that's the goal",
    "everything that contributes to people",
    "coming together is the cause",
    "and everything that we can do to prevent",
    "people from coming together is the",
    "solution",
    "and we tested this idea of the curfew",
    "with",
    "with the business community and the",
    "hospital community",
    "the health community and they all",
    "thought this was a",
    "was a reasonable compromise to get there",
    "uh",
    "to find that balance and if people",
    "follow it it will work",
    "uh it will definitely work to help slow",
    "the number of contacts",
    "and get us to the point where we're",
    "going to be able to",
    "get this in a manageable situation again",
    "and as far as closing more down",
    "i mean we always have to remember this",
    "as a balance so the governor and i have",
    "done",
    "i don't know governor probably close to",
    "calls with 30 counties and",
    "superintendents and",
    "hospitals and local government officials",
    "and and",
    "when you do these calls you get the",
    "practical",
    "feel for the interconnectedness of how",
    "everything is in our society that when",
    "schools are closed",
    "nurses who work in hospitals don't have",
    "anybody to take care of their children",
    "how all of these things are connected",
    "and how",
    "keeping things open and doing it right",
    "benefits everyone",
    "from an economic and health point of",
    "view but we just have to own it",
    "we have to own doing this right so that",
    "we can knock this",
    "virus down get through this difficult",
    "period",
    "so that we can get to the vaccine and",
    "and to kevin's question",
    "we can do this this is this is a good",
    "compromise between all of those",
    "competing interests",
    "next question is from jesse ballmert at",
    "the cincinnati enquirer",
    "hi governor jesse my question is",
    "uh what evidence or experts do we",
    "consult",
    "to decide on the 10 to 5",
    "number um and how that will make an",
    "effect on the numbers and then the",
    "second quick question is what penalties",
    "are there for not complying with the",
    "curfew",
    "yeah we look we know we know the basic",
    "science",
    "and we had the doctors who we normally",
    "consult",
    "take a look at this and the basic",
    "science is",
    "fewer contacts fewer spread",
    "less spread so anytime that you can",
    "reduce",
    "contacts you know statistically you will",
    "reduce spread",
    "particularly when you have in some",
    "counties today",
    "when you look at the number of cases",
    "that they they have",
    "and you look at it and you say it's one",
    "out of 100 people in the last two weeks",
    "have come down with the virus in this",
    "county i mean that",
    "tells you how dangerous it is out there",
    "so whenever you can reduce that contact",
    "it matters and that's you know this is",
    "one way of doing it there's it's not the",
    "only way of doing it we could have done",
    "it other ways",
    "but it seemed to me to make sense and",
    "we ran it by a lot of different people",
    "and scientists and who",
    "thought yeah that that makes sense but",
    "look nothing is perfect",
    "nothing is guaranteed this is all",
    "depends on how you know how well",
    "we we do this so thank you",
    "next question is from laura bischoff at",
    "the dayton daily news",
    "hey laura hey governor i wanted to",
    "circle back to laura hancock's question",
    "about sam randazzo you said there's no",
    "indication that he's the target of an",
    "investigation",
    "why don't you consider an fbi pre-dawn",
    "search warrant where they carry out box",
    "loads of stuff",
    "not an indication of an investigation i",
    "mean you're a former prosecutor you",
    "oversaw bci",
    "tell us when these kinds of searches are",
    "just friendly visits",
    "look look the the fbi many times will",
    "indicate that someone's a target they've",
    "not indicated that he's a target",
    "i have no reason to think he's a target",
    "i don't know",
    "um so you know were",
    "waiting for additional information quite",
    "candidly",
    "um you know we uh i hired him",
    "uh i think he's a good person uh",
    "if there's evidence to the contrary then",
    "we'll act accordingly",
    "but i'm not going to act without that",
    "without facts",
    "next question is from jim province of",
    "the toledo blade",
    "hi governor thanks again for taking our",
    "questions um",
    "why did you settle on three weeks i mean",
    "do you anticipate that uh",
    "we would have to extend the curfew",
    "beyond that do",
    "would we have enough evidence as to",
    "whether it's working after three weeks",
    "and do you know whether this has been",
    "tried in other states and what the",
    "success rate has been",
    "yeah i've seen that some states have",
    "have looked at curfew i don't know",
    "though",
    "we've got an empirical data uh",
    "you know what has happened when others",
    "have used it it has been used in europe",
    "uh the situation in europe is different",
    "because in europe what they've been able",
    "to do",
    "when they put an earlier curfew you know",
    "earlier",
    "you could do a 60 o'clock or seven or",
    "eight o'clock",
    "when they've been able to do that",
    "clearly they've knocked businesses out",
    "and knocked a lot of employees out",
    "and they subsidize those those",
    "individuals we do not have the ability",
    "in ohio",
    "sadly to to to do that i mean we've",
    "looked at it we've looked at all kinds",
    "of options can we subsidize people",
    "and you know the federal government came",
    "through some very significant money but",
    "that money is now gone",
    "and we don't have the ability to look at",
    "that as an option",
    "so in answer to your question we know",
    "it's been used in europe",
    "uh it's been but it's used been used",
    "differently than we would be using it",
    "here",
    "because we don't have any we don't have",
    "any money and therefore we can't extend",
    "those",
    "extend those hours 21 days there's",
    "nothing magical about 21 days",
    "you know we instituted some things last",
    "week that we thought will",
    "make a difference we're instituting the",
    "curfew now",
    "uh we're asking ohioans do very very",
    "specific things or refrain from doing",
    "specific things",
    "there's much more awareness today in",
    "ohio about what",
    "the problem is as people are seeing",
    "these numbers go up as they're starting",
    "now to hear from their local hospital",
    "officials so",
    "uh 21 days is an eternity",
    "with this virus so where we are in 21",
    "days i don't know i hope we're in a",
    "better position than we are",
    "uh today but it seemed like 21 days was",
    "let's",
    "give this a run for 21 days uh we may",
    "have to take much more drastic action we",
    "don't know",
    "we may have to we may be able to get rid",
    "of the curfew we may keep the curfew",
    "you know we're going to have to judge",
    "this um you know",
    "at that time but this is long enough",
    "until we can see you know get some",
    "patterns that's long enough to see",
    "what what is going on and what the",
    "result there is of doing this",
    "next question is from james pilcher at",
    "wkrc",
    "in cincinnati good afternoon governor i",
    "wanted to circle back and",
    "get specifics on enforcement",
    "penalties who who enforces this",
    "what are the penalties and uh as an",
    "adjunct question",
    "i saw a post today from an elected mayor",
    "in this in the state",
    "saying don't listen to the tyranny",
    "have as big a thanksgiving as you want",
    "what do you say to somebody like that i",
    "know the two different",
    "ones more of a logistical question yeah",
    "well",
    "look i just i think we're at the point",
    "of this debate in this discussion after",
    "eight months",
    "that um you know the science is clear",
    "as a former colleague of mine daniel",
    "patrick moynihan once said",
    "everyone's entitled to their own opinion",
    "you're just not entitled to your own",
    "facts and i would say that to that mayor",
    "and to other people who are just totally",
    "irresponsible",
    "and want to be telling people to do",
    "things that may end up",
    "hurting them or killing them so i just i",
    "find that to be",
    "totally totally outrageous can you just",
    "follow up on the uh",
    "on the the penalties and the enforcement",
    "is it going to be up to law enforcement",
    "to enforce this and",
    "and what can they arrest somebody can",
    "they get what they're getting tickets",
    "what are the what are the penalties here",
    "yeah let me get uh i'm gonna have my my",
    "team um",
    "send in to me um the statute or the or",
    "the reference point in here",
    "and i'll get back i'll answer that in in",
    "a minute but basically we're having",
    "calls now uh our team is with with",
    "with local law enforcement um and",
    "again we do not expect law enforcement",
    "to go pull people over because they're",
    "out beyond",
    "10 o'clock but if they're seeing some",
    "something going on um this isn't",
    "this is a way that law enforcement can",
    "walk up to them and say hey guys",
    "you know you're you're here you're",
    "hanging out at this gas station or",
    "you're here or there",
    "you're congregating together and there",
    "is a curfew and why don't you just go",
    "home",
    "uh you know we're not looking for a",
    "heavy hand here and we don't want to put",
    "law enforcement in a difficult position",
    "on the other hand uh this is it is it is",
    "a serious matter and we need to",
    "we need to deal with it so i'll get back",
    "i'll answer that as soon as i",
    "get something from our team here thank",
    "you",
    "next question is from josh ruttenberg at",
    "spectrum news",
    "hi governor hi josh question for you",
    "you've used words in this very press",
    "conference like",
    "dramatic to paint the picture of the",
    "virus and common sense",
    "as far as what certain measures need to",
    "be taken",
    "and the lieutenant governor said that",
    "this was the least disruptive option in",
    "the economy",
    "um but do you have data to suggest that",
    "the majority of people are out between",
    "10 pm and 5 a.m as opposed to 5 a.m to",
    "10 p.m",
    "and if and if not why is this not being",
    "done in reverse",
    "you know josh uh excellent question uh",
    "right now i can guarantee you there",
    "there are",
    "some people who are tweeting uh and who",
    "are saying that uh",
    "dewine is a dictator and a tyrant and uh",
    "in doing this so you know we got",
    "different points of view but we wanted",
    "to see what could be",
    "least disruptive that would not cause",
    "other problems",
    "other social problems unemployment",
    "more mental health problems but could",
    "make a significant difference and no of",
    "course there's more people out during",
    "the day than there is between 10 o'clock",
    "and",
    "and and 5 and 5 a.m but there are people",
    "out at 10 o'clock",
    "and the goal is you know we we put",
    "a stop of alcohol some months ago at 10",
    "o'clock",
    "in in our bars okay",
    "then then the uh you know people said",
    "well they're congregating here they're",
    "congregating there they're doing this",
    "okay this should eliminate most of that",
    "additional congregating and that contact",
    "that occurs",
    "after 10 o'clock and so while there may",
    "not be as many people out after 10",
    "o'clock",
    "you know with the exception of those who",
    "are working and doing other things you",
    "know",
    "many many of them are out congregating",
    "together",
    "and so this should get rid of most of",
    "that",
    "uh nothing's perfect and",
    "this coupled with what we did last week",
    "on with retail establishments",
    "where we're saying you you know you",
    "unless you've got",
    "a medical reason and we resp and by the",
    "way we respect those medical reasons and",
    "somebody doesn't have a mass we should",
    "not",
    "no one should give them a hard time",
    "let's just assume that they've got",
    "a medical reason but you couple those",
    "things that we've done",
    "in the in the last um six days",
    "and we think you know it gives us a shot",
    "at this thing a good shot at it's",
    "slowing this down now we know it's not",
    "easy uh when you get spread as high as",
    "seven",
    "thousand new thousand cases a day seven",
    "new cases a day seven thousand new case",
    "a day",
    "i mean you you know it's it's hard to",
    "slow this down",
    "the faster this train goes uh and it's",
    "going pretty fast",
    "now the harder it is to slow it down but",
    "we think we have a shot at doing it",
    "without causing many other social",
    "problems",
    "that also are very very bad so",
    "i've said this before but most of what",
    "i'm doing",
    "and the choices i'm making are between",
    "two bad decisions",
    "which one's worse because one's least",
    "worse",
    "so lieutenant governor yes thank you",
    "governor uh you",
    "you hit the you hit the right point",
    "right there is that",
    "is that over the last week we have i",
    "mean look we've been doing this for nine",
    "months but over the last week",
    "we really uh we really pursued",
    "all of the available options and we",
    "talked to medical officials and people",
    "that were talking about the strain of",
    "the economy and the mental health",
    "issues and because it's not covid's not",
    "the only problem of the pandemic",
    "coven is the cause of the pandemic but",
    "it creates other problems economic ones",
    "mental health ones",
    "and and this i i know",
    "i'm convinced from the conversations",
    "i've had over the last week",
    "that this is a balanced approach this is",
    "a middle ground",
    "this will slow down enough the people",
    "that are coming together",
    "that we can impact the spread of the",
    "virus",
    "move it back to the point where it can",
    "be controlled",
    "and at the same time not cause",
    "uh a catastrophic effect in the economy",
    "and you have to care about both you",
    "can't just care about one in isolation",
    "you have to find a balance",
    "uh that's what the governor tasked all",
    "of us to do is to",
    "to to help uh with that challenge and",
    "and uh and based on all of the",
    "recommendations this was",
    "the most impactful uh with the least",
    "disruption that we could",
    "uh determine that we could come up with",
    "next question is from scott hallas at",
    "the xenia daily gazette",
    "hey scott hey governor how are you i'm",
    "wilson",
    "good um a lot of school or not a lot but",
    "there are many schools in the dayton",
    "area who are starting to go back to",
    "remote learning for the next couple",
    "weeks or even",

    "randy ludlow at the columbus dispatch",
    "hey randy",
    "good afternoon governor we're still a",
    "little unclear on the retail component",
    "of this",
    "you said retail businesses will",
    "generally be required to close",
    "what are the exemptions who can remain",
    "open",
    "and uh is dine-in permitted at",
    "restaurants",
    "past thursday no",
    "randy we'll have this in the order",

    "see it but",
    "basically it is perfume",
    "people should be home by 10 o'clock",
    "there are exceptions",
    "exceptions if you know there's some",
    "emergency some reason they need to be",
    "out and they're common they're basically",
    "common sense",
    "exceptions as far as retail",
    "um you know we're never going to close a",
    "pharmacy",
    "not going to close grocery store because",
    "they have things that some people need",
    "it late at night",
    "that someone in sick we're not going to",
    "close those",
    "as far as food no",
    "dine in nothing open",
    "but there could be delivery of pizza for",
    "example",
    "um there could be a drive-through",
    "uh order and pick something up right",
    "there",
    "so you know those things would be would",
    "be permitted",
    "uh but any any retail you walk into",
    "uh basically uh with the exception as i",
    "said of the grocery store and the",
    "pharmacy",
    "uh would be closed at ten o'clock and so",
    "it has the ability to really kind of",
    "push people more towards home and uh",
    "slow things down for for that period of",
    "time",
    "i'm sorry will dine in be still be",
    "permitted at restaurants past thursday",
    "no no dine in no dine in beyond 10",
    "beyond 10 o'clock i'm asking about",
    "during the day",
    "you had talked to closing restaurants",
    "apparently you're not going to do that",
    "dinan will be permitted prior to 10 pm",
    "yeah",
    "sure and look we we we encourage",
    "uh the restaurants have worked hard on",
    "this",
    "and you know there are a few outliers",
    "uh but you know they come under",
    "uh you know they need to have people",
    "with masks and do everything they need",
    "to do but the vast vast majority of",
    "restaurants are doing what we have asked",
    "them",
    "to do and are working very very hard at",
    "that",
    "um you know look we we encouraged uh",
    "carryout i think carryout is one way we",
    "can support our restaurants",
    "and it's a good thing",
    "next question is from desiree gosselin",
    "at wkbn",
    "in youngstown hi yes thank you",
    "um just to clarify on the last call",
    "bar rule um is that still in effect or",
    "do people need to be out of the door",
    "before tonight",
    "yeah every retail establishment will",
    "close at 10 o'clock",
    "next question is from jack windsor at",
    "wmfd",
    "in mansfield hey jack",
    "hi governor uh last week your medical",
    "experts told us that they see mass",
    "compliance being high and that shutdowns",
    "would do more harm than good",
    "um and then back on july 15th cases were",
    "already dropping when you said quote if",
    "all of us",
    "put on a face covering for four weeks",
    "six weeks we would drive this epidemic",
    "into the ground",
    "now here we are 16 weeks later and in",
    "light of that last week the new england",
    "journal of medicine military study",
    "indicated that cases were actually",
    "higher",
    "and those who quarantined and underwent",
    "strict enforcement of masking distancing",
    "and disinfecting",
    "so it appears that the masking",
    "distancing and quarantining",
    "isn't stopping the spread but we do know",
    "that it's certainly creating unintended",
    "consequences that are hurting",
    "many people but it also appears that",
    "you're not willing to come off a dime",
    "and consider different directions",
    "so my question is why",
    "well i'm going to refer to our doctors",
    "dr still on",
    "i am indeed yeah all right bruce you",
    "want to answer that to jack",
    "you know i would caution uh anyone",
    "looking",
    "at a particular study and using it as a",
    "basis for",
    "contradicting a vast repository of",
    "medical",
    "data and information it is",
    "incontrovertible",
    "that masking is effective in reducing",
    "the transmission of this virus",
    "it is incontrovertible that staying",
    "apart from one another reduces the",
    "spread of this and it defies common",
    "sense",
    "if one understands the very good science",
    "around the droplet nature of this virus",
    "and its droplet spread if one looks at",
    "the pattern",
    "of transmission across large populations",
    "it is absolutely evident that this is a",
    "respiratory virus",
    "respiratory virus not unlike the flu and",
    "that we need to do the",
    "simple common sense things our mothers",
    "taught us when we were young to avoid",
    "getting cold",
    "and flu we just have to do it in a much",
    "more serious way with this one because",
    "it is",
    "more transmissible and there is recent",
    "research showing that it has evolved to",
    "be",
    "highly contagious and i i think that's",
    "that's the story thank you",
    "next question is from adrian robbins at",
    "wcmh",
    "in columbus hi governor thank you so",
    "much for",
    "taking my question um dr vanderhoff said",
    "that",
    "we see hospitalizations as kind of a",
    "lagging indicator",
    "from what the hospitals are telling you",
    "do we have 21 more days",
    "if the curfew isn't as effective as we",
    "need it to be",
    "when it comes to how quickly our",
    "hospitals are are filling up",
    "well i'll let the doctor answer that one",
    "as well i just i'll start",
    "by saying look our goal is to set this",
    "out",
    "for 21 days if hospitals come to me at",
    "any time",
    "and say uh you know we have a bigger",
    "we have an emergency you must take",
    "additional action we're gonna",
    "you know we're gonna listen i mean it's",
    "all based on facts that are coming in",
    "uh so you know we make these decisions",
    "every day we've set this out we think",
    "that",
    "we can let this run for 21 days uh and",
    "if",
    "particularly uh if ohioans you know",
    "really get the percentage of mass",
    "worrying i'll go back to what jack said",
    "i disagree with what jack said we have",
    "some communities where mass warrants 20",
    "in some establishments but it's going up",
    "now and that's that's the good thing",
    "bruce yeah i think it's a i think it's a",
    "very good question",
    "and what i i hope",
    "um people are beginning to to gather",
    "is just what you're pointing to that",
    "this is a ship that won't turn around",
    "quickly but",
    "we should be able to see a real impact",
    "from the guidance the steps that have",
    "been",
    "advised and taken over the last week or",
    "so the masking the asking people to stay",
    "apart and now this curfew in about two",
    "weeks",
    "so a two to three week interval to look",
    "and see look for an impact is",
    "just about the right amount of time it's",
    "a reasonable window of time",
    "to look for that impact and look",
    "specifically for it",
    "on our hospitals",
    "next question is from ian cross at wews",
    "in cleveland hi good afternoon thank you",
    "governor",
    "i have a two-part question um what",
    "guarantees can you provide to assure the",
    "small business community that compliance",
    "enforcement will be applied",
    "evenly and fairly regardless of if it is",
    "a",
    "fortune 500 company or a small",
    "family-run business",
    "and secondly do large retailers with",
    "significantly more resources and",
    "customers at any given time",
    "have a great responsibility to go beyond",
    "the health order that went into effect",
    "on monday",
    "yeah give me the give me the second",
    "question again sure um",
    "large retailers you know with with more",
    "resources and more customers do you",
    "think that they have",
    "um a greater responsibility to go beyond",
    "what the health order monday",
    "um entailed",
    "well the health order is pretty explicit",
    "uh",
    "you know i think many companies",
    "certainly are already doing",
    "some of this but i've had some",
    "conversations with some of the bigger",
    "ones directly so yeah i think they will",
    "um but you know what we what we want to",
    "see is substantial mass compliance in a",
    "store",
    "uh you know we want to see uh not",
    "crowding",
    "uh and that's the responsibility of of",
    "these companies",
    "to make sure that that that happens so i",
    "think you think we're certainly going to",
    "see",
    "see that um as far as",
    "fairness and compliance look i mean it's",
    "always important to have fairness it's",
    "always important",
    "to be even-handed and the goal and we've",
    "instructed",
    "the inspectors and their background is",
    "that their job",
    "normal job is to making sure that",
    "there's a safe work environment",
    "same thing making sure there's a safe",
    "work environment",
    "we're not in a gotcha business uh we're",
    "in the business of",
    "you know if there's a problem telling",
    "the owner there's a problem telling the",
    "manager there's a problem hey",
    "this is how you fix it this is what you",
    "need to do so we intend to work with",
    "people but",
    "but people have a right when they go",
    "into a",
    "retail establishment to feel that most",
    "the people in there are going to have a",
    "mask on",
    "and if you work there you have the right",
    "to think that people come in the door",
    "gonna have a mask on too",
    "governor next question is the last",
    "question for today and it belongs to",
    "kenny bass of wchs in charleston west",
    "virginia",
    "governor thanks for stopping by our",
    "region this week it was good to hear",
    "from you",
    "in our area um i i don't want to go too",
    "far down any conspiratorial",
    "rabbit holes here but there are many and",
    "you've",
    "even referred to people today who could",
    "dismiss you as a",
    "tyrant imposing your will but",
    "i would say that there are many moderate",
    "fair-minded people in the country",
    "who have legitimate concerns about",
    "government power",
    "and the ability it has to influence our",
    "lives and so how do you",
    "help ease their any concerns they might",
    "have about",
    "what limits that you see your power as",
    "governor",
    "should be imposed upon and and how we're",
    "not sliding down this hole",
    "to where more and more things are denied",
    "or taken away",
    "whether it's good-natured or not i mean",
    "there is a constitutional right to",
    "freedom of assembly",
    "curfews i know have been proven to be",
    "held up in court under emergency",
    "circumstances",
    "but there are many who have a lot of",
    "concern and worry",
    "about this country even in the midst of",
    "a pandemic",
    "fundamentally changing in some way well",
    "kenny i think that's a very good point",

    "caution",
    "that all of us should hear who are in",
    "government uh all of us who are making",
    "decisions",
    "um you know throughout this uh",
    "we've been very clear that uh we're not",
    "gonna violate the first amendment",
    "and some people have criticized me for",
    "doing that some people have said well",
    "you needed to shut churches down i said",
    "i'm not going to shut churches down",
    "some people said you need to shut",
    "demonstrations down i'm not going to do",

    "some people have said political rallies",
    "you need to tell them",
    "you know i beg people to do things at",
    "rallies and beg people to do",
    "but but you know so there's there's a",
    "there's a limit",
    "and i think we have to have respect for",
    "our constitution",
    "we have to have respect certainly for",
    "the first amendment",
    "and i believe that we have shown that",
    "throughout this",
