afternoon everyone
we are reporting 3500
new cases today this is by far the
highest number of cases we've ever seen
uh during the entire pandemic in fact
it's about 700 cases more than our
previous high which was just a few days
ago
viruses raging throughout the state of
ohio
there's no place to hide we now only
have two counties that are yellow
and they represent only one-fifth of one
percent of our state's total population
so every county is red or orange
only five of our counties are not high
incident counties so 83 of our 88
counties are
high incident counties
since there is no place to hide all of
us
together have to come together to fight
this enemy
we have to come together to fight this
invader
we have tools to beat this virus back
and we've learned a lot during the
pandemic
the tools are very simple is more people
wear a mask
more people keeping distance washing our
hands
good ventilation when we're inside
we got to get back to fundamentals we
got to get back to the basics
i am today calling on the leaders of
each
county each community throughout the
state of ohio
to come together to create a coveted
defense team this coveted
defense team that we are asking every
community
to form is really what we need
to fight back it should certainly
include
the county commissioners mayors
local hospital leaders certainly the
health commissioner
business leaders religious leaders and
other
local leaders it should be in each
county representative
of the community i am asking the coveted
defense team in each of our counties
to assess and understand their situation
to inventory their assets in the
community
and to focus on what steps to take to
turn the situation
in their community around
because we now know what works
to fight the virus a major part of their
job will be to explain
to people in the community exactly what
is going on
in the community the state of the virus
what's going on in their local hospitals
and what steps must be taken
to slow this advance of the virus
and my team in the last three days and i
have been doing
our zoom calls starting with
the counties that were high incidence
counties and now we've moved to the
counties that are the highest
number of cases in the last two weeks we
will continue
to work down that list
i think that these calls
from my perspective have been extremely
productive
each county has committed to expanding
their working group
to include more people they have each
committed
to meet at least once a week
and they have each one a specific goal
reducing the active new cases
that are coming in each day
and i just want to say i've been so very
very impressed
by the leadership in these counties so
far we have met
with the leaders some of the leaders in
clark county cuyahoga county
hamilton county mercer allen
putnam all glaze and this morning holmes
county
we will start again tomorrow morning
with more counties but we asked the
counties
not to wait for us not to wait for
us to schedule the call
it will take a few days of course for us
to get through all 88 counties but we
ask people to go ahead
schedule your own meeting put your own
local leaders
together as one of the leaders
said to me yesterday if a tornado hit
our county
and he said has hit our county he said
everybody rallied together
we came out to help friends we came out
even if we didn't know the people that's
what we're asking communities to do
again
ohioans are great about this
i remember a few years ago a lot of
floods along the ohio river i was just
so impressed
uh that how many people came out to help
their neighbors
same way when tornadoes hit people come
out
this is a crisis that is is grave
certainly and much more widespread
than those crisis so despite the
grim data that we see today
that we'll show you in a moment
i'm optimistic because ohioans
have the tools we know what works
we always rally when we need to rally
and i'm confident that people will do
that
when people see a threat particularly to
their families
to their neighbors to their community
they come together
we can in fact slow down uh this invader
the decisions each ohioans make each day
will really determine what kind of
winter
that we have we must mass more
we must distance more we must be more
careful
we must wash our hands more we must have
more ventilation
inside particularly as we move more
inside
as winter approaches we can
control our own destiny
eric let's look at the numbers as you
will see
um today we have as i said
set another record as we report 3590
cases
uh this is the first time we've
surpassed 3 000 daily
cases per day to put that in perspective
today's new cases
our figure is about 25 higher than the
second highest date which we reported
just last saturday
it's not only the case numbers though
that are increasing
we also have 192 new hospitalizations
reported in the past 24 hours
this is the third highest we have ever
reported
the top five highest new hospitalization
numbers have all occurred in the past
week and a half so we continue to
to be very high let's look uh eric at
the next slide
this is all 88 counties reported
by highest occurrence starting putnam
all the way down during
what you see here in the blue of course
are these the high incident counties
so as i said before 83 of our 88
counties are
high incident counties again this is
what
the federal government how the federal
government
determines it a hundred cases in two
weeks
based on 100 000 population
uh let's go to the next slide again this
this again tells us
um we have putnam county at nine times
the
um high incident level all glaze about
about five times homes about five times
and
just all the way down you can see these
top these top counties
uh the bottom of this 20 the 20th
green county it's about three times the
high incidence so we're seeing this in
mid-sized counties we're seeing in small
counties
and we're seeing increases in our urban
counties as
well let's turn to the alert system
uh we're seeing no counties uh go purple
that is the one bright spot and i'll
talk about that
in in a moment uh we no longer have a
purple we don't have any purple counties
and no
counties on our watch list
however this virus is spreading as you
can see significantly
throughout the state so we're down now
just to
two counties eastern side of our state
that are yellow
everything else is red or orange and
just shows the gravity of this
spread today we have 43 red counties
only two yellow counties
this is the highest number of red
counties lowest number of yellow
counties we have seen to date
our new red counties ashtabula all glaze
clermont defiance and trumbull this is
an increase of five counties from last
week
and two actually you know all glaze are
red for the first time
this week 78 percent of ohioans are
living in a red county
78 of ohioans are living in a red county
less than one percent as i said are
living in a
in a yellow yellow county
now let me talk for a moment about the
three counties
that drop from the watch list to red
um
our system is designed
to something the county goes to purple
it has to continue to accelerate it has
to continue to go up
what we've seen with
clark county and hamilton basically is
that they plateaued or did not see a
significant
increase and not a significant enough
increase to move to the purple level
but we're still seeing with these
counties very
very disturbing trends as i said our
alert system is designed to flag
indicators that are getting worse
what we're seeing is these three
counties have plateaued at high levels
in cuyahoga county outpatient emergency
visits are in an elevated plateau
hospital missions have been increasing
clark county emergency visits and
hospital missions have plateaued an
elevated level
outpatient visits are still high
hamilton county outpatient visits and
hospital missions are an elevated
plateau but cases continue
to go up
during the past month the average age of
cases uh in cuyahoga county the age of
the individuals uh in qatar clark and
hamilton counties has moved from people
in their early 40s to people in their
late 40s so we'll continue to see
an increase in the age or the average
age if you recall back in june july when
we saw that
in significant increase that was really
led by a younger
by a younger younger group
in quahog and hamilton county's cases
continue to rise steadily and
hospitalizations remain elevated
clark county local health department
officials told us today they're seeing
alarming increases they have recorded
271 cases during the past seven days 271
during the past seven days
hospitalizations are at a record high
and they've had 41 deaths
41 deaths in clark county in october
their previous high for deaths was 17 in
august
[Music]
what we see in these counties is similar
to what we're seeing in the rest of the
state case numbers are continuing to go
up
healthcare utilization is trending
upward
we've been sharing stories uh about
where we see
spread and i talk to the health
directors every
every monday morning and they share some
stories with me they also share some
stories
with our staff
a high school football team had 13
players with kova 19.
a couple of players were infected spread
it to the other members of the team
the spread mainly happened at informal
gatherings of the team
where there were more interactions than
there should have been
these were not regular team functions so
again this is similar to what we're
seeing
in the adult world where it's not as
much in
you know look there's spread everywhere
and but most businesses we're not seeing
much spread
uh same way with with schools but we're
really seeing
uh the spread is just the the personal
interactions the more informal
settings
another example we learned about an
outbreak among staff at a doctor's
office
as a result of non-compliance not worry
mask
staff members at the doctor's office
were either not wearing masks or
not wearing them correctly finally we
learned about a funeral at the end of
september that now has 19
cases 19 individuals who have covered
associated with that funeral
17 of the cases were identified with a
funeral in two cases where secondary
spread one of the points we discussed
on our call in holmes county this
morning
was that most things we can do um
you know fran i've been to three
funerals that were that were safe
uh uh certainly as far as we could
observe everything was done right
um you know weddings can occur many
things
we can continue to do but it's just how
we go about it
that we have to be have to be careful
about
i spoke with hamilton county leaders
yesterday and
on that zoom conference meeting
we heard from dr rick lofgren about what
they're seeing
in the hospitals in the region dr
lofgren
has been on here before he's a zone lead
for the southwestern ohio region of her
pandemic response team he's president
ceo of uc health the university of
cincinnati's affiliated healthcare
system
he also is an internal medicine
physician who has also worked
in kentucky wisconsin pennsylvania
minnesota and michigan during the span
of his career
doctor thank you very much for being
with us again appreciate it
thank you governor and i appreciate
having an opportunity
to speak you know as you mentioned we
have seen a decisive increase in the
number of covet 19 cases
and an increase in hospitalization in
our region
you know we did a great job as ohioans
suppressing the spread of this virus
through the summer and into the early
part of the fall
we were opening up our activities and i
like
and really what we were seeing at that
time is really the opportunity or the
scene across our community sort of hot
spots was a facility or an area a
specific group
that we were seeing some cases we were
able to get resources around that and
actually bring it down
however the last three weeks as you
mentioned we've seen a rapid increase
in the number of cases and
hospitalizations that's been nearly
doubling every two weeks
and it to the hospitalization at a level
like we've never seen before
and i think that one of the things
that's really notable i think is that
unlike what we saw before this spread is
diffuse
there's no one particular area no one
particular group or facility
that really accounts for the increased
number of cases i might also say that we
used to see much more in the
highly dense urban core that's not the
case anymore we see it up in the suburbs
and in the
in the entire area and as you mentioned
before we're also seeing a
increase in our positivity rate in all
the different age groups
you know not that many weeks ago our
positivity rate
in hamilton county and in the various
age groups is right around three percent
for right now we are seeing positivity
rates in every one of our age groups
somewhere between five and six and a
half percent all of which has really
happened in the last
three weeks you know our as you
mentioned i think our businesses have
really done a nice job of of adhering to
safety guidelines and keeping the work
environment
safe and our schools have done i think a
remarkable job
as you said before is that they really
have had really remarkably few
positive cases as we adhere to those
standards that we know work
we know what keeps this virus on at bay
it's there if you let your guard down it
spreads
and so it really appears that the vast
majority of the spread is really
occurring in
private social events i think we're
simply letting our guard down
we all have cove fatigue
we but we know it works you know and
i think we're starting to see people
expanding their bubble
um you know you need to ensure that
there's a small category of people who
you live with
but we all are social animals we want to
increase our bubble and i think people
are
sort of letting their guard down and in
some respects
um sort of believe that well if i know
you and you're a friend of mine
you know i can let you in my bubble and
you're really not at risk
where in fact we need to recognize that
if we expand our bubble
you're increasing your risk at any given
point in time we don't know who amongst
us
may be actually infected without
symptoms and inadvertently spirit
spreading the virus
and so that we need to go recognize
particularly as we start to go indoors
because before we can do some of these
social events outside
that we really need to maintain those
steps that we know to work
when you're going to increase your
bubble having somebody into your home
you need to maintain the social
distancing
and you need to wear a mask you know you
need to recognize that anybody who's
new into your environment may
potentially be infected
i think this is going to be a particular
challenge as we start to think about the
holidays
we're all going to be delighted to see
some relatives and friends that we
haven't seen before but we need to
understand
that way which we celebrate has to
change you know
in that if you're going to bring people
in your into your environment you have
to maintain social distancing you have
to
maintain uh the masking and all those
things that we know that work
and are effective as we move forward um
so sometimes i get asked about testing
before events and it's certainly nice to
know whether or not you are
negative before an event but it's also
not a reassuring assurance
you know i could be tested today and be
negative and then be cook
be percolating the virus within me
go into somebody's bubble and
inadvertently spread the virus
so i think the message to our community
and to each other into ohio
is that we've learned a lot in the last
six months we've learned what's
effective in terms of keeping this
the virus under control we really have
seen our organizations and our community
responding in the businesses
and the things that they're doing in the
schools
and as you mentioned the football story
it's not the formal events where we take
these measures where we're seeing the
spread
it's the informal events that happen
that we really start to let our guard
down
so i think one of the messages that i
think is important as we see
this marked uptick throughout our
community is that we really need to
recommit
and understand that we need to maintain
our exposure and our bubble we have a
small cadre of nuclear people that we
live with
and we realize that anybody else who
comes into it we just need to
treat them like even a stranger keep
your distance
wear your mask wash your hands and
sanitize your environments
doctor thank you very much we appreciate
all you're doing and
thanks for that summation of what where
we are today
thank you very much we appreciate it
it goes without saying that the pandemic
has changed
all of our daily routines but for
children with
developmental disabilities these changes
can be extremely disruptive
to their learning and to their
development many children can struggle
with remote learning
but children with ieps are often also
losing needed in-person support
such as individualized instruction
behavioral support
occupational therapy to assist children
families with ieps who are
doing remote learning we are launching
learning
aid ohio a supplemental tutoring program
starting on monday eligible families can
apply for up to fifteen hundred dollars
in grant funding
to cover costs of tutoring and other
needed supports
to apply for a grant or to sign up as a
provider visit
learningohio.comlearningohio.com
ready for questions our first question
today is from laura hancock
at cleveland.com
hi governor hello hi um
my question is um you've you've pointed
out some anecdotal data
about like the football party um
football teams and formal parties but
how can you say
that this ongoing surge stems from
private informal gatherings among family
and friends
the actual types of events where contact
tracing is easier
than other places such as bars when you
have no empirical data to back that up
have you made any kind of renewed effort
to find out
other than just tweaking last week from
the contact tracing system
yeah i mean we're going to we're trying
to get better
better data the old system was not
designed the system is not designed to
drill down on in a pandemic to find out
where the spread is
so i think we explained last week
exactly
you know what what we have we have
antidotal notes
that are coming in from tracers and so
we're going to try to
bring about some consistency but even
then
even then let's say
someone has got the virus
you're on the phone with them the tracer
is on the phone with them
and they say i was in a bar uh one night
he was in a restaurant the next night
i was at work today i was here here here
here so all that person would write down
is all those different things and you
still are not going to know
where they got it so you know unless
it's a big super spreader event
many many times it is impossible to know
for
sure but what
we rely on is some of this what we're
hearing
from the health directors they are the
ones that are out there 113
different different organizations out
there
they're the ones who are monitoring and
watching it every day
this is what they tell me because i'm
not out there
i'm not making the calls dr lofgren
uh what he just said
which was the same thing and
other doctors are telling us that as
well doctors who are treating covert
patients are telling us
this is where we are seeing the spread
this is what they're telling me
so we're never gonna please don't
misunderstand what i'm saying i'm not
saying there's not spread in
workplace i'm not saying there's not
spread in schools i'm not saying there's
not spread in bars
but what i am saying is
a big component part of this
according to everybody who is dealing
with it every single day
front line people they are describing
these informal
get-togethers and these informal events
and the big spreader
the big big spreader ones
funerals weddings big get-togethers um
you know that's what we're that's what
we're seeing so all we're trying to do
all i'm trying to do for the people of
ohio is report what we're hearing
as we talk to the people who are on the
front line
next question is from ben schwartz at
wcpo in cincinnati
hey ben hi governor um with this
kovid defense team that you're calling
on community leaders to create
what do you expect to see from it and
have you thought about the next steps
if this defense team is not able to
control the spread of the virus
yeah i mean look this then this is one
more thing that we think is is important
now
some communities are already have this
they may not call it that
uh you know different communities are at
different stages
of battling back but my experience in
life
has been in my experience in politics
and government in ohio
is things happen at the local level
and somebody at the local level
who might not think they should wear a
mask
is a lot more likely to listen to a
neighbor than they are to me
uh or to they are to dr fauci or they
are to the lieutenant governor or
or or our health director so you know
engaging people in the local community
um
and one thing that you know we've tried
to do on these calls so far and we're
just
you know not too far into these calls
but
um you know a lot of communities are
doing a good job
we try if that community has a hospital
uh you know we want to get that that
head of the hospital or some
representative of the hospital
in that call because they can really
give a good indication
here's what we are seeing in real time
that's coming into our hospital
and you know while we do not want to
imply to anyone that our hospitals are
overflowing
because they're not but the hospitals
can give you a good good read and
they're all seeing
an increase in what you know what is
coming in or basically most of them are
so pulling those people together to be
communicators to the community
pulling those people together to say hey
do we have a problem in the nursing home
with
not enough ppe okay let's go call dewine
let's go call the
the governor's office let's call the the
health department if we've got a problem
here a problem there
you know that's how we we see this group
and as i said different counties are at
different levels some are some are up
here some are here
but all everybody we've talked to so far
wants to help wants to be involved and
so this is not not magic we're not
saying this is going to solve the
problem
but we can't win this we can't push back
the virus unless we're all engaged
you got to do it next question is from
jim otte at whio in dayton
hey jim hey governor good afternoon
given the numbers out today
and the steady increase that we've seen
over the last couple of weeks what's
your prescription whether it's you or
the doctor prescription for families
who still insist they're on the uh still
planning on having a hollywood
uh a halloween get-together this weekend
the weather's going to be terrible
outside
so they're going to have this halloween
gathering inside
despite what you've said in the past
perhaps with the new numbers help
convince them to do otherwise
well halloween parties are fun but they
make no sense this year
we'll save it till next year um that's
not what anybody wants to hear
but look thanksgiving's got to be
different christmas has got to be
different
uh we're already starting to think in
our family how we're going to do it
ohio's ohioans you know
are resourceful we'll figure out how to
do these things but
it's everywhere as dr lofgren said and
the difference today is used to have hot
spots you say okay here's a problem
here's a problem here's a problem
today you know it is just spread
and you know it it's just
it's everywhere and it is advancing at a
very
fast pace we've got to slow it down
so we can't be doing things like
halloween parties
we could carefully do trick-or-treat if
we're careful
how we go about it you know we can do
most things
but we can't do them the way
we've always done them in the past
next question is from john reed at
gangwar news service
good afternoon governor there have been
reports um around the country for months
about people getting what
they're calling long covid where they
have symptoms serious symptoms for
months
um has the state collected any data on
how many people in ohio have that and
maybe
for uh for the doctor if he's still on
have we seen that what's the prevalence
of that
yeah i don't know if dr lofgren is still
on uh eric or not
to be available yeah i am um okay
and i don't have those numbers right in
front of me so i can't give you this
percentages
but this phenomena of what's being
called long haulers is very real
i think one of the things as we learn
more about the virus
is that the small percentage of people
who get the virus even if they survive
it
has this an intense inflammatory
response it's the inflammation
that it triggers that can cause a lot of
of ongoing problems
including the the infection of the heart
called myocarditis kidney problems
in in inflammation of other organs
and there's definitely a cadre of
individuals who
six nine months plus later still have
problems with fatigue
low grade fevers and recovering and
speaking to my colleagues around the
country this is enough of a
of a ongoing phenomena that people are
starting their what they call
long-haul or clinics where they're
really getting people together to really
help support them
uh through this recovery period so
it's not always a very simple recovery
it isn't a
large number of people but there are
definitely cadre of people who really
manifest ongoing symptoms for months
later um
and we need to know a lot more about it
and
unfortunately i don't have a percentage
about it it's it's not common but it's
it's definitely a phenomenon and doctor
is it my understanding that we really
don't know
why some people react that way and why
some people
don't or most people don't yeah you know
one of the things i've i've said is that
since the on the introduction this virus
in this community we've learned a lot
and we have a lot more to learn um and
so i think that
the science and my colleagues the
research are doing is phenomenal but
you know it really is um unclear why
somebody will have an infection and
really not have any problems whatsoever
and another group of individuals will
have this intense inflammatory response
that can be
caused multiple organs to damage it up
to and causing death
um so we've gotten some more insights
into it but there's a whole lot more to
learn
good thank you doctor thank you
next question is from jack windsor at
wmfd in mansfield
hey jack hi governor um
since it's clear that even though cases
have increased 400 percent
uh there has been an uptick
uh in in actually i think you just said
not an uptick in covet hospitalizations
um we continue to see uh hospital
utilization drop overall
over the past two weeks inpatient bed
occupancy dropped from 71 to 67
icu from 66 to 63 and then ventilator
usage is about flat
is this evidence that our health care
system is not at risk
and as deaths are not increasing that we
need to continue to restore freedoms
get people back to working on site and
kids back into school buildings full
um it appears that it's fear at this
point it's killing our businesses and
people more than the virus
well let's let's go with the facts i
mean we know uh
i'm gonna have dr lofgren again to
comment about what they're seeing in
cincinnati but
um you know we know that the number of
people in the hospital
today is double
people in the hospital from covet is
double what it was
three four weeks ago dr lofgren you want
to address that what you're
actually seeing in the cincinnati region
yeah thank you um just as you said i
think that
one of the things that i really look at
frequently to really understand the
burden of the disease
on our community is really the number of
people not infected but also affected to
the point that they require to be
hospitalized
and we have seen a decisive increase in
the number of individuals
in our community who have been
hospitalized in our region in the latter
part of september we had about 90 people
in the hospital who were head covered
today we have i think it's about 260
individuals who are hospitalized in our
in our hospitals um we've also
recently seen a real uptick in icu as
well
um you know one of the things i do think
is the case is then
is that we are more effective in
treating the infection we know a lot
more about how to treat patients now
than we did six months ago so i do think
that we're doing a better job in terms
of
uh preventing them to really to prevent
some of the progression
definite uptick in in terms of
hospitalizations definite uptick in
utilization
within our region you know we are
able to accommodate the current volume
of patients but if they were to
continue to double or triple from that
number you know it will start to squeeze
out non-covalent care
thank you next question is from marty
schlayton at the ohio capitol journal
governor how are you today i'm good sir
um
as you've outlined i think that most
people agree that the numbers look
really grim and uh you know last week
you
said that this idea that just because
we're doing more testing that's the
reason we're seeing more cases is just
nuts but like you just said to my
previous question earlier let's go to
the facts uh
donald trump's one of the people who's
out there saying that
the reason we got more positive cases is
because we're doing more testing
he went to circleville and uh said that
the media will stop reporting on
coronavirus on november 4th and he
jokingly talked about going out in the
crowd and
kissing everybody and so you know we're
right before election day and i wanted
to ask you
who do you think is better suited to
deal with this uh coronavirus problem
donald trump or joe biden
oh a good political questions though
look
i i i said this yesterday um
on tv i was on but
look i think the president has not
gotten enough credit for what he's done
in regard
to making a decision very very early to
invest
real big money uh into the drug
companies
for them to do the research that they
needed to do
we don't know when that's coming but we
hope it's coming
soon and that i think will make a huge
huge difference you know if you look at
the cases
we are testing more there's absolutely
no doubt about it look at the numbers
from yesterday
even before they fill in they fill in
for the next few days
as it keeps coming in but you know fifty
thousand tests
uh now look i'd love to double the
testing i'd love to have it a hundred
thousand
but uh at you know fifty thousand
certainly we've been able to
increase the average testing that we're
doing in the state of ohio
so testing in and of itself will
increase cases
but uh it's not nearly uh
you know the increase we're seeing in
positive cases
does not is not caused solely by the
increase in just
testing and the way we can tell that is
the positivity number
you know normally when we started off
and we were only testing we say oh we're
only going to test you
if you have symptoms well you know
we got away from that and so we've said
we're going to basically test anybody
today which is the right thing to do in
my opinion and we made that decision
several months ago
so when you go from only testing
positive
excuse me only testing people who have
symptoms
um you know obviously the numbers are
going to be higher there
but what we're doing now is you know
throwing that net
in a much broader group and the numbers
positivity numbers should be coming down
they haven't been coming down they've
been going up they went from two and a
half i think
i looked today number the last number i
saw is 6.9 for one day
or 6.8 or 6.9 for one day and that's a
far cry from two two and a half percent
so the positivity numbers should be
going down
instead they're going up like a rocket
every day so
it's not you know that's not why we're
seeing more
more more more positive cases
next question is from justin dennis at
mahoningmatters.com
the governor uh thanks as always for
keeping us informed
you begged for mass squaring earlier
this week and last week
and today we've now far surpassed a
state record of new cases
last week you said quote government
cannot mandate unless we're in china
or some totalitarian state but we have
seat belt laws we have no smoking laws
and the enhanced gun penalty laws you
want less about enforcement and more
about changing behavior
uh you said last week quote it's time to
get serious so my question is why can't
you
and the ohio legislature get serious and
approve a law to mandate mask
enforcement in public
who lacks the will to get that done you
or the legislature
well you'd have to ask the legislature i
think you have a
pretty good idea the answer to that
question that question
look ohioans have been able to
dramatically increase mass warring and
we saw this
back in july when we put we have a
statewide
let me just say it very clearly we have
a statewide mass order on if you're out
in public
you need to have a mask on now we do not
have a mass
police and we've had some police
departments that obviously don't want to
enforce that health department's overrun
with work and really not in a position
to do that so we rely
on the goodwill of the people of the
state of ohio
as we rely frankly on them for most
compliance with with regulations or most
laws
and so we saw a dramatic increase
in mass wearing in july in our urban
areas
and it went from we we don't know
exactly but
it would appear it went from something
in the 50 percent
somewhere in the 90 85 90
and when we saw that we saw cases go
down we can do this again
um and that is the most effective
the most efficient and frankly the only
way
uh that we're going to see uh
knock this these number of cases down
we've got to see more masks worrying and
ohioans have proven they can do it
before
we don't have the ability uh to have a
mass police
everywhere and you know we rely on
the goodwill the people of ohio and i
think the more people learn about the
more we learn about
the power of these masks and what masks
have done in the past and i think as
people see
community by community what is
doing and will be doing to their
community i think we're going to see
mass compliance and wearing go up
next question is from joe ingles at ohio
public radio and television
good afternoon governor um about
election day you've said that
local police will respond first to
polling places if there are
problems and then the national guard
could go in
but potential problems can happen
quickly on election day
so and we've heard a lot of problems
lately
with um people's tempers getting out of
line
over politics we we have numerous
examples of that
you put a lot of people together on
election day in a line that could be
problematic
so is the response enough
and is it going to be fast enough to
actually deal with problems at the polls
on tuesday
well we have a long history in this
country
uh of having fair and free
elections and peaceful elections
we've done it for over 200 years we've
done it exceedingly well
um are there people out there that might
want to disrupt something yeah sure
i mean we know that um 6 30 this morning
i was on a conference call
with our team with the national guard
the highway patrol
and others just kind of going over what
what we know
and what plans that we have
according to the ohio revised code the
sheriffs have a unique role
a unique role if there is a problem
inside inside
the flag area
the local if there's something outside
the flag area then of course the
the depending on where that is if it's
out in the county then it's the sheriff
it's
if it's the municipality village city
uh then it's up to the local police
department so they're they
they would be the first responders but
you know we're all tied in
uh with communication and
you know we basically have a war room
and
if we need to do things we will we will
do them
uh but you know the first line of
defense is a local government state the
first line of defense
is the local police local sheriff
we have the highway patrol to back up we
also have the national guard
and so again the national guard is
limited by federal law
into what they correctly into what they
can do
uh particularly around elections but uh
you know i we are ready um
and we do not you know we have a long
history
of running good elections in this
country in this state
and i think people you know should have
confidence they can go to the polls they
can have confidence they can go
and to board elections today or
you know they can continue they can vote
by absentee ballot
next question is from jeff redick at
wsyx in columbus
jeff afternoon governor um it was just
looking over
some of the numbers for example the
testing
is approaching the highest positivity
rate
since i believe july 16th
still on quite an upward trajectory
um and you've talked about that there's
no sign of a plateau
in sight you talk about the goals for
mask wearing and things some people do
like to
very seriously look at the numbers for
themselves so what would signal a
plateau what are we shooting for
numbers-wise that shows that a plateau
is coming
well i think plateau by definition is
means you stop going up
and you're not going down um you know we
had a plateau in cases for quite a
period of time around a thousand cases a
day but we didn't like it having a
thousand a day
but at least it wasn't going up so i
think that's a minimum what i've
challenged the counties to do
um as i said we started in these
conference calls we've been having we
started with the high the most high
highest incident counties and we said
look
set a goal to knock these numbers down
and start taking start taking them down
so that uh you know when you look at
them every several days
those numbers in the last two weeks are
going down
there's no reason uh the county that's
at 500
you know five times the the high
incident level the cdc there's no reason
that by good adherence to
to good practice and getting back to
fundamentals and putting masks on
you know if you if you if a county goes
from 30
wearing mass to 60 i will guarantee you
those
those cases will start down and we've
just seen it time after time so
i think every county i'll set a goal and
say look here's
what what do we think we can do and the
goal should not be to plateau
of course the goal should be to start
taking those taking those numbers down
and we know what works this is not
rocket science
this is not difficult you know we know
what works we just got to do it
and i think trying to look at
88 counties one at a time and local
community
getting directly involved and as i say
many of them
have great leadership they've been
directly involved but every county being
involved in every county having a group
that is that is fighting i think is the
way to knock this down
or at least one of the ways to knock it
down next question
jackie borchardt at the cincinnati
inquirer
good afternoon governor um you mentioned
the other day that
if we keep on this trajectory things
might shut down on their own
businesses will close schools will close
um
there's no stimulus or extra
unemployment compensation in sight
are we prepared to support ohioans
through this third and greatest surge
and what is your plan for ensuring that
safety net is there this winter
well as you know we put out five billion
dollars yesterday as i'm absolutely
unprecedented
uh going out to businesses all over the
state of ohio
to help keep them open in some cases
you know they decide how to spend the
money but um
keep people working uh so that five
billion dollars we think is important
uh doesn't solve certainly solve every
problem uh i'm optimistic
that uh congress will after this
election in a lame duck session come up
with
an additional bill to help um
but you know the the best way for us
to help people economically
is for this state to keep working
and the biggest threat to work the
biggest threat to being in school
is the virus i've talked to
superintendents in the last week
who have had to pull back for a week
two weeks a few days because of the
virus
and so an understanding
all of us understanding that the safety
of my grandmother a grandmother in
a nursing home depends on keeping the
community spread down
the ability to keep that school open
depends on that as well
and the ability to go into a hospital
and be treated as you can today for a
heart attack or
whatever the medical problem is you know
our hospitals are not overflowing
they're open but that it
would be threatened if this spike
continues to go up and at some point
you'll start seeing hospitals saying we
can't do electric surgeries
we can't do this we can't do that so a
lot of this will simply happen
organically
if these cases continue to go up and we
continue to see hospitalizations go up
and we continue to see
deaths next question is from kevin
anders at wbns in columbus
well governor judging by today's cases
it seems
very clear that the masked message isn't
working i know it worked in the past but
it doesn't seem to be working now and
i'm wondering if the message
is getting muddled because we don't have
a health director directly speaking to
the people of ohio
every day about this serious issue it
seems like the state's strategy now is
to
sort of hope for a vaccine and we all
know that hope is not a plan
so what more have you thought about that
you can do have we run out of ideas what
is the strategy moving forward
thank you yeah i mean our what we
started to do this week some of you
reported
you know as a new plan i didn't look at
it quite like that but that was
that's fine uh you know was was really
drilling down
county by county and as we have these
calls
you know sometimes we're finding hey
somebody needs this
health department needs this nursing
home needs this
so but really it is about getting
neighbors friends leaders in that
community
saying hey we don't want our county
ripped apart
we don't want our lives ripped apart we
want to keep our kids in school we want
to keep working
and so giving that that support
um i think you know will in fact make a
difference it's one more thing one more
thing that we can certainly
certainly do so uh look we're going to
continue to
um look at different things that we
might be able to do or that we can do
and we're going to
we're going to do those but
you know so much of this comes down to
what people do in their own individual
lives
where government cannot really interfere
and unless you're in a totalitarian
state
and i don't think we want to be in a
totalitarian state
so it is people of good will coming
together understanding the facts and
taking action to save their own lives
lives of family members in their
community
governor next question is the last
question today and belongs to farnucha
miri of the associated press
hi governor um so with the number of
cases rising
at an alarming rate that you outlined
here today there's a concern among
voters about showing up to the bulls
both on election day
and in the days leading up to it um what
would you tell voters concerned about
the infection
rate in ohio yeah yeah i mean i think i
think if you feel that you can go to the
grocery store you ought to be able to
feel you can go to vote
what i think i would do is try to
determine
you know what is the time of day
that um the least crowd will be there
um that's what i would if i had just you
know if i had the discretion
uh you know if you could pick a time
let's say someone is retired and they
want to vote in person
they can certainly do that it looks like
maybe over half the people in the state
who are going to vote will have voted by
election day
so that means when you walk into your
precinct
or precincts where some precincts may be
are together you know those are the only
people are going to be coming to that
polling place
so i know we're seeing a lot of long
lines with boards of elections but
that's only one polling place in the
whole county and i'm not discouraging
people from going
today tomorrow any this weekend that's
great
but if people want to wait until
election day you're going to have
already half the people voted
and so there's going to be fewer people
but i think being careful wearing a mask
you know keeping a distance if there is
a line standing back
respecting where that other person is
get in and vote
and leave you know i think that is you
know just as safe as
is going to a grocery store and and some
of the other things that you know people
do
so we end today i want to introduce you
to an ohioan who is one of our
state's heroes of hope
master sergeant smith is one of 60 ohio
national guard and ohio military reserve
members who are helping with cobia 19
testing around ohio
which since june they've done in 151
sites to find a site near you go to
coronavirus.ohio.gov
and let's take a look at the video
are you doing today i'm master sergeant
josh smith i
work as a speech therapist at the
beginning of the year
uh but with the pandemic heading i ended
up starting work as a nurse
based off of the training that i got in
the air force and then in may i was
activated
to work and do this covid testing for
the national guard
the 10 seconds each nostril with the
guard we have
people who are all throughout the
community
all walks of life we have people who
work in construction we have
your nurses your emts students at osu
all coming together putting down their
current life
to come and help out their communities
help out their neighbors
they're raising their hand to work with
the guard to help
out when they're most needed so results
take about two to four business days
i've traveled to all corners of the
state from toledo down to portsmouth
we're here in cincinnati today i've been
as far east as gallipolis
been all over the state doing testing we
put in long hours
we often say that we're making the best
out of a bad situation
we're all reacting to large amounts of
stress
constantly changing environment and i'm
seeing a positive attitude
every city town and village i've been in
it's been heartening seeing how much
everybody
has risen to the occasion not just the
members of the military but
our community partners local health
boards
even the private businesses have come
together with us
and it's worked as one large team rather
than
dozens of disjointed and fantastic if
you do have a positive result you'll be
getting a call from the health
department
this has been probably one of the most
exhausting
stressful and rewarding moments of my
career in the guard
to be able to say that i raised my hand
and said
i will help when ohio needed me the most
i can say i was there
and i helped i did my duty for my state
i am definitely proud to be here in ohio
all right have a good day
we want to thank our heroes of hope
members of the national guard who've
done such a great job with
taking testing to many many communities
around the state we'll close with a
quote from
three-time presidential candidate
unsuccessful
but three-time presidential candidate
william jennings bryan
and i think it's appropriate to and the
challenges that we're facing
uh today destiny is not a matter of
chance
it's a matter of choice it's not a thing
to be waited for
it's a thing to be achieved end of quote
tuesday is election day we will not have
a press conference on
on tuesday a regular scheduled press
conference will be thursday unless there
is some
breaking news and some reason that we
need to have a press conference before
next thursday thank you very much
