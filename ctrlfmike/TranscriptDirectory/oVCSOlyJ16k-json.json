    "ultimately this transfer of power",
    "if you just bear with me for a moment",

    "it's talking about the campaign and",
    "campaign ending",
    "all of this is in and talking about",
    "election day",
    "all of this is invisible for it is the",

    "that as it happens it is a mystery",
    "in which millions of people each fit one",
    "fragment",
    "of a total secret together none of them",
    "knowing the shape of the whole",
    "what results from the fitting together",
    "of these secrets",
    "is of course the most awesome transfer",

    "the power to marshal and mobilize the",

    "as the transfer this power takes place",
    "there's nothing to be seen",

    "waiting",

    "we are announcing today our next round",
    "which opens up today",
    "october 1st hard to believe it's october",
    "1st already",
    "and that will close on october the 30th",
    "anybody who's interested in more",
    "information go to techcred.ohio.gov",
    "to find out how you as an employer can",
    "get funding to upskill your workforce",
    "and how individuals can get these tech",
    "based credentials",
    "now i'm going to turn to",
    "dr abby norris turner from the ohio",
    "state university",
    "as many of you know we worked with the",
    "ohio department of health to perform an",
    "antibody study",
    "our abbey did and her team to learn more",
    "about the rate of the virus spreading",
    "and to create",
    "a benchmark for positive results so we",
    "can know more accurately how",
    "to track the spread in coming months",
    "really we're trying to find out maybe",
    "how many people have had the virus how",
    "many people have the virus",
    "what we can learn for that i",
    "am it's great that dr abby norris turner",
    "is able to join us today to talk dr",
    "turner norris turner is an infectious",
    "disease epidemiologist",
    "she has decades of experience in this",
    "area and has shifted her focus this year",
    "to understanding the epidemiology of",
    "covid19 in our state",
    "she has been a great resource to the",
    "governor and me",
    "and our entire team throughout and i",
    "want to thank",
    "dr norris turner for joining us and and",
    "if you could doctor please let us know",
    "how the study was conducted and what you",
    "found",
    "yes i'm happy to do that um and it's",
    "really a pleasure to be able to be with",
    "you here today",
    "um so i want to start out of course by",
    "also thanking",
    "the colleagues who helped to make this",
    "work happen so",
    "both folks i worked with at ohio state",
    "but also an incredible group",
    "at the ohio department of health also",
    "our partners with",
    "our partnerships with local health",
    "departments and local health districts",
    "who let us work out of their buildings",
    "during 20 hot days in july",
    "and more than 100 study staff members",
    "who helped us",
    "to collect data and supported the teams",
    "in the field with logistics",
    "and other and other tasks and most",
    "importantly the participants so folks",
    "across the state of ohio",
    "who agreed to join this project and help",
    "us answer this question",
    "uh so to jump right into it um the",
    "purpose of this project that we carried",
    "out",
    "was to create or to calculate two",
    "specific",
    "estimates um the first was the estimate",
    "of",
    "active covid19 so how many people have",
    "covered 19 at that moment in time",
    "the second was to estimate the",
    "prevalence of people who had had covet",
    "19",
    "in the past and the way that we did that",
    "was to",
    "select 240 census tracts that are",
    "geographically representative across the",
    "state",
    "and then within those 240 census tracts",
    "we randomly sampled",
    "households um once we had that",
    "that list of households we sent folks",
    "first a postcard",
    "and then a letter which explained what",
    "would happen with the research study and",
    "also gave them instructions for how they",
    "could opt out of participation",
    "if they knew ahead of time they didn't",
    "want to join the study um",
    "from people that we did not hear from",
    "ahead of time we visited them",
    "at their home and we explained the study",
    "in person if someone was home",
    "and if someone was not home we left",
    "information about the study",
    "at the home and asked them to call us in",
    "which case we would",
    "or or text us or email us in which case",
    "we'd come back",
    "for people who are interested in",
    "proceeding we went through the process",
    "of informed consent so they understood",
    "what was involved with the project and",
    "those who consented then went on to give",
    "biological samples which is what we",
    "we then tested to be able to come up",
    "with our estimates of infection",
    "um so a trained nurse from the ohio",
    "department of health",
    "first collected a blood sample which we",
    "tested for antibodies against covin-19",
    "and then a nasopharyngeal swab sample",
    "which is what we tested to look for",
    "active disease",
    "and these results at the end of the",
    "study are combined statistically",
    "so the households going into the census",
    "tract and the census tract",
    "representing the state to come up with",
    "these estimates that would be a",
    "statewide estimate of prevalence",
    "so over these 20 days in july from july",
    "9th to july 28th",
    "727 ohio adults participated",
    "in the research and once the laboratory",
    "assays were done we combined those",
    "findings using",
    "a bayesian statistical approach to",
    "generate these estimates and so",
    "for active disease we found that 0.9",
    "of the sample so that's just under one",
    "percent of the sample",
    "had active covid19 during that time um",
    "and the confidence interval around that",
    "0.9",
    "percent goes from point one percent to",
    "two point zero percent",
    "um and following a similar process",
    "looking at the antibody findings",
    "we found that one point five percent of",
    "people in the study",
    "had evidence of antibodies to cobit",
    "nineteen um and the confidence",
    "interval around that goes from 0.3 to",
    "2.9",
    "and just a note of a sort of reminder to",
    "folks thinking about those antibody",
    "results",
    "we now understand that the assays that",
    "are conventionally used to measure",
    "antibodies to coven 19",
    "they are only provide a look back window",
    "of about three months",
    "so that those antibody numbers don't",
    "tell us who's been infected since the",
    "beginning of the pandemic in ohio",
    "for a study done in july it's really",
    "only a maximum look back to about the",
    "middle of april",
    "we don't have a lot of data to compare",
    "our findings to but what we do have",
    "suggests that what we found is right",
    "along with expectations so",
    "those numbers are similar for example to",
    "what the ohio red cross is reporting",
    "among antibody prevalence for antibody",
    "prevalence among blood donors",
    "and just this week cdc released findings",
    "from a large zero prevalence study that",
    "they're doing",
    "across the whole country including in",
    "ohio and our results are also similar to",
    "what they found",
    "well great um i know that uh",
    "that a lot of people have been you know",
    "awaiting this to find out because",
    "somebody always wants to ask the",
    "question",
    "how many people in ohio have had the",
    "virus",
    "i know that that this study you know",
    "can't definitively",
    "tell us this you know what if you look",
    "out and try to do your best",
    "to extrapolate out how many people can",
    "we estimate in ohio",
    "may have had the virus already or",
    "currently do",
    "yeah such an important question and of",
    "course critical for understanding",
    "kind of what's coming next right we",
    "always want to look back at what's",
    "happened",
    "so far so",
    "one of the important answers to this",
    "question is that these data from this",
    "study can't give us a precise number",
    "what we can say more generally and with",
    "confidence is that the prevalence of",
    "cova 19",
    "among adults in ohio this study only",
    "only tested in adults",
    "but the prevalence in adults in ohio is",
    "relatively low",
    "has remained relatively low the flip",
    "side of that coin of course",
    "is that that means many more people are",
    "still susceptible",
    "to infection so just to convert some of",
    "our prevalence",
    "numbers uh estimates into real numbers",
    "um i told you that 0.9 of the sample",
    "had active disease during during this",
    "period of july",
    "and if you look at the population of",
    "ohio adults that corresponds",
    "to about 80 thousand ohio adults who",
    "would have had cova during these 20 days",
    "in july similarly if you look for that",
    "at that 1.5 percent antibody prevalence",
    "that corresponds to about 133 000 ohio",
    "adults",
    "who had evidence of past infection but",
    "we can't really extend those numbers to",
    "other time periods",
    "because whether people were exposed",
    "depends on the prevalence at other time",
    "periods",
    "in that in and um and basically what was",
    "the circulation",
    "of the virus in their communities at",
    "those other time periods",
    "so it's hard it's hard to take what we",
    "learned from july and make a broader",
    "argument than just that period of time",
    "um again though even in place of exact",
    "estimates what we can say with",
    "confidence",
    "is that some hundreds of thousands of",
    "ohioans have had covid",
    "and millions of ohioans remain",
    "susceptible to covid",
    "so the same public health efforts which",
    "have worked to keep the prevalence of",
    "disease low are still needed to prevent",
    "ongoing and forward transmission",
    "[Applause]",
    "another question i know that i i always",
    "get a lot of people who are curious",
    "because the antibodies",
    "stay in our system somewhere i think i",
    "heard you say maybe you didn't say it in",
    "this",
    "but on another time you know about 50 of",
    "them",
    "fifty percent of the sample keeps",
    "antibodies antibodies for",
    "two months um some of the the other",
    "fifty percent may be for three months",
    "but very few people carry antibodies",
    "beyond three months that are detectable",
    "but that doesn't mean",
    "that they that after three months that",
    "they still don't have some type of",
    "immunity that we would expect so",
    "to give us a a feel for what that means",
    "in terms of antibodies and immunity to",
    "the virus once you've had it",
    "yes i'm happy to tell you what what's",
    "the state of the science",
    "at this moment with immunity um and with",
    "the",
    "huge caution that this like so many",
    "things with covet this is changing all",
    "of the time as we have",
    "new information from around the world",
    "really so",
    "so what you said is is true which is",
    "um most people will no longer have",
    "detectable antibodies",
    "um at least from what is measured in",
    "these conventional assays",
    "for longer than than three months um",
    "and what that means after that three",
    "month period for their immunity",
    "is really still an open question um it",
    "may be that there are other",
    "elements of their immune system that are",
    "still active",
    "but we're not measuring that and so we",
    "don't know if that's providing some kind",
    "of protection",
    "similarly what we tend to do is measure",
    "the level of antibodies in people's",
    "blood",
    "but maybe what we should be measuring",
    "instead is the activity of those",
    "antibodies how good",
    "is that person's antibodies at",
    "neutralizing the virus when exposed for",
    "example and maybe that's more meaningful",
    "for understanding",
    "their immunity so to answer your",
    "specific question",
    "um maybe there's some short-term",
    "protection um",
    "and epidemiologically we we don't see a",
    "lot of reinfection",
    "occurring in that three-month window so",
    "so maybe there's some short-term",
    "um protection against against",
    "re-infection um",
    "we are starting to see re-infections in",
    "the scientific literature now",
    "although they tend to happen a little",
    "bit longer after the initial infection",
    "and what's really unclear right now is",
    "whether those are going to be general",
    "trends",
    "that that the population at large will",
    "be susceptible longer",
    "uh or after some time or whether there's",
    "something special about those people",
    "maybe they they didn't",
    "mount a full immune response at the time",
    "um and so they remained susceptible",
    "so so i guess the conclusion to this is",
    "that covert 19 continues to surprise us",
    "um and so we shouldn't make any",
    "optimistic or pessimistic",
    "uh predictions about short or long-term",
    "immunity to disease",
    "but those surprises keep giving us",
    "opportunities to work with stakeholders",
    "really across the state and around the",
    "world to answer those questions",
    "great well thanks for doing the study",
    "for us and for",
    "joining us today i know that",
    "more information about the study will be",
    "available on our coronavirus website",
    "under the dashboard overview we really",
    "appreciate uh what you did to help us",
    "have a little better perspective on this",
    "um i guess probably one more question",
    "ohio fits in",
    "compared to how and some of the studies",
    "have gone on in the other states are we",
    "pretty comparable uh in the",
    "very local region of the midwest where",
    "we are we are among",
    "the lowest so um i believe west virginia",
    "and at the time that the the study was",
    "done wisconsin were slightly lower than",
    "ohio",
    "um were quite similar to indiana and",
    "um we're lower of course than",
    "pennsylvania and",
    "um you know much lower than than new",
    "york",
    "um so yeah well great we appreciate your",
    "time",
    "thank you very much thank you so much",
    "a couple of uh final issues we like to",
    "highlight",
    "we like to highlight businesses who are",
    "stepping up",
    "to try to help us work through the virus",
    "response and to help the citizens of the",
    "state of ohio",
    "learn to live with a virus in their",
    "lives and get through it",
    "as well as we can today i want to",
    "highlight uh",
    "an announcement that's being made by the",
    "foundation",
    "for appalachian ohio we",
    "governor and i often talk about the need",
    "for internet connectivity",
    "for our students for health care for the",
    "economy",
    "and today the foundations i'm",
    "a child of appalachia fund has partnered",
    "with facebook",
    "and t-mobile to provide hot spots to",
    "libraries",
    "in southeast ohio that will be made",
    "available",
    "to be checked out like other library",
    "resources",
    "facebook is providing these mobile",
    "hotspots at no cost to the libraries",
    "along with six months of unlimited data",
    "usage on the t-mobile network and then",
    "t-mobile",
    "is kicking in an additional six months",
    "so these hot spots will be available",
    "for a full year of unlimited data for",
    "use by",
    "library patrons as well as helping those",
    "hot spots",
    "already in use the foundation for",
    "appalachia ohio",
    "appalachian ohio is one of the many",
    "organizations to help us fill",
    "this important role if you'd like to",
    "find out more about the effort you can",
    "go to",
    "appalachianohio.org",
    "uh this initiative very complementary to",
    "something the governor and i",
    "announced where we put 50 million",
    "dollars of cares act funding",
    "made that available for schools this",
    "will help communities and families as",
    "well",
    "this pilot will be or this",
    "program will be available at a minimum",
    "in athens",
    "harrison highland jackson lawrence meigs",
    "pike minton in vinton counties and",
    "there's an endeavor to get out a total",
    "of 240 hot spots to the libraries",
    "uh in these in these communities to help",
    "extend",
    "uh broadband high-speed internet i",
    "should say high-speed internet service",
    "to the people in these communities so",
    "thanks to",
    "uh the foundation and facebook and",
    "t-mobile for stepping up",
    "to help people in this time of need and",
    "then finally",
    "uh a quick update",
    "last year i went to london",
    "to work with jobs ohio on the london",
    "stock exchange group",
    "moving its america's headquarters to",
    "cleveland due to covid that",
    "has been postponed the physical location",
    "of the headquarters until 2021",
    "but that doesn't mean that the virtual",
    "uh the virtual",
    "efforts are not underway they absolutely",
    "are",
    "and i'm glad to announce today the",
    "financial support thanks to the",
    "financial support",
    "of the greater cleveland partnership",
    "fifth third bank and jobs ohio",
    "that over 10 companies will be",
    "beginning to participate in the elites",
    "international private company",
    "development platform",
    "the cleveland cohort will start on",
    "october the 12th",
    "why is this important because the",
    "companies that participate in this",
    "historically have experienced seven",
    "times the growth created four times more",
    "jobs",
    "than their industry peers we want to",
    "jump start",
    "these activities these businesses in",
    "ohio",
    "to take them from small businesses to",
    "medium businesses medium-sized",
    "businesses maybe someday",
    "even a larger business by helping them",
    "understand how they can grow and connect",
    "to the rest of the world and so",
    "we appreciate that the global elite",
    "program",
    "and and the partnership the cleveland",
    "growth partnership and and fifth third",
    "bank along with jobs ohio",
    "are helping to promote this and get this",
    "started and governor",
    "if just one thing i'd like to say in",
    "support of your earlier comments",
    "uh thank you for what you said about",
    "america",
    "and our democracy and our elections uh",
    "our elections in ohio are tried true",
    "true and tested and i want to remind",
    "folks i had the privilege of serving",
    "ohio as ohio secretary of state for",
    "eight years",
    "and as its chief elections official and",
    "remember elections in ohio are run by",
    "your neighbors",
    "the 88 county boards of elections they",
    "are made up of democrats and republicans",
    "that live in your community",
    "the local polling locations are are",
    "operated",
    "by men and women who are your friends",
    "and neighbors",
    "and if you have concerns if you have",
    "questions about whether the elections",
    "process",
    "is going to run well be part of it you",

    "elections in ohio are the people of ohio",
    "you can be one of them so go to",
    "voteohio.gov",
    "and sign up to be a poll worker because",
    "our election",
    "system in ohio is a great one",
    "because it's run by the people of our",
    "state it's",
    "it's something that you can count on",
    "please participate",
    "as a poll worker it will give you",
    "insights and",
    "probably help you build confidence in",
    "the system we have in our state",
    "governor thank you very much and back to",
    "you lieutenant governor thank you very",
    "much",
    "um we're going to try to get this much",
    "time for questions",
    "today but i do want to go through this",
    "pretty quickly this is thursday so this",
    "is the day we put",
    "new data out so let's go to our daily uh",
    "slide which is up here what you will see",
    "here",
    "you know we were tracking down",
    "and for a while we had an average below",
    "a thousand cases a day uh now we're",
    "above that and as you can see uh for",
    "yesterday the most recent data",
    "it's 1327 cases so",
    "going going starting to go back up it",
    "looks like",
    "in regard to that i'd also mention the",
    "positivity number",
    "uh which we talk a lot about and you'll",
    "see that in a minute and some other",
    "states where",
    "we're advising you to be careful if you",
    "go there our positivity",
    "for the last month or so has been coming",
    "down um",
    "and it got below a little bit below",
    "three percent",
    "three percent in fact i think it was",
    "down at one point to two point six",
    "uh we're now starting to see it go back",
    "up and so we don't know",
    "that's a long-term trend our most recent",
    "day",
    "was four percent uh we're averaging a",
    "little bit over three percent",
    "um so we're watching that we don't know",
    "that's a long-term trend or not we",
    "certainly hope it is not but we're",
    "seeing the cases",
    "go up and we're starting to see the",
    "positivity inch back up",
    "and we hope it's not a long trend um",
    "eric let's look at the",
    "case possiblization and death table",
    "we won't go through this this is posted",
    "you can take a look at it but if you",
    "want to look at your county",
    "what you can do is you can look and see",
    "the number of cases",
    "we have this in september",
    "so as september ends you can look back",
    "and see cases how many cases your county",
    "had new cases your county had",
    "in the month of september how many",
    "people went to the hospital were",
    "hospitalized during that period of time",
    "and then you also see the number of",
    "deaths that are reported",
    "uh during that period of time these are",
    "lagging indicators",
    "um and they they lag behind and as i've",
    "said before the deaths are reported when",
    "we get them",
    "not necessarily when that death death",
    "actually",
    "actually occurred eric let's go to the",
    "travel advisory map",
    "these are the county excuse me these are",
    "the states",
    "we'll see how good everybody's uh map",
    "map judgment is here but these are the",
    "states that",
    "have over 15 percent",
    "seven day moving average",
    "highlight states are ones that are",
    "currently reporting a positivity of 15",
    "percent or more",
    "so again you're traveling to those",
    "states obviously",
    "and coming back be careful if you're",
    "traveling there staying for a while be",
    "careful",
    "uh as well let's look now at our next",
    "slide eric this is",

    "being on the rise and the positivity",
    "coming up but we've got high school",
    "playoffs starting up they just announced",
    "the football",
    "brackets today they're actually being",
    "loaded as we speak",
    "is there any talk of maybe increasing",
    "the amount of",
    "fans that are going to be allowed",
    "especially as we get deeper in the",
    "tournament",
    "and they tend to use bigger stadiums",
    "well our goals scott remain the same and",
    "that is that parents have the",
    "opportunity to go see their kids play",
    "family members so if anything is done",
    "and we're open to to talk",
    "from to the school officials we granted",
    "for example",
    "the local health departments and the",
    "state dozens of variances",
    "uh throughout this year in regard to to",
    "their schools",
    "in order to allow parents to attend and",
    "that's our goal so as we look at",
    "playoffs",
    "that will remain our goal and you know",
    "as we look at you know every sport's",
    "different",
    "cross country is a lot different than",
    "football you know we're open to try to",
    "accommodate so that",
    "the athletes can run",
    "play football whatever this sport is",
    "um and at the same time the parents can",
    "come and see them play their loved ones",
    "can see them play so that will be our",
    "kind of our",
    "our north star as we as we look at that",
    "next question is from john london at",
    "wlwt in cincinnati",
    "hey john governor hamilton county and",
    "clermont county uh",
    "going red and butler county staying red",
    "you know that's a big section of",
    "southwest ohio and i'm wondering what",
    "you envisioned for the early fall now",
    "going into thanksgiving",
    "and what actions you might consider",

    "sports",
    "and daily activity",

    "departments frequently we're talking to",
    "school superintendents i get emails from",
    "different",
    "superintendents um you know",
    "in regard to our schools i think our",
    "schools are doing a very good job",
    "uh they're on this they're doing the",
    "best job that they can",
    "what we're seeing is you know our",
    "concern",
    "was that when we saw outbreak with kids",
    "that that would lead to outbreak with",
    "older",
    "ohioans we are seeing that what we don't",
    "know is if there's a cause and effect",
    "we're seeing",
    "more from older ohioans you know for a",
    "month or so it's been",
    "you know a big percentage is under under",
    "the age of 30.",
    "now we're seeing these numbers go back",
    "up with an older population",
    "and so uh the the simplest thing to do",
    "um is to be able to curtail",
    "uh these events i mean i i",
    "read examples if we could get",
    "80 85 percent of the people in this",
    "state in every county to wear a mask",
    "when they're out in public",
    "and to avoid these big events",
    "we'd have this thing under control i",
    "mean it'd still be here",
    "uh but we would have it under control",
    "and so i know everybody's tired i'm sick",
    "of it",
    "you're sick of it we're all sick of it",
    "uh",
    "but we got to hang in here uh you know i",
    "get the question a lot when mike when's",
    "this over when can i take my mask off",
    "when can i go about life is normal and i",
    "don't have a great answer",
    "but the best answer i can come up with",
    "is when",
    "we can that will happen when we get",
    "hurt immunity and as you heard from the",
    "discussion",
    "uh that john husted had in the study",
    "that he presented today",
    "we're not going to get that without the",
    "vaccine i mean we're not going to work",
    "our way into this for",

    "virus low",
    "keep our foot on us on its neck",
    "and wait and we wait for the vaccine to",
    "hit and when",
    "it gets here and the first people",
    "started",

    "nursing homes and others is going to",
    "talk",
    "start with our first responders and it's",
    "going to take a while to get this out",

    "way out so we've got a significant",
    "segment of the population and i don't",
    "know what that",
    "segment is but significant segment you",
    "know that have that",
    "that immunity if these if this does in",
    "fact work the way we hope it will",

    "again before",
    "tens of millions of people during the",
    "debate he refused to",
    "say that he would abide by the results",
    "of an election in which he's behind in",
    "the polls and",
    "you know i want to be clear about what's",
    "at stake here uh hundreds of",
    "americans have died on hundreds of",
    "battlefields affecting",
    "the principle that an adopted democracy",
    "leaders yield power to the will of the",
    "voters so",
    "respectfully i'd like to ask you again",
    "do you contempt",
    "condemn trump's refusal to say he'll",
    "respect the will of the voters",
    "or i i think i addressed this you know",
    "in my opening statement that",
    "whoever loses",
    "once it's determined that they've lost",
    "they lose and you know we we can go back",
    "in the most",
    "hard-fought campaigns in anyone's memory",
    "and as i said the other day my dog is",
    "jumping up here",
    "um as we said the other day",
    "first election i really remember as is",
    "nixon and kennedy and people won nixon",
    "you know uh won nixon to contest it hey",
    "they stole the election from you in",
    "chicago they did this and that",
    "and you know he said no i'm not going to",
    "do it",
    "i'm not i'm not going to do it",
    "the gore bush nothing could be more",
    "highly contested went all the way the",
    "supreme court went into december",
    "uh but when the when it was finally",
    "clear court of rule that was it",
    "you know losing candidate",
    "vice president gore conceded",
    "so whoever loses will concede",
    "this is what we do as americans so",
    "you know this is what we do and",
    "this is what we expect and that's the",
    "name of the game when you get in the",
    "game you know that you may lose someday",
    "you may lose in presidential election or",
    "u.s senate race or",
    "state legislature and you lose you lose",
    "that's it so look any anything to the",
    "contrary is just not right i mean",
    "no this is what is great about this",
    "country",
    "um we have carried this out as theodore",
    "white the",
    "excerpt i read says you know we've done",
    "longer than anybody else has",
    "and we've done it successfully and we do",
    "it every four years",
    "and i'll tell you we're going to do it",
    "this year",
    "uh jim province from the toledo blade is",
    "back uh jim please ask yourself",
    "hi can you hear me now you're good you",
    "sound good",
    "great um i was just trying to get at the",
    "practical",
    "um aspect of the prevalence study is",
    "there something that we can do",
    "today today that we were not able to",
    "make before we had this information",
    "john can you hear that yeah i i did",
    "you know look we we wanted",
    "we wanted to have information about",
    "active cases and get estimates about how",
    "many people",
    "have potentially had the virus and",
    "um you know when we",
    "had the conversation with the doctor uh",
    "she",
    "she indicated that you know it's hard to",
    "make a hard and firm estimate",
    "i i in looking at the math and having",
    "conversations with people who've looked",
    "at the data",
    "believe that one could conclude that",
    "hundreds of thousands of people have had",
    "the virus that",
    "that you could you look at that",
    "information and",
    "reasonably conclude that five to six",
    "hundred thousand people",
    "maybe have had the virus again not hard",
    "and fast",
    "this this information will be out there",
    "other people will be able to look at it",
    "and come to their own conclusions but i",
    "think the big thing that we know",
    "is that look the goal ultimately is to",
    "get to herd immunity",
    "and that we're going to need a vaccine",
    "to do that if there's one takeaway that",
    "i had from that",
    "information is that we've got a long way",
    "to go",
    "and we've got to get a vaccine and that",
    "the the combination of the two",
    "are the way that we get there and and i",
    "don't know if dr",
    "norris turner is uh on if she could she",
    "wants to offer",
    "any any uh conclusions to that beyond",
    "what i've said um i think maybe we could",
    "have her join",
    "yes i'm still here and i can jump in",
    "quickly",
    "um which is to say that most of the",
    "testing and prevalence information that",
    "we have",
    "in ohio but also across the country",
    "comes from people seeking testing",
    "because they're",
    "unwell or they've had a documented",
    "exposure so",
    "um this was the first study that really",
    "tried to get an estimate much more",
    "broadly",
    "around the number of people who who had",
    "either had infection",
    "in that period in july or or who'd been",
    "exposed without depending on",
    "um their access to testing or their",
    "their desire to be tested um or a",
    "requirement for them to be tested so",
    "when that has been done in other",
    "settings",
    "sometimes what happens is that you learn",
    "that a lot more people had",
    "had infection in the past than had been",
    "reflected",
    "through other data streams um and so",
    "what this study did was to confirm that",
    "in fact the data that we are getting",
    "through other data streams other",
    "surveillance efforts other projects of",
    "the ohio department of health",
    "and others pretty you know do give us a",
    "good sense of how many people have been",
    "have been exposed and how many people",
    "have been sick there wasn't a huge",
    "number of people um and in some other",
    "studies particularly in new york in the",
    "beginning of the epidemic some of the",
    "early cereal prevalence studies",
    "suddenly suggested that lots more people",
    "had been sick than had been",
    "known about and and that's not been the",
    "case in ohio um",
    "there are more cases from our study",
    "there are more cases",
    "in the state than are picked up in",
    "testing that's not a surprise that's a",
    "very standard finding across the country",
    "um but it's not a huge difference it's",
    "not an enormous",
    "disparity and um so we should keep on",
    "doing what we've been doing in terms of",
    "embracing public health",
    "efforts those things are working and the",
    "prevalence is is staying low because of",
    "them",
    "next question is from jim oddy at",
    "w-h-i-o in dayton",
    "governor i have a question going back to",
    "your original uh statement at the very",
    "beginning of all this and that is",
    "uh about the debate the other night i",
    "know you've been part of a lot of",
    "debates",
    "i don't remember you yelling over the",
    "top of your opponent",
    "or them yelling over the top of what",
    "you're trying to say would you support",
    "the commission on presidential debates",
    "going to a mute button that would be",
    "controlled by the moderator so they",
    "could cut somebody off as soon as they",
    "start",
    "violating the rules and trying to shout",
    "down their opponent",
    "well they've already said they're going",
    "to look at this there's certainly been",
    "speculation they might",
    "might do that i think they'll do",
    "whatever they think is necessary to",
    "you know have us focused uh more on more",
    "on substance i don't i wouldn't have any",
    "objection to it i'm not",
    "i'm not a candidate but i wouldn't have",
    "any objection to it",
    "i will say jim as you've watched some of",
    "the debates i've been in and",
    "frankly sometimes you know in in the",
    "battle you get overheated",
    "but um you know that's",
    "that that does in fact happen but um",
    "you know the white house is at stake",
    "the leader of this country will be",
    "selected",
    "it's important that the american people",
    "be able to see",
    "the exchange of ideas",
    "because there are differences",
    "fundamental differences between",
    "uh two these two candidates both both",
    "love america",
    "both love our country but there's",
    "fundamental differences",
    "and i do would hope that the next debate",
    "debates actually as a vp of debate and",
    "then there's",
    "two more presidential i believe um that",
    "they would focus on",
    "on those differences uh i think it's",
    "legitimate for someone to say what",
    "they've done i think it's legitimate",
    "from someone to criticize someone for",
    "what they've done",
    "we're not done i think those are all",
    "things in bounds",
    "so you know this is a",
    "a robust as i described it a moment ago",
    "a robust",
    "discussion debate um hard fought",
    "uh is what the american people expect",
    "but i think they expect it over over the",
    "issues",
    "and be able to sit back and watch this",
    "for",
    "90 minutes or however long it lasts",
    "the the debase of the base of",
    "historically um",
    "you know we went for many many many",
    "years without these formal debates",
    "uh you know but beginning in 1960 we we",
    "had",
    "had one and then i think it picked up",
    "again and i don't know whether it's",
    "68 or 72 but at some point picked up",
    "again then we've now it's a",
    "something we do every every four years",
    "um",
    "so anything that will enhance that",
    "debate",
    "i'm i'm for next question is from andy",
    "chow at ohio public radio and television",
    "hi governor hey andy governor",
    "at the beginning of this you spoke about",
    "denouncing white supremacy the sanctity",
    "of the elections",
    "you just answered marty's question about",
    "you feel pretty confident about a",
    "peaceful transition of power",
    "but how can the citizens of ohio feel",
    "confident about all those things when",
    "president trump",
    "undermines those things and you refuse",
    "to speak out against him when he does",
    "undermine things",
    "like the sanctity of elections like the",
    "peaceful transition of power",
    "like not denouncing white supremacy",
    "you don't speak out against him",
    "i think i've been pretty clear today",
    "um a pretty clear message",
    "what i believe is govern the state of",
    "ohio",
    "this will be a fair election uh",
    "the votes will be counted nobody else",
    "will decide but the voters",
    "however this election comes out as well",
    "as all the other elections",
    "that's who will win any idea that the",
    "legislature will do anything",
    "it's not going to happen we have run",
    "fair elections in ohio for a long long",
    "time there's no reason to think that",
    "this election will not be",
    "a fair one and i think it so it's",
    "important on both sides",
    "um let's not presuppose",
    "we're going to have a problem",
    "when we have both parties who have a",
    "vested interest",
    "in a fair election as john husted",
    "pointed out",
    "what we do in ohio and i suppose they do",
    "in most states is",
    "down to the precinct level we have both",
    "parties involved",
    "it is a system sure there could be a",
    "mistake there can be mistakes",
    "made we don't say it's perfect",
    "but this this elect people should have",
    "confidence in ohio",
    "that that their vote is going to get",
    "counted and they have myriad ways of",
    "voting",
    "um and so we have an obligation to make",
    "sure",
    "that happens we have an obligation to",
    "make sure that",
    "people are right or left who believe in",
    "disturbance",
    "don't believe in the rule of law who",
    "believe that",
    "violence should take over that",
    "that is dealt with and we fully intend",
    "to do that",
    "in the state of ohio um",
    "you know press out conference after",
    "press conference",
    "you know i get asked about different",
    "comments made by the president",
    "somebody else you know i'm not here to",
    "answer every single thing the president",
    "says",
    "i think i've been very clear",
    "throughout my career and throughout",
    "my time as governor what i believe in",
    "and what we will do is not just what i",
    "believe in it's not just what i say is",
    "what we do",
    "and so you know we'll continue to speak",
    "out",
    "against violence we'll continue to speak",
    "out",
    "against you know anything that disrupts",
    "the fairness of an election will",
    "continue to speak out against hatred",
    "and violence that's that's what my",
    "job is my job is not every single day to",
    "critique the president of the united",
    "states",
    "nor to critique joe biden",
    "and you know if there's another",
    "president in there",
    "in january i'll have the same attitude",
    "look i gotta",
    "you know if joe biden is president or",
    "donald trump as president takes the oath",
    "of office",
    "whichever one on january 20th i am not",
    "going to spend my days",
    "you know debating or critiquing what",
    "that president says what i am going to",
    "do is do the best i can for the people",
    "of the state of ohio",
    "and governor and the governor what i'm",
    "saying is as as governor of ohio you're",
    "prepared to stand",
    "against either president trump or joe",
    "biden if they were to do something that",
    "goes against the constitution that's",
    "what you're telling",
    "the people about absolutely well i",
    "thought yeah eddie i thought they",
    "think that was a question absolutely",
    "i think people should know me i think",
    "they should know what you know like",
    "people can disagree about the",
    "what we've done the virus they can",
    "disagree about all kinds of things they",
    "can think my position on this is wrong",
    "my position is that",
    "is wrong but no governor of the state is",
    "going to stand up here",
    "and say that you know or have any",
    "intention i would hope",
    "that we're not going to follow the",
    "constitution the will the people will",
    "prevail in the state of ohio the",
    "electoral votes in ohio will be cast",
    "for whoever gets the most votes in the",
    "state of ohio i will guarantee you that",
    "thank you next question is from max",
    "philby at the columbus dispatch",
    "afternoon governor max um so",
    "experts are warning that child",
    "immunizations are",
    "way way way down this year because of",
    "covet 19",
    "and warning that that could lead to some",
    "outbreaks of measles",
    "and whooping cough and other things so",
    "my question is today",
    "does ohio have the resources to track",
    "and contain",
    "those kinds of outbreaks on top of covet",
    "19.",
    "well i thank you for the question we're",
    "very concerned about this",
    "uh we're very concerned about this there",
    "is this",
    "anti-vaccination movement",
    "that i think is very misguided",
    "we also add on top of that",
    "that people because of the covet",
    "have sometimes been reluctant to go to",
    "their doctors so we are looking at",
    "advertising about this messaging about",
    "this",
    "i will continue to say that you know go",
    "to your doctor",
    "take your kids get their shots",
    "um so this is this is a real issue it's",
    "something we're very concerned about",
    "uh and that we're gonna continue to to",
    "work on",
    "and it's you know it's just it's just",
    "very very",
    "very important the people do that",
    "next question is from jack windsor at",
    "wmfd in mansfield",
    "hey jack hi governor uh this question is",
    "for you and uh",
    "actually first for dr abbey uh and it's",
    "how do you account",
    "for people who were infected well before",
    "july because you mentioned that immunity",
    "can last three months or",
    "easily uh be easily detected during",
    "three months",
    "uh pike county department of health says",
    "they had the virus there in november",
    "2019",
    "a time that would account for close",
    "indoor contact during thanksgiving",
    "christmas",
    "new year's celebrations and we were told",
    "it was more contagious",
    "early on so there are at least three",
    "three-month intervals since that time",
    "period during which",
    "people could have contracted the virus",
    "and the immunity could have gone from",
    "strong prevalence easily detectable uh",
    "like you said to some sort of immunity",
    "that isn't",
    "detectable now so how do you account for",
    "those people who were in fact",
    "infected previously and those topics get",
    "covered in the report and then governor",
    "are you now",
    "saying that we are in for masking",
    "distancing and quarantining for years",
    "no i'll i'll go first um look",
    "i i think the faster vaccine can get out",
    "uh the better it is uh we have one",
    "couple things going for us uh i think",
    "that",
    "the and this is the reason why people",
    "don't want to get it",
    "and should not want to get it and that",
    "is",
    "doctors have already gotten a lot better",
    "keeping people alive",
    "and bring them back to good health that",
    "will only continue",
    "i think we can expect that to continue",
    "the ability to deal with this once you",
    "have covet will get better",
    "every every week uh at the sa at the",
    "same at the same time",
    "um you know the sooner we can get the",
    "vaccines out",
    "and the sooner people take them",
    "you know again been some concern about",
    "whether people will take the vaccines",
    "but the sooner we can get",
    "to that point i don't know what that",
    "point is",
    "but that's what we have to do um and",
    "that's that's what we should do but i",
    "can't put a date on it uh jack there's",
    "no one that i don't think",
    "any any specialist can put a date on",
    "when we will be able to achieve what we",
    "need to be able to achieve",
    "um so i'm going to let the doctor answer",
    "the uh",
    "the other question on on on the study",
    "yes great thank you for the question so",
    "um",
    "what i was saying about that three month",
    "period is",
    "um just something for everyone to keep",
    "in mind if they get",
    "a positive antibody test their screen",
    "for covets for example they",
    "they give blood and the ohio red cross",
    "tells them that their antibody positive",
    "that means that they most likely had",
    "infection sometime in the last",
    "three months it doesn't mean that they",
    "had it exactly three months ago it means",
    "that they had it sometime",
    "in the last three months um and because",
    "those are the same assays that we used",
    "for this",
    "study that was conducted in july it can",
    "only give us",
    "a more confident answer related to the",
    "number of people that were exposed",
    "to coronavirus are not exposed meaning",
    "they they were at risk of disease but",
    "who actually had infection",
    "um in in in the three month period",
    "before that",
    "um how it relates to earlier in the",
    "spring that this",
    "this study i described today doesn't",
    "tell us about those numbers because the",
    "antibody assays",
    "um don't capture infections that",
    "occurred in that time period",
    "and i'll also say um this is just one of",
    "the surprises about cobit 19. so",
    "so folks will know that cover 19 is",
    "caused by sars co v2",
    "and at first we were making a lot of",
    "inferences about things like antibody",
    "levels",
    "from our experience with sars cov1 the",
    "virus that caused",
    "the original sars epidemic and for that",
    "infection",
    "people have antibodies that persist for",
    "many months and even years and so the",
    "assumption was these antibody tests",
    "would give a longer",
    "um picture a longer timeline of how many",
    "people had been infected",
    "and it's only been in the last few",
    "months that there's more data showing",
    "that in fact the",
    "the time span is a bit shorter um to",
    "answer your specific question",
    "about cases uh for example in 2019 i'm",
    "not aware of any plausible data that",
    "shows that there was",
    "circulating virus in ohio um in",
    "in 2019 or or um and and if there were",
    "cases in very early 2020 those",
    "um only were as as folks probably know",
    "only",
    "determined after the fact um because of",
    "course our first documented infections",
    "were",
    "were on march 9th of this year um",
    "thank you next question is from tom",
    "bosco",
    "at wsyx in columbus",
    "hi governor i want to ask you about",
    "something i did a story on last week",
    "when your public advisory map came out",
    "last week delaware county moved",
    "from uh level two to level three and",
    "then this week they're back now",
    "from level three to level two but last",
    "week when they moved to level three the",
    "delaware",
    "general health district came out on",
    "facebook and said hey look it's not that",
    "bad",
    "things are actually improving those",
    "numbers are two weeks old",
    "is what number and this is a question i",
    "know that's been",
    "kind of addressed since march probably",
    "is what",
    "number should people be looking at",
    "to base their their daily act",
    "on state numbers county numbers i i",
    "understand that the map",
    "is like a different set of numbers and",
    "the county's got their daily case",
    "numbers but what and is there a fear",
    "that people will just look at the number",
    "and cherry pick",
    "the number they like when they want to",
    "decide",
    "how they're going to act in their",
    "everyday lives",
    "well excellent question i'm not aware of",
    "what was going on with delaware i'll",
    "find that out",
    "where there was a discrepancy of how we",
    "were looking at things i just don't",
