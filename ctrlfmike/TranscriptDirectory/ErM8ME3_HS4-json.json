    "and around the world",
    "i want to update everyone on today's",
    "data",
    "as you can see our deaths are a very",
    "high",
    "rate and again i would remind everyone",
    "that the deaths that we report",
    "today that came in yesterday",
    "do not reflect the day of the death",
    "necessarily",
    "it's the day that it comes into us",

    "it does not necessarily mean uh that",
    "these were",
    "recent it spreads over a period of of",
    "time",
    "second the case number at",
    "1495 is very very",
    "alarming um that",
    "number now uh is this number of 21 day",
    "average",
    "is now back over over a thousand and so",
    "we do not",
    "like to see that we have seen in in the",
    "last",
    "week our positivity numbers statewide",
    "ticking up as well and the",
    "hospitalization numbers",
    "uh now for the first time in a long time",
    "are really",
    "are starting to go back up uh",
    "eric if you could show the hospital",
    "numbers there",
    "this is let me just go to this first",
    "this is our top 20 counties again",
    "very similar to what we we showed",
    "yesterday",
    "um not a significant uh obviously change",
    "in one day",
    "and these are the top 20.",
    "this is the top 88 and eric let's go to",

    "hospital slide a little explanation on",
    "the hospital slide",
    "this area through here is considered",
    "incomplete so these numbers continue to",
    "fill in",
    "so what is concerning uh is we're",
    "starting we're seeing a",
    "we're seeing a significant increase even",
    "though these are still",
    "filling in so when you see that kind of",
    "uh go up rather dramatically and we know",
    "that that will continue to go up as more",
    "of those numbers fill in",
    "uh for those particular days so we're",
    "concerned concerned about",
    "that um fran and i had a",
    "test about an hour ago an hour and a",
    "half ago",
    "and we do not have the results back yet",
    "happy to take any questions",
    "first question today is from ben",
    "schwartz at wcpo in cincinnati",
    "hey ben hi governor hey ben",
    "do you believe average ohioans will ever",
    "be able to be tested",
    "if they see fit like the president's",

    "in light of this um president trump",
    "testing positive",
    "do you have any plans to test yourself",
    "more frequently for",
    "covet 19 um",
    "i haven't really thought about myself or",
    "fran uh",
    "we felt we should take a test today",
    "um ben i'm not sure i got the entire",
    "part of the first part of the question",
    "but i",
    "think it was about availability of",
    "testing for the average ohioan",
    "uh i think this is going to go up",
    "dramatically i was on the phone",
    "about two hours ago with the head of",
    "abbott labs",
    "they have produced these strips that we",
    "hope to receive in ohio the first batch",
    "of these next week",
    "this is something that the white house",
    "signed a contract",
    "with abbott labs these are quick",
    "tests um they are tests that",
    "are uh basically a strip",
    "so that you know they will be",
    "fairly readily available so",
    "this is going to increase the testing we",
    "think there'll be more of these come on",
    "the market so yes",
    "i think you know we're going to see in",
    "the next few weeks a significant",
    "increase we're still looking exactly how",
    "to deploy",
    "these tests but we want to fill in",
    "whatever gaps we have",
    "left in nursing homes because this is",
    "the most vulnerable",
    "people in ohio we have but also these",
    "could be used to help",
    "kids get back in school quicker that",
    "could be used at the college level",
    "as well and their other uses so we're",
    "looking at an array of uses",
    "for these but this will be the first",
    "tests that are like this that are yes we",
    "said",
    "sort of like pregnancy tests that you",
    "just you can read them quickly they do",
    "not have to go to a lab",
    "and they're relatively cheap uh so when",
    "we start",
    "buying these uh these first tests that",
    "we've",
    "will receive we hope next week are free",
    "to",
    "ohio the federal government has paid for",
    "these the white house has paid for these",
    "once we run through that and that",
    "contract runs out",
    "it's my understanding these are going to",
    "be at the cost",
    "i think of five dollars apiece so those",
    "that will be the cost to",
    "to us in the state so they're going to",
    "be relatively cheap",
    "and they're quick and they're they're",
    "pretty accurate",
    "so we're excited about that",
    "next question is from farnoosh amiri at",
    "the associated press",
    "hi governor thank you for taking the",
    "time today um",

    "approach um",
    "the handling of this deadly virus that",
    "now we've seen impacts everybody even",
    "the president of the united states",
    "well yes even the president of the",
    "united states uh i think this is a",
    "powerful reminder uh to us that we have",
    "to do the basic things",
    "um we have to wear a mask we have to",
    "social distance",
    "we have to be careful we have to avoid",
    "big crowds",
    "i mean it's it's for all of us i mean",

    "you know as careful as fran and i have",
    "been um",
    "you know this was a you know a reminder",
    "to us",
    "as well uh and i think it's just a",
    "reminder to everybody",
    "that this virus um",
    "loves everybody the same as dr atkin",
    "used to say",
    "or hates everybody the same but uh",
    "it does not discriminate and it's gonna",
    "go after anybody",
    "uh and so and it's very just very very",
    "contagious",
    "so uh it it i think is a powerful",
    "reminder and for us to pay attention",
    "the president united states can get this",
    "the first lady can get this",
    "we can get it too and we just got to be",
    "very very careful",

    "participants in the debate",
    "well i know that there were a couple",
    "people there who may not have had",
    "i thought the cleveland clinic did a",
    "really fine job along with case western",
    "at creating an environment that was as",
    "safe as you could make something like",
    "that",
    "there were at least six feet between",
    "chairs",
    "uh the people um were very you know",

    "that",
    "and and so uh um you know that that",
    "would be my",
    "that would be my reaction to that",

    "last week those would still be within",
    "the uh 14 day",
    "time frame and can you tell me i mean",
    "how close were you to the president was",
    "he wearing a mask when you met with him",
    "and were you wearing a mask um",
    "fran and i went on air first one after",
    "it landed",
    "uh we went in in the back walked through",
    "it",
    "went to the president's cabin and a",
    "friend i both had masks on",
    "and the president did not as i recall",
    "and your other question jim had to do",
    "with with the uh",
    "we don't i've not been told",
    "uh that anybody out in the counties",
    "as far as the local health departments",
    "have picked anything up at this point",
    "um if if they do",

    "kind of circling back to the legislature",
    "um they're not required when",
    "they're in the state house to wear masks",

    "yeah i mean i i was at the end of your",
    "question",
    "laura",
    "i i missed the last part i thought i'm",

    "reckless",
    "that they're choosing not to mandate",
    "masks when they're in their chambers",
    "well look it's a separate branch of",
    "government",
    "they make their own decisions but i",
    "think what this reminds us",
    "is that anybody that you come in contact",
    "may have the covet anybody",
    "and that there's no one who is immune",
    "from it",
    "that anybody can have it and because of",
    "the fact",
    "that so many people we know have had it",
    "who didn't have symptoms",
    "or had very light symptoms you have to",
    "literally treat everybody you come in",

    "as if they have it and again if the",
    "president united states can have it",
    "um you know that means anybody can have",
    "it",
    "and so it just it is a reminder to us",
    "and i would urge every one of our",
    "citizens",
    "and i'm watching these numbers as i said",
    "a moment ago and i i",
    "brought these numbers out today because",
    "it was such a huge jump in the number of",
    "cases",
    "close to fifteen hundred cases new cases",
    "uh but frankly i'm worried uh you know",
    "we were doing pretty well um",
    "in on many metrics but i can see this",
    "trend now",
    "setting in and we can stop this trend if",
    "we'll wear a mask",
    "please wear a mask when you're out there",
    "you can stop it",
    "um we control this uh",
    "this is this is not rocket science this",
    "is not difficult",
    "i mean it's it's we know what works",
    "we're a mask work keeping distance",
    "works staying away from large crowds",
    "works not going in even if you're",
    "friends or with family without mask on",
    "and try whatever you're doing",
    "still pretty decent weather outside and",
    "you can you know do it do it outside",
    "i mean these are just basic things that",
    "if we execute on these",
    "eighty percent of us eighty-five percent",
    "of us will wear a mask",
    "all throughout the state of ohio we'll",
    "knock this thing down",
    "and this is just a reminder you know",
    "when",
    "we approach someone or someone is close",
    "to us we have to assume",
    "that they could have the virus",
    "next question is from adrian robbins at",
    "wcmh in columbus",
    "governor thank you for doing this today",

    "to ohio",
    "the trump campaign says they may go",
    "virtual but the vice president will",
    "continue to campaign",
    "especially considering reports of rules",
    "not being followed at cleveland clinic",
    "and the large crowds and few masks we've",
    "seen at other events",
    "look we just ask everyone",
    "be careful",
    "that includes churches that includes if",
    "you're going to a funeral that includes",
    "if you're going to a political rally",
    "wherever you're going to you just have",

    "who are positive and you have to treat",
    "it",
    "like that and if you treat it like that",
    "you're going to be safe and and so um",
    "you know i think that candidates can",
    "have events",
    "with people there but they have to be",
    "very careful about it",
    "and we would just urge the social",
    "distancing while the weather is still",
    "good",
    "campaign throughout october candidates",
    "are used to",
    "doing outside events you know please do",
    "it outside if you can",
    "and you know people should should keep a",
    "distance",
    "when they're there doesn't mean you have",
    "to stop campaigning it doesn't mean you",
    "have to",
    "you know curtail it down to a you know",
    "miniscule number of people",
    "but just following the basic precautions",
    "uh is what we need to do it's what we",
    "all need to do no matter what we're",
    "doing",
    "next question is from max philby at the",
    "columbus dispatch",

    "any contact tracing efforts the white",
    "house might be conducting",
    "given the president's diagnosis and two",
    "following up on adrian's question",
    "given what you said about how it's",
    "impossible to know who has the virus and",
    "we need to just assume",
    "that everyone has it wouldn't it be",
    "safer to just move all campaign events",
    "online for the time being",
    "well look",
    "we're trying to learn to live with this",
    "and i believe we can live with this if",
    "we're cautious",
    "so just as we have said here are the",
    "guidelines",
    "for high school sports",
    "here are the guidelines for this and",
    "that",
    "here are the guidelines for a restaurant",
    "here are the guidelines for a bar",
    "if people will carefully carefully",
    "follow the guidelines we can live with",
    "this virus",
    "and so i would not make an exception for",
    "campaigns and campaign and say campaigns",
    "should just you know be totally virtual",
    "uh we're not saying that about other",
    "things in society",
    "and you know and virtually everything's",

    "some restrictions on on restaurants as",
    "far as",
    "they've got to be six feet apart but",
    "there's no capacity limit",
    "so you know first of all everything's",
    "open uh",
    "and so no i wouldn't say that campaigns",
    "need to completely shut down",
    "i just think they need to be careful",
    "they need to be compliant uh with",
    "with what we request everybody to do and",
    "that is just",

    "there and",
    "and outside of there so we've been",
    "pretty consistent about the value of",
    "this and",
    "we know that that that people don't like",
    "to wear them",
    "it's inconvenient but as i always try to",
    "say that when you when you wear this",

    "well we talked a little bit about",
    "hamilton county i think we've got",
    "something up on",
    "on the web about",

    "a if you look at the map",
    "western ohio is the most prevalent area",
    "literally starting from toledo all the",
    "way down to cincinnati",
    "um it probably is a number of things",
    "uh we're we're starting to see",
    "whereas in the last several months you",
    "know we had a",
    "big number under the age of 30.",
    "we are now seeing those numbers higher",
    "age",
    "what we don't know is whether or not",
    "this is just",
    "young people getting infected and then",
    "turning around and infecting",
    "an older person and that was our fear",
    "but we really don't have the data",
    "yet to tell whether that's really what's",
    "taking place i mean i talked to our data",
    "team yesterday",
    "before the press conference about that",
    "very specific issue they could not tell",
    "me",
    "uh yet and you know",
    "the the tracing that we do um",
    "you know many times particularly when",
    "you have as widespread",
    "community spread as we have today it's",
    "difficult for the tracers and the",
    "counties to come up with one particular",
    "place",
    "that that person got it so",
    "i don't have a great answer i just can",
    "tell you what we're seeing",
    "it's it's going up you know we've seen",
    "this uptick",
    "in the upper midwest um and we",
    "had avoided it uh so far",
    "but uh you know you're seeing you know",
    "an uptick",
    "in indiana and as i said the western",
    "part of the state",
    "is certainly worse than than the eastern",
    "part of ohio",
    "next question is from haley nelson at",
    "wsyx in columbus",
    "thank you for the time we've seen some",
    "leaders in other states in new jersey",
    "for example encourage folks who may have",
    "been at a political",
    "rally to get tested for covet 19 is that",
    "the same advice for folks here in ohio",
    "who were at a rally or",
    "perhaps in the presidential debate for",
    "example should they go out and get",
    "tested yeah",
    "absolutely if you've been a big crowd",
    "you should get tested",
    "i mean we wish you hadn't been a big",
    "crowd but if you were in a big crowd",
    "absolutely i would i would try to get",
    "tested look we put up on our web page",
    "every day",
    "where there's free testing um and",
    "there's also other opportunities to get",
    "testing but just from the national guard",
    "there are opportunities every day",
    "somewhere in ohio may not be",
    "close to you but there's other places to",
    "get get testing",
    "um you know we've got drug stores that",
    "are doing it now so yeah",
    "i would certainly want to get tested if",
    "i'd been in a big crowd",
    "i mean it's just a it's a matter of math",
    "and",
    "it just you know the more people you are",
    "around",
    "and particularly if you're around people",
    "for a longer time so you got two",
    "variables",
    "number of people you're around and then",
    "the length of time you're around those",
    "people",
    "and uh you know so a big crowd big",
    "political rally any kind of big event",
    "uh you've got those things going against",
    "you what you have going for you i guess",
    "is",
    "outside but we know that it while it",
    "doesn't you know",
    "it's better being outside than inside we",
    "also know that it certainly can spread",
    "outside and does spread outside",
    "next question is from tom gallick at",
    "gongworm",
    "hi governor hi tom you yourself earlier",
    "this year had a false positive test and",
    "we don't know but it seems like maybe",
    "some folks might have been",
    "might have tested negative uh before the",
    "debate and actually had uh coven 19.",
    "are you worried that uh some folks",
    "across the state might lose faith in the",
    "efficacy of the testing system",
    "well i don't know what kind of tests",
    "were taken before people went into the",
    "clinic",
    "and um i know the white house did their",
    "own testing",
    "the biden campaign my understanding did",
    "their own testing and then the",
    "clinic was involved in other testing so",
    "you're you're out of my",
    "area there because i don't know what",
    "kind of testing it was but i",
    "did spend some time this morning as i",
    "said uh",
    "you know talking about the new strip",
    "test antigen test",
    "um that's coming to ohio and that we're",
    "going to be deploying",
    "and um i think if you look at the the",
    "antigen test",
    "as a test um",
    "that you you know you would do",
    "potentially much more frequently",
    "that's that that is the idea with these",
    "with these tests it is not the",
    "final diagnostic test but it's pretty",
    "darn accurate",
    "um and so",
    "we will deploy the antigen tests in what",
    "we think is a strategic way to do it",
