    "let's turn now eric to our top",

    "to remind everybody what this represents",
    "this is from the highest to the lowest",
    "just for the past two weeks the number",
    "of cases",
    "and is calibrated per 100 000 population",
    "what we'll continue to see as a movement",
    "towards the rural",
    "counties i think the top uh 14",
    "are all rural counties",
    "top 10 i think is all under 60 000",
    "population so we're seeing a real",
    "movement to our our rural counties",
    "let's go to the slide with the top ones",
    "this week the top county is henry county",
    "followed by mercer county in henry",
    "county they've had",
    "67 cases in the past two weeks which has",
    "elevated",
    "their per capita case count more than",
    "half of those cases are associated with",
    "an outbreak in a long-term care facility",
    "while we know that long-term care",
    "residents are extremely vulnerable",
    "to the virus we also know that the virus",
    "does not stop at the doors of the",
    "facility",
    "as people travel in and out of the",
    "facility the",
    "people who work there they can transmit",
    "the virus",
    "which then translates to community",
    "spread so we can go back and",
    "obviously can go back and forth uh the",
    "best things that we can do to protect",
    "our long-term care facilities",
    "are for everyone to be very very careful",
    "uh in the community stay home when",
    "you're sick",
    "wear your mass social distance as much",
    "as possible regardless of whether you're",
    "visiting",
    "one of these facilities or not these are",

    "our communities",
    "as a whole let's turn to the",
    "color map now eric",
    "and we have some good news and a little",
    "bad news",
    "this week we have six red counties this",
    "is the lowest number of red counties",
    "that we have had",
    "in the alert system since we started",
    "this nine weeks ago",
    "the six counties that are red are mercer",
    "erie preble",
    "lucas montgomery and lorraine",
    "the big story this week is that we have",
    "76 counties at the same level as they",
    "were last",
    "week which is the smallest movement",
    "between levels that we have experienced",
    "so far montgomery county",
    "is the only county to move this week to",
    "red we had four counties drop from red",
    "to orange which is the good news",
    "those counties that dropped from red to",
    "orange are clermont county clark county",
    "franklin county and trumbull county",
    "this is also the smallest number of",
    "ohioans living in red county since the",
    "alert system launched",
    "and this is certainly good news or we're",
    "keeping a very close",
    "eye on all of our counties colleges and",
    "university students are returning",
    "um we're already starting to see some",
    "cases",
    "uh as a result of that uh we're also",
    "seeing of course our k",
    "through 12 that is starting back in so",
    "we're at a",
    "a time where we you know we got to watch",
    "watch what's happening let me go through",
    "and talk about the red counties",
    "briefly mercer county remains read this",
    "week",
    "in the number two slot while the",
    "county's numbers are trending",
    "in the right direction uh it's certainly",
    "too much too soon to let up",
    "even though cases have gone from 298.7",
    "per cap in our alert system two weeks",
    "ago",
    "it is 213 213.7 this week and again",
    "that's that's calibrated per 100",
    "000 population uh and so that remains",
    "uh double over double what uh is",
    "considered a high incidence",
    "of the cases during the past few weeks",
    "the health department has been",
    "collaborating with their local officials",
    "to address the high number of cases in",
    "the county",
    "they've implemented health guidance to",
    "help curb the spread of the virus",
    "let's go to eric county uh erie county a",
    "hundred",
    "they're at a level of 156 cases per",
    "hundred thousand residents",
    "again in the last two weeks uh they've",
    "had 116",
    "cases during the past two weeks which is",
    "a 15",
    "of the total cases since the pandemic",
    "began",
    "they've had a large outbreak in a",
    "long-term care facility",
    "that is now unfortunately spread into",
    "the community",
    "next county is prevalent county it is",
    "red due to a high incidence",
    "numbers uh they're red because they meet",
    "the cdc's threshold for high uh",
    "incidents they added 60 cases during the",
    "past two weeks out of 323 cases since",
    "the beginning of the pandemic",
    "that's about close to 20 percent of",
    "their total number of cases",
    "they have two significant outbreaks and",
    "half of their cases are because of",
    "community spread",
    "so preble county their number is 146",
    "per 100 000. again that's about half",
    "again as much",
    "as the 100 level which is considered",
    "high incidence",
    "let's turn to lucas county they meet",
    "three indicators",
    "they're red because the county meets the",
    "cdc's threshold for high incidents",
    "they are at 110. they added 473 cases",
    "during the past two weeks they went from",
    "an average of 21 outpatient",

    "per day",
    "the virus is spreading between members",
    "of the same household and the county",
    "continues to have",
    "community spread montgomery county",
    "they return unfortunately read this week",
    "they added",
    "538 cases during the past two weeks",
    "which is a which is ten percent of their",
    "total cases",
    "from august sixteenth to august twenty",
    "second",
    "montgomery county's cases increased from",
    "thirty six point nine today to forty",
    "five",
    "uh per day they also saw an increase in",
    "number of outpatient visits an early",
    "indicator from august 5th to august 10th",
    "they increased from an average of 50",
    "cases per day",
    "to 60 new cases per day let's go to",
    "lorraine county",
    "they are at 51 cases per 100 thousand a",
    "lot",
    "lower than many of these other counties",
    "but they do meet four indicators they're",
    "making progress",
    "uh in the right direction which is good",
    "uh their cases per capita numbers have",
    "been decreasing their outpatient visits",
    "also",
    "started to drop again an early indicator",
    "their average outpatient visits dropped",
    "from 26 on august",
    "15th to almost 10 on august 25th",
    "their per capita measure dropped from 80",
    "on august 20th to 51.",
    "as of yesterday",
    "yesterday i was asked about partners in",
    "health two days ago excuse me on tuesday",
    "the ohio department of health's contract",
    "with partners in health",
    "this memorandum of understanding began",
    "on may 18th",
    "and was set to expire last week however",
    "the department of health is in the",
    "process of extending uh",
    "the mou for three more months partners",
    "in health is a non-profit based",
    "in massachusetts they have global",
    "experience",
    "for us they have provided feedback",
    "materials",
    "examples of metrics to measure effective",
    "contact tracing",
    "and they've shared best practices with",
    "us",
    "they have provided these services free",
    "of charge",
    "and our agreement going forward does not",
    "include any",
    "pay either so we thank them for taking",
    "their",
    "expertise and extending it to us and",
    "serving as as advisors and helpers",
    "as we move through this we appreciate",
    "that very much",
    "let's talk for a moment about testing",
    "one of the key components of managing",
    "the virus",
    "and taking care of our citizens is of",
    "course to have testing as",
    "widespread as we can make it",
    "testing allows us to isolate those who",
    "test positive",
    "make sure they have access to health",
    "services and also prevent the spread and",
    "transmission of the virus",
    "since the beginning of the pandemic in",
    "march we've worked hard to increase our",
    "overall",
    "testing capacity which has expanded it",
    "has evolved",
    "over time and we have expanded it but",
    "we're not where we",
    "need to be nor where we certainly where",
    "we want to be",
    "it is a work in progress",
    "the work that's occurred so far includes",
    "the tremendous efforts by the ohio",
    "national guard",
    "in taking testing into our nursing homes",
    "around the state it has also included",
    "free pop-up testing again with the",
    "national guard",
    "going into communities and particularly",
    "underserved communities",
    "throughout ohio and i again would say to",
    "our mayors and our health departments",
    "if you have an area where you need",
    "additional testing where you don't think",
    "there's been enough testing our national",
    "guard can come in and do what we call",
    "the pop-up test where we they just set",
    "up for a day",
    "anybody who wants a test can can get",
    "that get the test",
    "we've also encouraged our retail",
    "partners",
    "uh to offer testing in minute clinics",
    "and grocery stores",
    "just to name a few of the things these",
    "are just some of the things that we have",
    "done",
    "we need to keep pushing for new ways of",
    "testing covet 19",
    "and quite candidly this continues to",
    "evolve and we've seen now the private",
    "sector becoming",
    "as we expected and hoped uh become more",
    "and more",
    "involved and so the testing is evolving",
    "as we move forward i've talked to you",
    "before about our efforts",
    "around pooling we have great hopes for",
    "pooling",
    "and this is something that will expand",
    "our capacity greatly",
    "a couple weeks ago i also announced",
    "ohio's participation and multi-state",
    "effort",
    "to purchase additional antigen tests and",
    "scale our ability to use testing",
    "as a screening tool and again we're",
    "looking at that",
    "uh and and in working uh with our",
    "scientists",
    "to determine exactly how we will deploy",
    "uh",
    "those antigen tests uh no decision on",
    "that has been made yet",
    "uh and last week i announced that the",
    "state is working with assisted living",
    "centers",
    "on a new way of collecting samples using",
    "saliva instead of a nasal swap",
    "i will point out that this testing which",
    "is just",
    "it started is the pcr",
    "testing uh which is the testing that if",
    "you've received a test and allow you",
    "probably",
    "had the pcr uh testing",
    "um we began this testing",
    "process last week and what it does is it",
    "involves",
    "the local home the local residents the",
    "local facility",
    "of assisted living to be involved in",
    "gathering",
    "the sample some of our assisted",
    "facilities uh living facilities noticed",
    "uh what they felt were inconsistent",
    "results",
    "and as a result of that uh we've",
    "determined to start in looking at this",
    "so we pause this method of specimen",
    "collection for the assisted living",
    "facility testing",
    "temporarily in order to do controlled",
    "validation testing to see if the",
    "irregularities can be attributed to the",
    "maybe the test kits maybe the lab",
    "or if it's an issue in the collection",
    "process",
    "so we have some control testing that was",
    "supposed to start today i believe it has",
    "started today will continue tomorrow",
    "and we should have some results by live",
    "late sunday or",
    "monday uh which time we will announce",
    "those results",
    "uh and then make a decision in regard to",
    "where we move from here in regard to the",
    "testing",
    "at our assisted living facilities i want",
    "to thank our partners in the assisted",
    "living community and the local health",
    "departments for working with us",
    "on that",
    "let's talk a little bit about uh schools",
    "uh our",
    "this is our k-12",
    "we know that schools are coming back uh",
    "last week this week we know that they're",
    "working very closely",
    "with their local local health",
    "departments",
    "we want to thank them for the great",
    "preparation that's gone into this",
    "the collaboration between them and the",
    "local health department",
    "we want i want to talk today about an",
    "order that we will be issuing",
    "to make sure that the public is in fact",
    "informed about what is going on with the",
    "students",
    "in the school not by name of course but",
    "for the public to be able to understand",
    "uh if there is in fact",
    "virus uh in in the school or if it's",
    "been associated with",
    "the school uh prop reporting to the",
    "public",
    "to parents uh will help prevent a",
    "potential further spread among students",
    "and staff",
    "and it will also let the public know",
    "what's going on so we'll be issuing an",
    "order that requires schools to establish",
    "a reporting mechanism for parents to",
    "report",
    "cases",
    "we know schools have attendance lines",
    "where you can call and say that your",
    "son or daughter is not going to be there",
    "this is where parents report if their",
    "children are going to be absent for",
    "whatever reason this reporting mechanism",
    "could be that hotline if the schools",
    "want to use that as as the hotline that",
    "will be up to the schools",
    "but parents need to be able to call into",
    "a school",
    "and say that their child has maybe",
    "tested positive or whatever the",
    "situation",
    "is with the child within 48 hours",
    "after learning of a student or staff or",
    "staff member who's tested positive",
    "our schools will have to report that",
    "case to the local health department",
    "now that some cases the local health",
    "department will have already known about",
    "it",
    "uh but this is just to make sure and so",
    "the schools will",
    "as quickly as possible report that",
    "information",
    "within that same time period schools",
    "will make the information about a",
    "positive test",
    "publicly available and they can choose",
    "how to do that they can put a press",
    "release out",
    "or they could post the information on",
    "the school district website",
    "just some way so that the public is",
    "informed",
    "schools will also notify parents or the",
    "guardian of the child in writing",
    "and they can do this by hard copy",
    "or they could they could do it with it",
    "with a text or they could do it with an",
    "email",
    "talk about tell them about this and",
    "include as much information as possible",
    "obviously without disclosing",
    "protected health information",
    "reporting illness to parents and",
    "guardians is nothing new for schools",
    "they do it there's head lice in school",
    "you get you know mrs so-and-so or mr",
    "so-and-so's class as the headlights",
    "you know you get the report so this this",
    "is nothing new and this",
    "will not be unusual the health",
    "department will then notify the how",
    "the local health department will then",
    "notify",
    "the ohio department of health on a",
    "weekly basis",
    "about reported cases so that will go to",
    "the state at least once a week",
    "from the local health department and the",
    "local and our state health department",
    "will then put that information",
    "up we just feel that the more",
    "information that is available out there",
    "the better and let me just maybe state",
    "the obvious",
    "if a community has widespread or has",
    "spread and every community has some",
    "spread",
    "of the covid that will be reflected in",
    "the school",
    "so the fact that a school has",
    "reports that there is covet in the",
    "school or a student or a faculty member",
    "or someone who works there the fact that",
    "that gets reported",
    "should not necessarily cause any great",
    "alarm",
    "again the schools are going to reflect",
    "what is in in the community so this is",
    "just a way of let people know but",
    "uh does not mean at all that the school",
    "has done anything wrong",
    "um you know in the conversations i've",
    "had with superintendents",
    "and all the information i can gather it",
    "looks like to me schools are doing the",
    "best job they can",
    "those schools that are open or that are",
    "on a hybrid",
    "system they're doing the best job that",
    "they can on sanitation",
    "keeping students apart wearing face",
    "masks",
    "and doing all the things that they they",
    "need to do so you can do all those",
    "things",
    "and you can still have covet in the",
    "school and the real key",
    "we've known all along is how we handle",
    "it",
    "uh how the school handles it how the",
    "local health department handles",
    "how the parents handle it so this really",
    "is a team effort it's going to take",
    "everybody involved",
    "and the better information that can come",
    "into that school better information that",
    "can come to that",
    "local health department we're going to",
    "be able to manage this better they're",
    "going to be able to manage that",
    "better and our school has a much better",
    "chance of being able to stay open",
    "so literally this is a team effort it's",
    "going to take everybody in the community",
    "working",
    "and if you don't have a child in school",
    "you can still can contribute and as",
    "we're a mask out in public",
    "and be careful so that we keep the",
    "spread down",
    "as much as we can",
    "well speaking of our schools uh",
    "we're going to go to clark county um i'm",
    "going to go to the superintendent of",
    "tecumseh local schools paula crew",
    "paul thank you very very much for",
    "joining us and uh we",
    "we we appreciate it very much you got",
    "your mask on there i see",
    "uh with the t uh that looks looks good",
    "um you're unique i think in clark county",
    "i think you you told me",
    "um as far as how you are",
    "um going back to school i think you're",
    "are you totally virtual totally remote",
    "at this point or will you be",
    "yes governor we are completely remote at",
    "this point for the first nine weeks of",
    "the school year",
    "and and have you started back in as the",
    "company started back in",
    "yes actually yesterday was our first day",
    "starting back with our students",
    "and how are things going they're going",
    "very well",
    "a large learning curve needless to say",
    "going 100 percent remote",
    "i would say our motto right now is adapt",
    "and adjust",
    "as you come across barriers and find",
    "ways to",
    "you know avoid those barriers or",
    "solutions to those barriers if you will",
    "so one of the things you and i talked uh",
    "a week or so ago",
    "and one of the things i was impressed by",
    "is what you told me",
    "um how you're handling uh your students",
    "who might have some special needs",
    "uh could you kind of share that with",
    "with everybody",
    "absolutely so to come to local schools",
    "we have approximately 660 students",
    "that have an individualized education",
    "program",
    "and most of these students a large",
    "amount of these students",
    "are able to participate in remote",
    "learning",
    "if we have the proper support and",
    "services in place",
    "so for example our intervention",
    "specialist and all of our general",
    "education teachers",
    "are working physically in the school",
    "setting",
    "even though we're involved in remote",
    "learning the first nine weeks",
    "this provides an opportunity for them to",
    "collaborate",
    "in order to meet the specific needs and",
    "provide accommodations and modifications",
    "and governors some of those as i shared",
    "with you include",
    "shortening their assignments",
    "highlighting their texts",
    "providing level reading to meet the",
    "students where they're at",
    "and in addition to that just like if the",
    "students were in the school setting",
    "our intervention specialists have time",
    "built in their school day",
    "to work with small groups of students",
    "identified with special needs",
    "via a google classroom and a google meet",
    "so they're having that same the same",
    "services that they would",
    "if they were again in the school setting",
    "so we are using adaptive technology",
    "for our online learning tools things",
    "such as voice typing",
    "highlighting tools and spell check",
    "and so that's for the the majority",
    "governor of students on an",
    "individualized education program here at",
    "tecumseh local",
    "just like all schools i'm sure in ohio",
    "though that are going remote",
    "we have a group of students with intense",
    "special needs",
    "that really remote learning is is not",
    "very it's just not possible these are",
    "students that may have",
    "hearing disabilities these are students",
    "who may be non-verbal",
    "they may have severe cognitive delays",
    "so our plan we had to think outside of",
    "the box and what are we going to do with",
    "these students",
    "what we've decided is we are literally",
    "one at a time",
    "bringing these students in on a bus",
    "twice a week",
    "to work with their intervention",
    "specialists and",
    "to hopefully the goal is to receive",
    "while they're here",
    "their occupational therapy services",
    "and their speech and language services",
    "and their physical therapy services so",
    "they'll have all of those twice a week",
    "within the school setting now",
    "recognizing that",
    "the ppe is important mr charlie",
    "patterson",
    "and his personnel at the clark county",
    "health department have been wonderful",
    "they've actually fitted",
    "our teachers our special ed teachers who",
    "are going to be working with",
    "our students in the school setting with",
    "an n95 mask",
    "and they've provided additional mass for",
    "us to use throughout the year as well",
    "and so those are some of the efforts",
    "that we're making to again adapt and",
    "adjust",
    "think outside the box to serve our",
    "students with special needs",
    "well that's great because i know that",
    "these are the students you know we worry",
    "a lot about and particularly when",
    "they're not actually in",
    "in class but it sounds like you've come",
    "up with a",
    "good way of making sure that we don't",
    "forget these students and",
    "we're able to you're able to help them",
    "so that's great",
    "let me just ask maybe a final question",
    "and i know you've communicated a lot to",
    "parents but what would you say just in",
    "general to parents how can they help",
    "uh their students go through what is a",
    "uh",
    "you know certainly an unusual situation",
    "uh and you know",
    "the distance learning what what kind of",
    "help you need",
    "um in order to provide just the optimal",
    "learning environment for the students we",
    "recommend",
    "that they have a quiet place in which",
    "they can work within the home",
    "we recommend schedule you know we're",
    "hoping to get back to school second",
    "quarter here it",
    "comes to local schools and in order to",
    "do that successfully students are going",
    "to",
    "need to get up and eat a healthy",
    "breakfast and be on a regular schedule",
    "so i think those are the those are the",
    "things that we would recommend",
    "for our parents to be doing at home in",
    "addition",
    "to i have to stress making sure that the",
    "social and emotional well-being of our",
    "students",
    "of their children are of the highest",
    "priority",
    "in conjunction with their academic",
    "learning so reaching out if they think",
    "their child's acting perhaps a little",
    "different",
    "or showing signs of unusual behavior",
    "that they haven't had",
    "we have an excellent team governor of",
    "educators here of staff members",
    "specifically in this area guidance",
    "counselors mental health therapists",
    "psychologists that are helping to",
    "support",
    "our students with their mental health",
    "needs so",
    "we're also trying to reach out and help",
    "our students",
    "we're doing the whole village approach",
    "if you will our bus drivers our",
    "paraprofessionals our teachers aides",
    "some of our secretaries our school",
    "nurses are taking a group of students",
    "and meeting with them individually we'll",
    "have 10 students assigned to them",
    "and they're going to meet with them",
    "individually via google meet one time a",
    "week",
    "and that's to help make sure that our",
    "students know that they're",
    "connected with still they're part of",
    "tecumseh local that we",
    "love and miss them so i think it's",
    "important for parents",
    "to be aware again of those changes",
    "that they may see in students and that",
    "they can contact the school",
    "immediately if they see those well",
    "that's great",
    "um ms crew we we appreciate uh your",
    "dedication to young people and please",
    "thank",
    "all of your team i know it takes a team",
    "effort",
    "um and so this is very very important",
    "and uh",
    "it's been good hearing how you're how",
    "you're",
    "dealing with something that uh probably",
    "when you uh",
    "you went went through college you",
    "probably didn't think you'd be doing",
    "anything quite like this it's remote",
    "remote learning for nine weeks anyway",
    "but",
    "you're adapting and good luck to you and",
    "everybody to come soon",

    "things",
    "one close uh relationship among the",
    "villagers city",
    "and the university uh so that local",

    "relationship also",
    "that includes the local health",
    "department usually it's the county",
    "county health department or maybe the",
    "city health department",
    "but that that close relationship is very",
    "important as well",
    "and a close tie-in between the campus",
    "police or the campus security",
    "and local law enforcement again they",
    "always need to work closely together but",
    "this is",
    "something that's even more important uh",

    "necessary and of course in late spring",
    "it was necessary",
    "but our oilers start safe and stay safe",
    "plan",

    "community",
    "we've had a camp campus-wide adoption of",
    "physical distancing",

    "and currently there are five individuals",
    "on our campus in isolation",
    "and an additional 10 individuals in",

    "tracing",
    "and all of our positive cases past and",

    "week we have",
    "outfitted our all of our classes with",
    "zoom and monitoring",
    "technology uh first class order and",

    "and then we've set up what we call fam",
    "findlay family small group",
    "opportunities for students to get to",

    "uh it's been a tremendous opportunity i",
    "believe",
    "uh to really uh showcase what we do",
    "and to ensure uh that students continue",
    "steadfastly",
    "we have done essentially all that dr",
    "phil",
    "has mentioned with mandatory health",
    "assessments",
    "in some instances mandatory temperature",
    "taking",
    "every student and every staff member",
    "that comes to the campus now",
    "must wear a mask and i'm proud to say",
    "that throughout the summer and the",
    "beginning of the fall semester which",
    "began this",
    "this monday that no one has contacted",
    "any uh cases of covet um here",
    "at our sites the other thing i will",
    "share with you",
    "is um that we have created a",
    "significant relationship with care",
    "alliance one of our",
    "health care agencies here to ensure that",
    "our students staff and faculty",
    "and individuals in a community benefit",
    "from testing and in fact that's going on",
    "right now",
    "at our metropolitan campus",
    "among the things that i'd like to share",
    "with you",
    "is the importance of community colleges",
    "and and continuing to provide support",
    "for workforce development",
    "so throughout the summer we had",
    "individuals come in",
    "uh that completed part of their programs",
    "remotely",
    "uh come to the campuses and complete",
    "their hands-on",
    "experiences uh the first",
    "instance of that was with our police",
    "academy uh back in early may we had 40",
    "individuals being trained for the",
    "cleveland police department who",
    "completed their",
    "training just about a week or so ago",
    "with no",
    "incidents and we're very very delighted",
    "about that",
    "that gave us an opportunity to outfit",
    "physically to accommodate",
    "other workforce programs and also some",
    "of our",
    "allied health programs most notably a",
    "nursing",
    "the one thing i can say about our",
    "students just as dr phil",
    "are conveyed is that they are truly",
    "truly",
    "resilient and while we have not adopted",
    "a particular model",
    "a term alluding to the crisis that we",
    "find ourselves in",
    "we still are relying on our strategic",
    "focus on",
    "access equity and success and when you",
    "think about success",
    "our students and faculty move quickly to",
    "remote instruction",
    "they did an admirable job in converting",
    "to that",
    "and the outcomes have been tremendous",
    "including increased graduation rates",
    "increase graduation numbers uh you may",
    "ask",
    "this question later on but i'm going to",
    "get out a little bit ahead of you",
    "and say to you that even though we are",
    "our students are really responding to",
    "our efforts we still have",
    "gaps that need to be filled in terms of",
    "uh students returning to the institution",
    "and those students are most notably are",
    "pale",
    "eligible or economically disadvantaged",
    "students",
    "are students of color and in some",
    "instances high school students who have",
    "not quite made up their minds about",
    "where they need to go so uh we need to",
    "continue",
    "uh to provide support to them in the",
    "form",
    "of devices uh broadband",
    "access emergency funding and the kinds",
    "of things that would round out",
    "their educational experiences",
    "doctor thank you very much you told me i",
    "think uh if i remember correctly when we",
    "talked before",
    "you deal with 50 000 people in a year's",
    "time",
    "yes who are getting something from from",
    "the college",
    "getting a degree or uh getting",
    "additional training",
    "um you and i talked to about the the",
    "difficulty when if you do remote",
    "uh for welding something like welding or",
    "nursing and can you just",
    "briefly uh tell me how how you deal with",
    "that",
    "and you said you brought some you",
    "brought people back during the summer",
    "yes so we now go into the fall you're",
    "still going to be able to bring some",
    "people in",
    "yes yes and in fact the idea quite",
    "honestly right now",
    "uh mr governor we're at about um",
    "80 percent remote and 20 on ground",
    "that 20 percent as i indicated to you",
    "earlier",
    "is in our workforce area so welding for",
    "example",
    "um manufacturing including mechatronics",
    "uh",
    "you know which is a combination of",
    "different uh certificate okay you're",
    "laughing because i didn't know what that",
    "was i know and",
    "and that's okay that's why dr johnson's",
    "laughing so that's okay that's okay",
    "and so uh we we're doing all of that",
    "uh but we also can do i think a really",
    "better job",
    "in two ways number one if we can figure",
    "out",
    "ways that individuals can develop these",
    "skills remotely and this morning",
    "i had a great conversation with our",
    "mayor frank jackson and he's talking",
    "about",
    "the concepts uh of of um",
    "what artificial what not artificial",
    "reality ar",
    "uh in order to impart training and we're",
    "looking into that as well",
    "and the other thing is having training",
    "locations within the communities called",
    "access centers and as i indicated to you",
    "on the phone we have",
    "established one already on the eastern",
    "side of cleveland",
    "on the west side at esperanza close to",
    "metro health",
    "we're looking to establish one in the",
    "slavic village",
    "area which is a an important community",
    "and we're also looking to expand on what",
    "we do",
    "in the eastern portion of the county up",
    "in euclid so i think",
    "more remote instruction and hands-on and",
    "more",
    "community located",
    "centers like job hubs and access centers",
    "would be i think a great a great answer",
    "that's great doctor thank you very very",
    "much good",
    "good luck this year with and good luck",
    "to all your team we thank them for the",
    "good work they do thank you very much",

    "so any last last thoughts for us",
    "we appreciate it i would say this mr",

    "all of us",
    "of the federal government and the state",
    "government with the cares act funding",
    "that you've been able to help us with",
    "because",
    "it's it's expensive putting all these",
    "protocols in place",
    "uh the first cares act where we had a",
    "chance to really help our students",
    "directly especially our pell grant",
    "students",
    "so you know that that has not gone gone",
    "unnoticed and",
    "and we appreciate it so much and and uh",

    "our universities ohio is just blessed",
    "with so many absolutely wonderful",
    "universities both public and in private",
    "and we're proud of",
    "proud of all of them let me go now to",
    "the lieutenant governor",
    "thank you governor it's great to hear",
    "from all those educators",
    "the educators around the state who are",
    "just doing a fantastic job of",
    "helping students get back in",
    "into making academic progress i wanted",
    "to start on sports today",
    "little review on the sports order uh as",
    "you know",
    "uh governor we always try to pride",
    "ourselves on listening uh when people",
    "ask",
    "questions or they they want",
    "clarifications we always",
    "we always try to to respond and",
    "that's what we're doing here today with",
    "the department of health",
    "making a small change to the what's",
    "known as the 24-hour rule",
    "and you know the 24-hour rule was there",
    "so that",
    "we we limited exposure of teams that",
    "they weren't playing",
    "multiple teams in the in the same day",
    "and how it will read is it says",
    "basically to limit exposure of players",
    "sports participants shall not compete in",
    "more than one contest or game",
    "in a calendar day we're changing 24",
    "hours to a calendar day",
    "no sponsor owner manager or sports meet",
    "event tournament or competition shall",
    "offer sports participants the",
    "opportunity to compete in more than one",
    "contest or game in any calendar",
    "day why well it's just a logistics issue",
    "that some schools were bumping up",
    "against they might have played a",
    "a baseball game on a friday night and",
    "wanted to play one on saturday morning",
    "that's obviously not 24 hours but we",
    "didn't intend to prohibit",
    "this by a couple of hours and so that's",
    "a way to manage it to limit exposure and",
    "allow them to",
    "logistically make these things work",
    "additionally when we say one contest",
    "what that clarifies as well is you may",
    "have a golf team that will play a",
    "a tri-meter a cross-country team that",
    "will do a tri-meet",
    "that we used to say one team we're",
    "talking about one contest we want to",
    "allow",
    "those kinds of things to happen uh",
    "because we know that that",
    "that that they it just presents a",
    "uh some complication in scheduling and",
    "things like that and",
    "and however i want to do want to add one",
    "thing here",
    "is that it does not permit multiple",
    "contests in a single calendar day",
    "you can't play multiple basketball games",
    "or volleyball matches or",
    "or soccer matches in the same day so",
    "it's focused on",
    "just the kind of sports like golf and",
    "cross country where you may have",
    "a couple of teams participating and be",
    "able to do it safely",
    "and i say this because you know we got a",
    "lot of things going on at once right now",
    "as you've noted on multiple occasions",
    "governor",
    "we've got schools starting up we're",
    "trying to to get sports going we want to",
    "we want to we're going to use this as a",
    "testing ground we're trying to learn",
    "if we can get this right and and see",
    "how this is transpiring over the",
    "course the next couple weeks and we",
    "listen and we'll try to adjust",
    "if uh if things go well uh but just",
    "understand that we're trying to go a",
    "little slowly here",
    "to make sure that this works because",
    "ultimately this is about giving kids",
    "the chance to participate uh and when",
    "they participate",
    "in their transition to another thing i",
    "know you and i have had some questions",
    "on is with spectators",
    "um parents a lot of questions athletic",
    "directors schools",
    "a lot of questions and i want to just",
    "read directly from the health order",
    "remind folks",
    "about what the spectator provision is",
    "about it's the primary purpose of",
    "of permitting sports spectators is to",
    "allow and encourage the",
    "family and the household members and",
    "loved ones of players coaches team",
    "members",
    "staff members officials and other event",
    "participants like the banner honor guard",
    "to share",
    "in that experience for those student",
    "athletes and student participants and",
    "and that's what we're trying to do here",
    "because we've heard the questions well",
    "hey the way the rules are written",
    "my family can't come see me",
    "there are many ways which we can",
    "accommodate that and i want to emphasize",
    "this once again",
    "this is at the top of this section on",
    "sports venues and spectators",
    "we want the families to be there uh",
    "there are ways that you can do this by",
    "using",
    "uh lawns and standing room only in field",
    "areas",
    "uh allowable uh to the extent that",
    "they're six feet in distance",
    "in between six feet of distance between",
    "the groups and the patrons",
    "and that's clearly marked and remember",
    "every",
    "school has to develop a plan and",
    "present it to their local health",
    "department and so if",
    "you cannot accommodate the families",
    "under these rules as you see them",
    "written or if you have questions",
    "remember",
    "your local health department is there to",
    "help you do that",
    "you can get a variance to make sure you",
    "can accommodate those family members",
    "we want the families to be there so they",
    "can see their student athletes and",
    "and this order is written to accommodate",
    "that and i",
    "and i know that we've had people ask",
    "about cross-country meets and football",
    "games and things like that",
    "it's designed so that the families can",
    "be there there's a way to do that",
    "work with your local health department",
    "if you have any questions",
    "additionally talk a little bit about",
    "unemployment compensation and the lost",
    "wages",
    "provisions that we've been working on we",
    "received word",
    "from fema that ohio's application was",
    "approved",
    "for federal lost wages supplemental",
    "payment assistance",
    "and we will receive a grant for seven",
    "717 million dollars",
    "to provide additional assistance for",
    "eligible individuals this is",
    "what the the president allowed in his",

    "to provide an additional three hundred",
    "dollars per week",

    "that innovate ohio platform that we",
    "talked about and how we're going to",
    "improve",
    "services to our customers and continues",
    "to",
    "uh evolve and grow governor and and",
    "we're seeing some results so",
    "um and by the way i saw i saw dolly",
    "sneak into the",
    "to the to the set there just a little",
    "while ago i could see her tail so she",
    "was",
    "you took it right in stride i i put her",
    "she she is sleeping uh she's sleeping",
    "between the two flags right now",
    "so yesterday was dog day so we forgot to",
    "say anything about",
    "dogs and everybody's got got dogs let's",
    "go to questions",
    "first question today governor is from",
    "jackie borchardt at the cincinnati",
    "enquirer",
    "hi governor um new cdc guidance released",
    "this week",
    "said that close contacts of people with",
    "covid19 do not necessarily need a test",
    "if they do not have symptoms",
    "should ohioans without symptoms be",
    "tested and also what caused the big jump",
    "in the number of tests today",
    "uh i can't tell you about the the number",
    "of tests today",
    "you talk about the number of cases no",
    "the number of tests reported was",
    "uh more than 68 000 more than yesterday",
    "that's like three times",
    "yeah yeah i don't i don't know uh we",
    "will check on that and see if we can",
    "find an answer uh to that as far as the",
    "cdc",
    "my understanding is they're continuing",
    "to clarify that today",
    "an hour or so ago there's some",
    "clarification",
    "but we see no reason to stop",
    "basically our protocol and our policy",
    "you know there certainly are instances",
    "where you want to be able to test people",
    "who do not have symptoms",
    "i mean one of the things that we know",
    "particularly let's take",
    "going back to college we",
    "know that among young people say 15 to",
    "30",
    "symptoms many times don't show up but",
    "they they can be",
    "they can be carriers they can have that",
    "so we think the protocol that we have",
    "today is correct",
    "we do not want to give up the ability or",
    "we should not give up the ability",
    "nor do we want to to go into an",
    "underserved community",
    "and just not require the symptoms not",
    "require people to prove that they've got",
    "symptoms or if they've got doctor's",
    "order",
    "i mean opening this up i think has been",
    "very",
    "very very helpful and you're going to",
    "continue to see",
    "as i talked about earlier the ability to",
    "expand testing",
    "testing is going to get cheaper it's",
    "going to get quicker",
    "and we need to use every single tool",
    "that we can",
    "to do the testing and then to do the",
    "tracing uh we got to run this",
    "disease down we got to cut it off",
    "and we got to do what we have to do so",
    "we we do not intend to change what what",
    "we're doing",
    "next question is from jeff reddick at",
    "wsyx",
    "in columbus hi governor two things",
    "quickly i wonder if you would uh comment",
    "first on franklin county coming down out",
    "of the red which is quite a success",
    "for franklin county uh secondly the rnc",
    "is going on this week you're probably",
    "the most visible republican governor in",
    "the nation as far as coronavirus",
    "and we haven't seen you have a large",
    "role in that convention i wonder why not",
    "uh well i can't tell you i certainly",
    "support the president",
    "um john and i are part of the co-chair",
    "team",
    "for the president uh here here in ohio",
    "and you know so that's uh you know very",
    "very much uh",
    "behind the president but uh you know",
    "we're focused on what we have to do here",
    "uh to get this economy moving we've got",
    "to keep the virus down we're gonna",
    "you know every single day focus uh focus",
    "on that",
    "uh we celebrate franklin county uh i",
    "know mayor ginther and",
    "council and and and the county",
    "commissioners and everyone is very very",
    "happy today",
    "but look it's a long struggle it's a",
    "long long struggle",
    "franklin county has been read since the",
    "beginning since we started",
    "doing this we really started seeing a",
    "change",
    "when franklin county put on excuse me",
    "when the city",
    "of columbus put on a math score then we",
    "put on a math score that covered the",
    "whole county and other red counties",
    "that was really the break point where we",
    "started to see the use of mass go up",
    "dramatically",
    "and when that use of mass went up",
    "dramatically where you're getting",
    "90 or so we started seeing a slow down",
    "and then starting to come down in the",
    "number of cases so",
    "still a lot of cases it's a big county",
    "but we're moving moving in the right",
    "direction very very happy",
    "about that the battle is still going on",
    "here you can't say it's over with",
    "but we're very happy with what we saw",
    "and we should celebrate this and the",
    "people",
    "of franklin county should celebrate look",
    "this is not something that the mayor did",
    "or",
    "or that the governor did this is",
    "something the people of franklin county",
    "did and they did it",
    "uh by focusing on keeping distance",
    "and wearing masks and doing what had to",
    "be done",
    "next question is from jake zuckerman at",
    "the ohio capitol journal",
    "governor uh this question hasn't been",
    "updated with today's numbers",
    "but where things were yesterday ohio was",
    "set to fall",
    "short of testing estimates that it sent",
    "into the federal government and you",
    "describe",
    "those estimates too low for this month",
    "so how will ohio get its testing numbers",
    "up and why has that not",
    "happened yet there's still a choke point",
    "that's holding things up",
    "yeah and this is not the entire reason",
    "uh but",
    "as you know ohio has never been red-hot",
    "uh at no point during this have have we",
    "been",
    "on on fire we've been where we were",
    "concerned",
    "uh but ohioans stepped up did what they",
    "had to do",
    "the downside of that is that when",
    "decisions are made for example on",
    "reagent",
    "does it go to ohio or does it go to",
    "another state that's a lot",
    "has a lot more cases it goes to the",
    "other",
    "so it's not the entire reason but if you",
    "can talk you talk to the hospitals",
    "you talk to some of the people who rely",
    "on reagents and other things what they",
    "will tell you is",
    "it gets rationed uh and so that has been",
    "one of the",
    "challenges uh we're going to break out",
    "of this um",
    "you know we're not where we want to be",
    "i've been very clear with that",
    "uh but we are going to break out of this",
    "what's the pooling",
    "process that's starting to occur at ohio",
    "state we hope to take that",
    "throughout the state to a number of",
    "number of different labs",
    "we have other contacts with other",
    "companies",
    "to do additional testing in ohio but but",
    "let's be honest",
    "when you start new testing sometimes",
    "there's a glitch like we",
    "we talked about today and uh we are not",
    "going to",
    "wait until every um",
    "you know until it's 100 we know it's",
    "going to be perfect",
    "we're going to take some chances they're",
    "going to be calculated chances",
    "thoughtful chances but when you move to",
    "new testing protocols",
    "sometimes you run into a situation like",
    "we've run into",
    "in regard to our assisted living once",
    "that",
    "is uh is ironed out and figured out you",
    "know that's going to increase",
    "test it rather dramatically",
    "you know we want to take testing in our",
    "nursing homes that now",
    "is at two weeks every two weeks we're",
    "gonna take it down to one",
    "uh and if we have the ability we're",
    "gonna take it down even even lower",
    "lower than that uh so that's where we're",
    "going",
    "uh we're not happy where we are and uh",
    "we're not satisfied",
    "and we'll keep fighting",
    "next question is from ben schwartz at",
    "wcpo in cincinnati",
    "hey ben there um i'd like to ask if you",
    "have a comment",
    "on lebanon schools as they've recently",
    "had to quarantine a number of students",
    "along with hiring their own contact",
    "tracer for the district",
    "i'm wondering if you have a comment on",
    "this idea of hiring a contact tracer and",
    "if you'd recommend that to other schools",
    "to see them do the same",
    "well i don't know all the facts about",
    "you know i've",
    "read about lebanon uh and challenges",
    "they've had but as far as",
    "contact tracing i don't know uh",
    "ideally i mean what we're seeing is our",
    "universities",
    "at that level uh we're seeing",
    "universities becoming very involved in",
    "contact tracing now that's usually under",
    "the umbrella of the local health",
    "department but sometimes they will get",
    "students who get trained and then they",
    "become part of",
    "the contact tracing uh system uh",
    "so at the at the college level uh we",
    "certainly have",
    "have seen that i'm not aware of anybody",
    "else doing it at the",
    "at the k-12 level it could work",
    "and if if it works for them that's",
    "that's great",
    "we made it very clear to every health",
    "department in the state that we have",
    "tracers that are there to",
    "work with the local health department uh",
    "and",
    "fill in the gaps when the local health",
    "departments have got a surge and they",
    "can't keep up with the surge",
    "so i'll check into that what's going on",
    "with",
    "with the school and see what we can",
    "learn",
    "next question is from max philby at the",
    "columbus dispatch",
    "hi governor um with the data",
    "that that the state will be reporting on",
    "its coronavirus.ohio.gov website how",
    "granular will that data",
    "be in terms of school and district and",
    "secondly why give 48 hours to report",
    "that data when the virus could",
    "still be spreading in that time period",
    "well it needs to be reported immediately",
    "um",
    "it needs to look i mean you know if the",
    "parent has the information we want the",
    "parent to",
    "you know get that information in look if",
    "there's a test it's going to get",
    "reported immediately",
    "if there's not a test the child has been",
    "quarantined for other reasons that",
    "information needs to go into that",
    "into that school and we're asking the",
    "schools to make that",
    "information public and to put it on on",
    "their web page",
    "or to send out letters you know if",
    "there's an outbreak in a third grade",
    "class or let's say it's an outbreak in a",
    "high school",
    "you know the school needs to get that",
    "information out to the parents",
    "uh certainly all the parents of children",
    "who are in that building",
    "so it's it's building by building uh but",
    "the big data",
    "needs to then of course obviously goes",
    "to the local health department then the",
    "local health department it goes to",
    "to the state but the whole idea is to be",
    "transparent",
    "about how we're doing this",
    "next question is from spencer hickey at",
    "hannah newman",
    "thank you governor the ohio chamber",
    "released a business survey today that",
    "found economic conditions have",
    "improved since the first quarter but",
    "remained",
    "below average if you and the lieutenant",
    "governor could discuss that",
    "well sure you know again the most",
    "important thing we can do is",
    "try to give people confidence um and the",
    "way",
    "we give people confidence uh in what's",
    "going on in ohio",
    "is to keep the virus down uh i'm",
    "optimistic about our future we're seeing",
    "our unemployment numbers down",
    "but obviously we're not we're not where",
    "we want to be",
    "uh and we're going to continue to you",
    "know keep the virus down and let our",
    "businesses continue",
    "uh continue to grow john or anything",
    "yeah sure sure governor uh look i i",
    "this is going to be a battle for a while",
    "uh it's going to take",
    "time for the economy to recover when you",
    "come through a pandemic",
    "the virus isn't going away anytime soon",
    "the question is",
    "how can we manage it in our lives we've",
    "we've found a pretty good balance with",
    "it uh there are restrictions",
    "but mostly everything's opened up uh",
    "we're",
    "we our employers are doing a great job",
    "of keeping the virus down in the",
    "workplace",
    "our unemployment rate is below the",
    "national average",
    "we're planning every day on what we're",
    "going to do",
    "once life gets more back to normal we're",
    "pushing forward with broadband we're",
    "pushing forward with job training",
    "particularly with tech skills",
    "uh all of those kinds of things will",
    "hopefully position ohio well",
    "as we come out of this but it's this is",
    "look this is",
    "this is going to be a battle for a while",
    "um and",
    "i think that that ohio is well",
    "positioned as governor alluded to",
    "earlier in the day",
    "we got out in front of it earlier in the",
    "news conference we got out in front of",
    "it early",
    "we didn't have a second huge spike like",
    "they had in some of the southern states",
    "we didn't have huge",
    "problems at the beginning like they did",
    "in some of the eastern states we've",
    "we've",
    "kept it under control the job is to",
    "manage through that",

    "one of the reasons i want dr johnson on",
    "from tri-c",
    "uh you know large number of young people",
    "and not so young people",

    "have presented very good plans",
    "um plans that we think make make a lot",

    "we're opening up schools",
    "still that's going on our colleges are",
    "opening up",
    "uh we've got to take a deep breath we've",

    "the bengals have a good plan the browns",
    "have a good",
    "plan um you know one of the things that",
    "they",
    "are looking at doing would be to",
    "have four different groups so you would",
    "enter an exit in that one area",
    "but if you're another group group let's",

    "ever with group two",
    "and three and four um and so you know",
    "they hold what sixty thousand or so uh",
    "fans",
    "so there certainly is possibilities as",
    "we look at the season",
    "to do something it would certainly be at",
    "a much reduced",
    "number of fans but look they've both",
    "been",
    "patient and more importantly",
    "they've come up with plans that are",

    "and make decisions based",
    "based upon that thank you next question",
    "is from kevin landers at wbns in",
    "columbus",
    "afghan governor hey kevin",
    "hi governor franklin county has seen",
    "four weeks of declining numbers and",
    "is it time that city and county health",
    "districts and school districts begin",
    "shifting strategies",
    "perhaps away from masks when they go",
    "from red to orange to yellow",
    "and if counties go from red to orange to",
    "yellow parents are going to want to get",
    "their kids back into the classrooms",
    "what's your take on this what is the",
    "barometer by which",
    "you believe it's safe for kids to go",
    "back in the classroom how many weeks",
    "of downward numbers does it take for",
    "that to trigger",
    "thank you i don't think there's any",
    "magic kevin i don't think there's a",
    "magical answer",
    "um you know to take your first question",
    "if unless i misunderstood it um in",
    "regard to mass",
    "social distancing the current strategy",
    "is working uh",
    "there would be no reason to stop that",
    "strategy in fact we need to double down",
    "the strategy we are still i've talked",
    "with the mayor this morning",
    "uh mayor ginther we're still seeing uh",
    "examples of of people",
    "you know unfortunately who are not",
    "social distancing who are very close",
    "together",
    "and that's worries the mayor worries me",
    "but overall franklin county has done",
    "well and and so the strategy that",
    "franklin county has you've got a good",
    "health department county health",
    "department you got a good city health",
    "department",
    "and they've got a mayor who's very very",
    "focused on this",
    "and the other mayors so look i think",
    "that we're moving forward in franklin",
    "county and we should just continue to do",
    "what we're doing",
    "and continue to try to get people to not",
    "congregate",
    "together we're in franklin county just",
    "as in other counties we're seeing an",
    "uptick",
    "significant uptick among those 18 to 30",
    "18 to 35 we're seeing certainly seeing",
    "those numbers go up as a percentage so",
    "that's that's",
    "remains uh worrisome as far as",
    "when schools should return uh that's up",
    "to the schools",
    "uh that's up to the schools and what",
    "i've you know we have not uh told",
    "schools what to do look we have some",
    "schools",
    "uh in in some of the parts of the state",
    "they're in red counties and they've",
    "opened",
    "uh you know i've cautioned them about it",
    "i've said look you're going to be very",
    "very careful you've got to watch it",
    "uh but we've not stopped them from doing",
    "that",
    "what i've tried to do is to give them",
    "the best evidence and best information",
    "uh that they can get so if you live in",
    "franklin county and you see it is",
    "dropped",
    "uh out of the red that's that's a good",
    "thing",
    "uh i think the schools themselves and",
    "the parents",
    "the families should make the decisions",
    "about does that mean we",
    "you know switch over or not um",
    "i think again you want to see a",
    "sustained trend",
    "uh but ultimately that that decision is",
    "up to the local",
    "that that local community",
    "next question is from adrian robbins at",
    "wcmh in columbus",
    "hi governor i also have a school related",
    "question when it comes to this new alert",
    "system",
    "i understand the importance of being",
    "transparent and alerting parents of a",
    "positive case",
    "but at that point what is your advice to",
    "parents and for teachers",
    "it seems unrealistic that they could",
    "quarantine an entire class or",
    "for a teacher to quarantine every time",
    "they have a positive student so",
    "other than worry what can they really do",
    "with this information",
    "well i'm not suggesting they do this but",
    "one of the things in most schools they",
    "have the option of going remote",
    "if they want to do it now some schools",
    "have said no you can't do that in the",
    "middle of the term but",
    "um again i i think",
    "information in the hands of parents is",
    "always good",
    "parents are the the first teachers the",
    "best teachers",
    "it's their children they they they",
    "are the ones that should you know know",
    "everything",
    "and you just don't want a situation",
    "where parents",
    "don't know anything and schools i think",
    "generally do a very good job",
    "if there's a problem in a certain class",
    "no comes home",
    "and there's a medical problem here and",
    "you know check you",
    "check your daughter's uh your son's hair",
    "or for life i mean whatever it is i mean",
    "anything can happen doesn't mean this",
    "school's doing anything wrong stuff just",
    "happens",
    "um so you know i that's",
    "just bet more information uh is i think",
    "the most important",
    "important thing for parents as far as",
    "quarantining a whole class",
    "look this is a these are clinical health",
    "decisions that have to be made in",
    "conjunction with that local",
    "health department uh and generally",
    "generally my understanding is that the",
    "more",
    "information that's there the more people",
    "are forthcoming the more people",
    "who you know who come forward with",
    "information",
    "the better able the health department is",
    "is to determine a smaller number of",
    "people who need to be quarantined",
    "so it's when they don't have the",
    "information",
    "and people aren't cooperating that many",
    "times you'll see a whole block of people",
    "that",
    "are quarantined that's not what we want",
    "we want to be surgical we want to be",
    "you know based upon the best the best",
    "the best science",
    "governor next question is the last",
    "question today and it belongs to andy",
    "chow of ohio public radio and television",
    "andy hi governor uh also a question",
    "regarding the school notification system",
    "when you do put out the health order are",

    "schools to make sure",
    "that they do not report in order to",
    "protect a",
    "child's privacy yeah andy i mean we",
    "wanted",
    "we wanted to put this out today even",
    "though the order has not been written",
    "because",
    "i want to give schools notice parents",
    "notice we want to give them",
    "you know early information so that will",
    "that will certainly be in the order",
    "we will comply and we'll spell out what",
    "federal law is we'll spell out what",
    "state law is",
    "and certainly you know we do not want to",
    "infringe on people's right",
    "privacy on the other hand we want to",
