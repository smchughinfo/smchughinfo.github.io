    "line and 20 to 29.",
    "so if you look at in september now we're",
    "only we're in a partial month we don't",
    "obviously have the full data for",
    "september we're a long way from that if",
    "you just look at the days so far",
    "in in september uh you know",
    "significant number of cases uh 56 or so",
    "cases that are between the age of zero",
    "and 29",
    "as a percentage so um",
    "again these numbers if you look at",
    "august which is a complete month",
    "which is probably a better month to look",
    "at um",
    "0 to 19 it's 16",
    "the cases made up of that group of",
    "people",
    "uh 22 at the age of 20 to 29.",
    "so again these have been these are going",
    "up they've kind of stabilized now",
    "but again it's just it's just",
    "interesting to see where these cases",
    "uh are eric you want to pull the next",
    "slide",
    "this is hospitalization by age group",
    "uh so you take each age group and",
    "what you look at is the percentage of",
    "those people who got",
    "covered uh who tested uh who tested",
    "positive those people who got coveted",
    "how many of them ended up",
    "in the hospital and so",
    "no real surprise one caution",
    "this is not 100 this is only up to 30",
    "so you know obviously the top groups",
    "that end up in the hospital or the older",
    "the older individuals but also note",
    "the most the youngest so most youngest",
    "five percent",
    "zero to four or five percent of them",
    "ended up in a hospital",
    "um you know up to 30 a little bit better",
    "than 30",
    "in the 80 to uh down to",
    "70. so again no no huge surprises",
    "sort of the things we've been saying but",
    "this is a ohio data",
    "and this tells you kind of what what we",
    "are seeing uh",
    "in ohio eric let's go to the uh county",
    "color update",
    "um and a lot of this is stabilized",
    "for good or bad 68 of our counties",
    "stayed the same level this week",
    "nine counties dropped from orange to",
    "yellow so more yellow counties we like",
    "that a lot",
    "uh great improvement lucas county wayne",
    "county dropped",
    "from red to orange again we're happy",
    "about that",
    "we have six red counties uh tier three",
    "uh that's down from seven last week this",
    "re this year this",
    "week's red counties uh butler",
    "mercer montgomery preble putnam and",
    "summit county",
    "two of these six counties mercer and",
    "preble",
    "only meet the cdc's threshold for high",
    "incidents",
    "but because they were already there they",
    "stay there we'll talk more about those",
    "in in just a moment let's talk now about",
    "the red",
    "counties let's start with putnam county",
    "uh putnam county is at a high level",
    "of cases uh 280 cases per 100 000",

    "county is seeing a sustained increase in",
    "new cases growing from an average of",
    "five cases per day on august 19th",
    "to an average of 11 cases on august 29th",
    "primary source of spread in putnam",
    "county is within families",
    "uh for example mom gets it and then",
    "comes home gives it to other family",
    "members or dad gets it or",
    "child gets it but it's within in",
    "families",
    "basically spread within the community",
    "let's go down to butler county uh butler",
    "county's numbers certainly are still",
    "being influenced by",
    "uh what's going on at miami university",
    "uh between september",
    "2nd and 20 and excuse me between",
    "september 2nd and 8th",
    "there were 545 student positive cases",
    "the previous week there are 495 cases",
    "these numbers are certainly impacting",
    "the county's sustained increase in new",
    "cases",
    "in addition to the miami university",
    "student cases there are small outbreaks",
    "at workplaces",
    "and long-term care facilities",
    "let's go up northwest ohio to mercer",

    "county for a couple weeks now we've seen",
    "it starting to go back",
    "up still a very high level mercer county",
    "continues to",
    "see spread throughout the community",
    "they've had",
    "outbreaks in workplaces they've had",
    "long-term care facilities and they've",
    "got",
    "just pretty much spread throughout the",
    "county",
    "montgomery county one of our",
    "more urban counties while during the",
    "total two-week reporting period",
    "montgomery county had a sustained",
    "increase",
    "in new cases the county is seeing a",
    "decline",
    "in cases during the most recent week of",
    "reporting remember we go",

    "we're seeing a lowering of cases coming",
    "out of the university of dayton",
    "during the past three days they only had",
    "31 cases",
    "they have a total of 962 total recovered",
    "cases so",
    "962 recovered ud has shifted their",
    "classes",
    "to remote through september 14th",
    "to slow the spread in this new",
    "university of dayton student cases there",
    "continues to be small workplace",
    "spread and long-term care facility",
    "outbreaks as well",
    "over west they're there to prevail",
    "county",
    "their case number is 105 so if they can",
    "get below 105",
    "for a two-week period we hope that next",
    "next week they will drop below the red",
    "parable county's cases have decreased",
    "during the past three",
    "weeks from an average of 146 cases cases",
    "to 122. the county is ending the past",
    "two weeks an",
    "average of 105 cases",
    "the county continues on this trajectory",
    "it should drop from red to orange next",
    "week so again",
    "most important part they're moving the",
    "right direction",
    "uh and we hope that preble can get that",
    "below 100 and",
    "move off off the red summit county",
    "seeing a sustained increase sadly in",
    "emergency department visits for",
    "covet-like illness",
    "that is an early warning sign on august",
    "20th the county had an average of five",
    "visits per day to the emergency",

    "county also seen a sustained increase in",
    "hospitalizations",
    "admission numbers have increased from",
    "two admissions",
    "on august 22nd to seven on august 29th",
    "outbreaks have been associated with",
    "workplaces and a fraternal club",
    "i want to take a minute and talk about",
    "the fraternal club",
    "outbreak we're not certainly not going",
    "to identify it but",
    "like many of the clubs that are found",
    "throughout our state",
    "a non-profit has a restaurant has a bar",
    "in this case two people visit the club",
    "while they were contagious",
    "since then employees other members and",
    "family members",
    "uh got the virus no no indication",
    "obviously",
    "these people who came at knew that they",
    "were contagious",
    "people don't most the time know that",
    "it's at least a lot of the time they",
    "don't know that so",
    "again two people came they visited um",
    "and then we saw uh other",
    "other members and family members get the",
    "virus total 12 people tested positive",
    "only one of the people had was",
    "with symptoms the cases range in",
    "age from 29 to 81",
    "and four people have been hospitalized",
    "who are seriously ill",
    "look we don't share these stories to",
    "make people feel bad",
    "this is just a horrible horrible",
    "situation",
    "i don't think anyone wanted to make",
    "anyone sick",
    "none of us want to make anyone sick but",
    "the story just illustrates how this can",
    "happen",
    "in what would appear to be a very a",
    "benign friendly",
    "situation uh so we just ask people to",
    "wear masks keep the social distance and",
    "do all the things that",
    "uh everyone talks about in the in the",
    "health community",
    "um let's go eric to our",
    "top 10 counties again what this",
    "what this represents and this is the top",
    "this is the top ten",
    "uh you can see on our web page the top",
    "88 we'll stay eric just with the top ten",
    "um these are counties that",
    "no matter what their color uh meet the",
    "cdc's threshold of height what they call",
    "high incidence which means over a",
    "hundred",
    "cases per hundred thousand over a two",
    "week period of time",
    "a county is flagged as high incidence",
    "when has more than 100 cases per hundred",
    "thousand residents over the past two",
    "weeks",
    "uh cdc uses this as a definition of high",
    "incidence",
    "um why do we worry about these counties",
    "well it means that cases are rising",
    "steadily in a county",
    "uh even if that county doesn't meet one",
    "of our under other indicators they have",
    "a significant number of cases",
    "having a large number of cases can lead",
    "to rapid virus transmission throughout",
    "the county if steps aren't taken too",
    "slow the spread",
    "four new count four counties moved to a",
    "high incidence list this week",
    "and i want to talk briefly about them",
    "first is clark county",
    "springfield area wittenberg university",
    "located in springfield is certainly",
    "contributing to the increased number of",
    "cases",
    "uh and again we see this uh throughout",
    "the state with colleges as",
    "students are coming back university is",
    "reporting on its dashboard so anybody",
    "can go look at that",
    "the cases have increased to more than 70",
    "this week these cases are being",
    "associated with",
    "out-of-class social gatherings and again",
    "that's a common theme as we've seen in",
    "in our schools to help combat to the",
    "spread the university announced on",
    "september 9th",
    "the classes will be remote for two weeks",
    "after several weeks of being below the",
    "high incident threshold hamilton county",
    "is back on the list barely but they are",
    "back 103 cases per hundred thousand",
    "the county has seen small outbreaks in",
    "high school college and workplace",
    "settings along with other",
    "sources of community spread the",
    "university of cincinnati is reporting",
    "143 cases",
    "in the past 15 days which does",
    "contribute to that",
    "in late august miami county",
    "had some small workplace and church",
    "outbreaks this week a nursing home",
    "outbreak was identified",
    "and already has more than a dozen cases",
    "there",
    "miami county is 117 per 100 000",
    "residents in the last two weeks and then",
    "we'll go up",
    "northwest ohio again clear up to wood",
    "county",
    "during the past two weeks they've had",
    "144 positive cases",
    "bowling green state university has a",
    "newly developed cova dashboard so you",
    "can take a look at that",
    "that reports that bowling green had 62",
    "cases bowling green state university 62",
    "cases from september 1 to september 8th",
    "and that's the numbers speaking of",
    "wittenberg",
    "we're going to ask the president of",
    "wittenberg to come on here",
    "dr franson um doctor thank you very very",
    "much for",
    "uh joining us uh you have a a beautiful",
    "lovely campus",
    "and uh with with great students and",
    "faculty and uh",
    "we want to just kind of find out how",
    "things are going for you",
    "and what what you're seeing and and how",
    "you're dealing with everything",
    "well thank you very much governor for uh",
    "giving me a chance to share our story",
    "as the governor indicated our dashboard",
    "is available",
    "at our website uh wittenberg dot edu",
    "slash together is where our covet",
    "information is and",
    "and together is really the description",
    "of",
    "how we've approached this as a community",
    "how we plan to bring students back to",
    "campus",
    "and the fact that we've just had great",
    "cooperation in springfield",
    "from the clark county combined health",
    "district and mercy hospital both",
    "we saw our case numbers increase from",
    "two one of which was resolved last",
    "monday",
    "to 22. and we're doing our own contact",
    "tracing",
    "uh we're finding that because of our",
    "tight-knit community",
    "our staff who are doing the contact",
    "tracing can",
    "can quickly make connections and and get",
    "students to talk to them because they're",
    "comfortable",
    "and familiar and we have a daily meeting",
    "with our",
    "combined health district and the",
    "physicians that have been advising us",
    "and one of the things that that really",
    "worried uh the health district in",
    "particular",
    "was they were finding from our reporting",
    "uh",
    "contact close contacts of 10 to 15",
    "per case whereas typically they find two",
    "to three co",
    "close contacts per case so you know",
    "concerned about that",
    "we have been doing uh symptomatic",
    "testing and",
    "we're only able to start doing any",
    "asymptomatic testing",
    "middle of last week with mercy and to",
    "get a handle on",
    "on how our community was really doing we",
    "we wanted to pause the in-person",
    "instruction",
    "and have an opportunity to test a larger",
    "swath of our community",
    "so we could really get a better picture",
    "and fortunately",
    "with help from the local health district",
    "your office governor",
    "we had a testing event on campus",
    "yesterday and",
    "uh hopefully by the end of the week",
    "we're going to have a better sense of",
    "where we really are",
    "well it's interesting uh mr president",
    "that you're doing",
    "your own tracing that sounds like it's",
    "working pretty well",
    "and also interesting",
    "i wonder if you could talk a little bit",
    "more about the contacts because",
    "when and maybe explain how that tracing",
    "is done so that anybody who's watching",
    "this doesn't",
    "maybe understand the contacts uh but",
    "you know it it is interesting uh it's a",
    "pretty high number",
    "uh of contacts per per student so",
    "if you can kind of run through that a",
    "little bit sure so uh",
    "our contact tracing is being done by our",
    "staff our our athletic trainers in",
    "particular have really stepped up to be",
    "involved in that",
    "um their their workload's a little",
    "quieter right now because we don't have",
    "uh intercollegiate athletics going on",
    "and we have a lot of athletes who they",
    "know and so you know we've",
    "activated them gotten them trained to do",
    "that contact tracing",
    "and you know they're they're very busy",
    "um and what we're finding with the the",
    "context they're reaching out to",
    "um again it's it's social circles as the",
    "the governor said it's not spread that's",
    "happening in the classroom",
    "it's not spread that's happening in the",
    "dining hall",
    "it's really the residence units and",
    "uh social gatherings that are are",
    "driving",
    "our challenges um we have about 60",
    "houses",
    "adjacent to campus that anywhere from",
    "three to five students live in",
    "and so we're fortunate in that you know",
    "we aren't seeing",
    "spread in our dormitories um we're",
    "seeing the spread in those residential",
    "housing units",
    "uh neighbors to neighbors",
    "block to block um but not so much in our",
    "our residence halls so",
    "we've been able to quarantine people uh",
    "on a smaller scale than we might if it",
    "were in our dorms",
    "and what's the plans going forward",
    "doctor you've kind of paused",
    "you're going remote at this point i",
    "think you said right so we're",
    "we're in a two-week pause with in-person",
    "instruction we asked",
    "students to stay on campus um as advised",
    "by",
    "by your office and uh dr fauci",
    "i wish i could say all of them did some",
    "of them went home",
    "but the majority of them are here with",
    "us",
    "we're continuing to offer support",
    "services to students",
    "we again we've got great support from",
    "the local health district in terms of",
    "taking care of our",
    "our cases and we're up to 76 active",
    "cases as of today",
    "um taking care of those students are who",
    "are in quarantine making sure they get",
    "meals",
    "uh making sure we're checking up on them",
    "and you know again the test results from",
    "this broader testing are really going to",
    "going to help us see if if the work we",
    "were doing",
    "had captured the majority of activity on",
    "our campus then great",
    "but if the tests show that even with",
    "those efforts we were missing a lot of",
    "what was going on on campus",
    "we'll have to to rethink just how long",
    "we paused the in-person instruction",
    "we had one of your students on a skype",
    "yesterday uh chancellor gardner and i",
    "did and we had students from actually",
    "all over the state",
    "and one one of the students uh made a",
    "kind of interesting",
    "point uh the students said you know",
    "what's important is there still be stuff",
    "to do on campus because if",
    "university is not sponsoring things to",
    "do on campus that",
    "is in fact safe the student's",
    "perspective was",
    "people will go off and do the sort of do",
    "their own thing so that's a",
    "you got to you got a tough balance there",
    "you know you want to keep the",
    "social distance and keep people wearing",
    "masks but it was a",
    "it was interesting i hadn't really",
    "thought about that and i don't know if",
    "you",
    "have any reaction to that uh or or or",
    "not but it was",
    "i found to be an interesting comment yep",
    "and and you know we recognized that",
    "uh from last spring that engagement was",
    "going to be really important and",
    "last spring as we went to all remote",
    "instruction",
    "you know staying engaged with our",
    "students virtually and and otherwise",
    "keeping faculty and staff engaged and as",
    "we brought students back to campus this",
    "fall",
    "you know having opportunities for them",
    "to engage",
    "that were structured and safe uh was",
    "really important to us",
    "and you know we've had a couple of",
    "pornhole tournaments which are uh you",
    "know good way to get people together but",
    "keep them",
    "distanced we've had",
    "some uh car races we brought in a",
    "company that that",
    "did car races on the uh the main uh",
    "uh quad in our on our campus um",
    "and we've tried to to do what we can to",
    "create",
    "structured activities safe activities we",
    "also have uh have had a bunch",
    "of uh pickup and take-home",
    "craft projects that seem to be a hit",
    "with students and we've",
    "just this week had a pick up and take",
    "home cooking project",
    "our students who are in those houses",
    "have their own kitchens",
    "and so you know we're doing uh what we",
    "can",
    "we can't do that 24 7. we have to rely",
    "on the students",
    "to mask up what we say at wittenberg is",
    "stay a tiger apart",
    "tiger's a little bit bigger than six",
    "feet so we we ask him to stay a tiger",
    "apart",
    "and you know practice good hygiene and",
    "and really limit gatherings and you know",
    "what we're hearing from",
    "the health district is the distancing",
    "and masking and duration",
    "of whatever contact they have are just",
    "so important",
    "and you know i think we're going to",
    "redouble the efforts to make sure",
    "students understand that i think they've",
    "learned a lot about how important that",
    "is just from our experience over the",
    "last 10 days",
    "dr franson thank you and good luck to",
    "you and students at wittenberg and the",
    "faculty",
    "and and all your team and uh i've said",
    "this before",
    "but uh when you see a university or",
    "college uh that is reporting cases",
    "um it really means that they're doing",
    "something right they're on it",
    "uh they're trying they're trying to do",
    "the tracing uh they're doing the testing",
    "and they're doing what they need to do",
    "and the same is true had the opportunity",
    "to talk to the superintendent",
    "in in lima uh yesterday um",
    "and uh k through 12. and um you know",
    "it's just good to talk to some of the",
    "superintendents because uh",
    "you know they're on it and um you know",
    "as dr franson said what i think we're",
    "finding both in k-12",
    "uh and in our colleges is that the",
    "classroom",
    "while there certainly can always be",
    "spread we're not saying there can't be",
    "but that's usually a pretty safe place",
    "and what we're seeing is",
    "either spread out into the community uh",
    "or in the case with college students",
    "them doing something",
    "um you know that's that's it's not in",
    "the dorm it's not in",
    "not in the class but uh so those are",

    "prevent suicide so",
    "just quickly um you know these are",
    "really stressful times",
    "and people are are definitely feeling it",
    "and the message we want people to know",
    "is it is okay to not feel okay",
    "but you also don't have to feel alone i",
    "know you talked the other day about some",
    "some things that all of us can do to",

    "for a socially distanced",
    "meal together a handwritten card those",
    "are things",
    "all of us can be doing to take care of",

    "know and understand the risk",
    "factors and the signs of suicide so on",
    "this",
    "world suicide prevention today really",
    "want to highlight that",
    "if if you have a loved one a friend who",
    "is",
    "talking about feeling hopeless or",
    "like they're a burden to others or they",
    "really don't have a reason to live",
    "that's something to pay close attention",
    "to if you see",
    "them using drugs or alcohol",
    "and taking real risks and and having",
    "risky behaviors like driving",
    "in risky ways or drinking to",
    "intoxication",
    "those are things that acting recklessly",
    "visiting or calling people to say",
    "goodbye",
    "or giving away prized possessions",
    "to people those are all signs that",
    "someone might be thinking",
    "about suicide and then also just",
    "withdrawing from family and friends",
    "disconnecting not spending that time",
    "that they normally would interacting",
    "with people",
    "it can be uncomfortable to talk to",
    "someone about suicide",
    "or to talk about mental health in",
    "general and that's normal but just",
    "remember",
    "talking about mental health doesn't have",
    "to be a big deal you can",
    "just ask how someone's feeling and be a",
    "good listener",
    "talking about suicide does not mean that",
    "you're putting the idea of suicide in",
    "someone's mind it doesn't make them",
    "think about it",
    "if they already weren't and so just",
    "talking about it",
    "making it a conversation that's safe to",
    "have is a good thing to do",
    "and also remembering that suicidal",
    "feelings are temporary and so having",
    "that conversation",
    "checking in on someone is an important",
    "way that we can each",
    "take a step to save a life remind the",
    "person they're not alone",
    "and know that you're not alone either",
    "there are ways that all of us can",
    "connect to professionals for advice",
    "and for help and for counseling and for",
    "crisis support",
    "so just a couple of quick ways that we",
    "can do that as ohioans",
    "first we have the crisis text line so",
    "you can see that up here it's",
    "text the number four and the word hope",
    "to 741",
    "741 and within minutes you can start a",
    "text conversation",
    "with a professional counselor who will",
    "help",
    "walk through some of the emotional",
    "distress you're feeling and help connect",
    "you",
    "to the information or support that you",
    "need",
    "you can also call the ohio care line",
    "this is something that we started in",
    "april",
    "it's a person on the other end of the",
    "phone 24 hours a day",
    "seven days a week and it gives every",
    "ohioan a free",
    "confidential way to just reach out and",
    "get questions answered ask for help",
    "we've already had nearly 2500 ohioans",
    "use this care line",
    "about 50 percent of them have gotten",
    "information",
    "or referral to support in their local",
    "communities about 30 percent of them",
    "have actually had a brief counseling",
    "opportunity while they were on the phone",
    "less than 10 minutes but just some",
    "advice",
    "and some opportunity to to ease that",
    "emotional distress",
    "and nearly 150 ohioans use this line as",
    "a way to get connected to crisis",
    "services",
    "because they uh were really seeking that",
    "out when they made that call",
    "so we want you to use this the number is",
    "1-800-720-9616 and again it's free",
    "it's confidential it's 24 hours a day",
    "for any ohioan any age to call and ask",
    "for help",
    "suicide is something that occurs at",
    "every age for ohioans men are four times",
    "more likely to attempt or complete a",
    "suicide and that's men of all ages so",
    "really thinking 35 and older even older",
    "adults",
    "so pay attention to one another and",
    "ask how people are doing reach out for",
    "help and connect to these resources",
    "suicide is preventable there's hope",
    "and together we can prevent suicides in",
    "ohio",
    "director thank you thank you very much",
    "very very helpful",
    "appreciate it thanks for good work and",
    "your department's work",
    "uh we'll go now to questions",
    "first question today is from jeff",
    "freddick at wsyx in columbus",
    "good afternoon governor jeff",
    "the data for franklin county is",
    "interesting today the cases as you know",
    "continue to march",
    "very upward now over 158 per 100 000",
    "at the same time hospitalizations",
    "continue to go down",
    "deaths continue to go down that's even",
    "as we're",
    "poised to hit a higher peak than we've",
    "ever hit here in franklin county and in",
    "columbus so",
    "at some point knowing that young people",
    "are driving this",
    "does anything become more targeted based",
    "on age group rather than",
    "mass orders for everyone you know",
    "restrictions for every restaurant",
    "do we do we have a realization that",
    "young people are driving this and",
    "they're just not getting as sick",
    "well i think that's that's true it's",
    "particularly uh true in a",
    "county that's a young county uh",
    "based on population uh it's a city uh",
    "columbus is a young city",
    "um you know obviously driven by our",
    "universities",
    "um so that should not surprise the",
    "numbers i showed up here were statewide",
    "numbers but",
    "as you could see uh you know huge number",
    "uh between 0 and 30",
    "but you know big big number between 18",
    "and and",
    "and 30. uh so no that it should not",
    "surprise us that you know the",
    "the concern uh we have a lot of concerns",
    "um you know it's like it's not as if",
    "a young people young person can't get",
    "sick",
    "you know we saw some hospitalization",
    "numbers up there",
    "so people can get sick at any age they",
    "can end up going to the hospital",
    "they certainly it's less uh when you're",
    "18 or",
    "20. but we've also had examples of",
    "people get very very very sick",
    "the second point though is the spread",
    "and this is why when we look at our",
    "colleges and universities and it's why",
    "the white house",
    "uh experts are saying you know once you",
    "start back in college don't send the",
    "students home",
    "uh because all you're doing is then you",
    "know taking that spread and",
    "sending it out to whoever they they came",
    "from and you may hit other vulnerable",
    "populations so i think",
    "you know a big concern is other",
    "vulnerable populations",
    "uh and that 20 year old can have it and",
    "maybe not have uh",
    "you know not have any symptoms but then",
    "somebody else gets it",
    "uh from from them so it's kind of the",
    "rebound effect",
    "uh i made that up but it's you know sort",
    "of a",
    "bounce off effect uh and that's you know",
    "really what you're concerned about",
    "um you know your question is can you",
    "target this group anymore yeah i mean",
    "that's the question that we ask",
    "ourselves and we're looking for",
    "you know we're looking looking for ideas",
    "and certainly ways to do that",
    "next question is from jackie borchardt",
    "at the cincinnati enquirer",
    "good afternoon governor experts keep",
    "saying that if we really want to slow",
    "down the spread we need to be able to",
    "test frequently and quickly",
    "it's been more than a month since that",
    "six state compact to acquire antigen",
    "tests was announced",
    "i know the feds are sending antigen",
    "tests in nursing homes and assisted",
    "living centers",
    "is ohio moving forward to acquire",
    "antigen tests",
    "and use them what is the plan at this",
    "point",
    "well we're exploring a lot of different",
    "things",
    "uh i can give you next time a full",
    "report of all the different things that",
    "that are uh we are looking at and the",
    "process",
    "that we're in as you know one of the big",
    "announcements was from the white house",
    "uh a huge number uh you know we're gonna",
    "find out in the next couple days we",
    "think",
    "when all those are coming uh those are",
    "those are",
    "quicker tests uh less invasive tests and",
    "you know we're gonna make decisions",
    "about where to deploy those",
    "um you know when you look at uh you know",
    "where to deploy them you look at your",
    "your most vulnerable populations uh",
    "first of all where your deaths are",
    "occurring",
    "or where you know the majority of deaths",
    "are occurring you look at nursing homes",
    "other congregate care",
    "settings um you'd also look at your",
    "universities you'd look at",
    "schools so um you know all those things",
    "are coming but i will come out i will on",
    "tuesday",
    "going to give you a a report we may have",
    "one of our",
    "testing experts that we have kind of",
    "walk everybody through",
    "exactly jackie where we are with all the",
    "different",
    "all the different testing i was on the",
    "phone with our testing team",
    "team this morning i'm on the phone with",
    "them uh about every day but",
    "they're better able to give you a more",
    "precise and accurate where we are with",

    "so we'll do that we'll try to do that on",
    "tuesday thanks do you have an update",
    "from my tuesday question about the",
    "school order what was the question",
    "well the order uh makes it optional for",
    "schools to",
    "do any sort of public reporting like a",
    "dashboard you mentioned the college",
    "dashboard several times today",
    "and how useful they are but in the state",
    "health order for",
    "k-12 schools that is uh something they",
    "are encouraged to do",
    "but not required to do so why my",
    "question from tuesday was",
    "why not make that a requirement yeah i",
    "mean i look i've talked to",
    "superintendents uh in the last several",
    "days who are concerned that we're",
    "disclosing too much",
    "information uh and then it might be too",
    "burdensome so we're trying to get we're",
    "trying to get a sweet spot there",
    "i think it's great when schools set up",
    "a place where anybody can go at any time",
    "and look and see",
    "you know what exactly is going on in",
    "that school",
    "but we're trying to get this right we",
    "think we've got the right order but",
    "frankly",
    "we're going to see how this works out",
    "we're going to wait another few days and",
    "re-evaluate it until we",
    "as i said we have some people say well",
    "you know you're putting out too much",
    "information some people said",
    "you know it's too burdensome to put all",
    "this information out what we thought was",
    "the most important thing is that",
    "if you have a child in that school and",
    "that child came in contact with the",
    "person who",
    "has coveted you need to know that",
    "obviously the normal",
    "tracing the health department needs to",
    "know that that report needs to be made",
    "we think it's also important that that",
    "school disclose",
    "uh if there is covet in that in in in",
    "that building",
    "and if there's covet in that in that",
    "school system so you know",
    "they are to make those disclosures",
    "um some of them have decided to do it",
    "uh through a dashboard and again that we",
    "think is a",
    "is a pretty good way to do it so",
    "we're in a trial period we're gonna see",
    "how this works we're gonna see if",
    "you know information is flowing but",
    "again",
    "i know that in the news media you want",
    "to get all this and i fully understand",
    "that",
    "uh most important people that get it are",
    "the parents and the parents who have",
    "kids in that school",
    "and our order make sure that the parents",
    "who have kids in that school",
    "know about that and know what's know",
    "what's going on",
    "one thing that's been expressed to me is",
    "look it makes our school look bad",
    "and let me just say again schools that",
    "are reporting",
    "covet uh should not be considered",
    "as being bad schools or not doing their",
    "job",
    "it means they are doing their job",
    "they're finding the cova they're",
    "reporting it",
    "uh they're tracing they're turning it",
    "over to the health department they're",
    "doing what needs to be done",
    "that's true with our colleges and that's",
    "true with k-12 as well",
    "thank you next question is from jack",
    "windsor at wmfd in mansfield",
    "governor hello uh first thank you for",
    "taking the time today to distinguish the",
    "difference between",
    "deaths reported and actual deaths that",
    "occurred in the past 24 hours as well as",
    "the scale on the graph regarding",
    "hospitalizations by age we've already",
    "received a lot of messages and our",
    "viewers appreciate that so thank you",
    "um governor my question is regarding the",
    "new york times article",
    "i think you've heard about this before",
    "it published on august 29th and it",
    "referenced",
    "testing data gathered from massachusetts",
    "new york and nevada",
    "that found up to 90 of positive tests",
    "are picking up",
    "dead virus fragments that the cdc says",
    "could be up to 12 weeks old",
    "that would mean that instead of maybe 15",
    "to 20 000 active cases in ohio we may",
    "actually be around",
    "say 1500 to 2 2000 do you have plans or",
    "should we have",
    "plans to start tracking viral load data",
    "as a better determinant and is it",
    "possible that we might otherwise be",
    "quarantining thousands",
    "of ohioans and college students based on",
    "the older science and testing",
    "and then a follow-up where are we with",
    "the antibody testing study dr",
    "acton promised back in april thank you",
    "yeah the antibody test i'll let john",
    "talk about that because",
    "uh he's he has looked at that uh we got",
    "preliminary results back we've not",
    "gotten uh final results back yet so when",
    "we get the final we will",
    "we will certainly uh certainly uh",
    "release those uh",
    "jack interesting question um i don't",
    "know about the",
    "new york times story in those uh those",
    "states",
    "but um you know",
    "if you had perfectly precise measurement",
    "uh you might be able to and again i'll",
    "leave it up to the doctors but you",
    "you would have a better idea of exactly",
    "when someone",
    "is contagious um",
    "you know the the pcr and i think i said",
    "this on",
    "tuesday pcr test is is",
    "is very accurate but you know it may be",
    "still picking up",
    "the viral you know well after that",
    "person is",
    "contagious and so as we get more tests",
    "and we get the better ability to",
    "to do that you know what everyone would",
    "love to have",
    "is knowing exactly when that person is",
    "contagious",
    "and if there's a way to know when",
    "exactly they're no longer contagious and",
    "that way you could confine them or",
    "or separate them from people only during",
    "during that during that period",
    "that period of time but i've asked my",
    "team and we can talk about it on tuesday",
    "i've asked my team to come up with",
    "you know exactly where the state of the",
    "art is uh",
    "in trying to get that in trying to get",
    "that viral that viral load",
    "next question is from max philby at the",
    "columbus dispatch",
    "hey governor um given",
    "that the symptoms of the flu in covid19",
    "can sometimes be pretty similar um i",
    "suppose if more people",
    "get the flu vaccine this year will that",
    "in any way help us avoid some of the",
    "lockdowns that we had to go through",
    "earlier this year you think",
    "well i i think that's a good it's look",
    "it's a good point i mean it's going to",
    "enable",
    "um you know again i'm not the doctor",
    "but you know we know a couple things",
    "uh or i've been told a couple of things",
    "one",
    "you don't want to have the flu and covet",
    "i mean you don't want to have either one",
    "but you certainly do not want to have",
    "them",
    "excuse me both the same time uh",
    "and the other thing is we know that what",
    "these shots do that fran i just got and",
    "john got",
    "uh you know you may still get it but you",
    "don't get it",
    "with as bad as symptoms um so",
    "the other thing that's going on and we",
    "don't know how it's going to play out",
    "but it's",
    "you know it's it's it's something to",
    "wonder about",
    "uh is there have been some countries in",
    "in the southern hemisphere",
    "uh that have not had as bad a flu season",
    "uh and that is attributed at least in",
    "the articles i read to",
    "people wearing mass and because the good",
    "news is and we actually",
    "dr acting and i started talking about",
    "this early early on six months ago",
    "but the good news is what you do to",
    "protect yourself from flu is very",
    "similar to what you would do to protect",
    "yourself with covet",
    "so it's not a new message it's not a new",
    "drill uh you know",
    "by and so you know what happened they",
    "think in this",
    "southern hemisphere is it was a much",
    "milder flu season",
    "uh because people were wearing masks and",
    "were doing",
    "all the all the things the washing of",
    "the hands etc so",
    "um it's a positive thing to get the flu",
    "shot",
    "you know and i think there's a number of",
    "reasons why",
    "next question is from jake zuckerman at",
    "the ohio capitol journal",
    "hi governor in interviews in february",
    "and march",
    "with bob woodward of the washington post",
    "president donald trump",
    "uh talked about how deadly the",
    "coronavirus is and called it more",
    "deadly than the flu he said in these",
    "interviews",
    "i wanted to i wanted to always play it",
    "down i still like playing it down",
    "because i don't want to create a panic",
    "and in public he referred to the virus",
    "as a democrat hoax",
    "said it would go away on its own and",
    "compared it to the flu",
    "do you believe the president misled the",
    "public about the gravity of",
    "public of coven 19 well first of all",
    "look bob woodward is a respected",
    "journalist",
    "um uh you know has great great",
    "uh credibility um",
    "all i can do is is you know talk about",
    "our communication",
    "with the white house and uh you know",
    "what what they were doing uh the",
    "president made decisions",
    "or some decisions early on um",
    "to you know stop travel uh for for",
    "example um",
    "so um you know those were decisions that",
    "that he made um all i know is what",
    "i saw on tv last night in the brief time",
    "i was watching uh",
    "president said you know he did not want",
    "to alarm people",
    "so i'm going to take the president uh at",
    "face value",
    "uh look our our relationships",
    "what we do every week um with the white",
    "house we had a call",
    "yesterday uh usually the vice president",
    "is on the call",
    "sometimes the president is on the call",
    "uh and if you could see those or you",
    "could listen to those",
    "um they're very very business like no",
    "nonsense",
    "uh straightforward let's get the job",
    "done uh that has been my",
    "um relationship with this administration",
    "uh when we've asked them when i called",
    "the president on a sunday morning",
    "he called me back and said you know can",
    "we move forward on this",
    "a little quicker but whatever we've",
    "asked them to do they have tried to do",
    "they haven't been able to do everything",
    "uh but they have tried to do and they've",
    "taken this",
    "uh very very seriously uh you know all",
    "the way through",
    "and so that's been my personal",
    "relationship or my personal experience",
    "you know that i have had",
    "next question is from alex ebert at",
    "bloomberg",
    "good afternoon governor thanks for",
    "having us following up on that last",
    "question",
    "the governor to the north in a state i",
    "will not name",
    "said today during a press conference",
    "that the greatest threat to america",
    "is actually the disinformation that",
    "president trump has given to the",
    "american people",
    "about the virus since february in those",
    "interviews",
    "like the previous questionnaire um posed",
    "he indicates that he is downplaying the",
    "viruses potential",
    "he's called it a fraud he's called it a",
    "hoax since then",
    "how has that impacted the people of ohio",
    "thank you",
    "well look i'll let people make their own",
    "judgment on that my focus has been on",
    "ohio",
    "um you know i have been uh",
    "i've been accused of uh uh you know",
    "gloom and doom and uh",
    "and and and too many facts and too much",
    "uh",
    "uh uh you know i've been accused as an",
    "alarmist",
    "so look i mean you just have to call it",
    "like you see it uh",
    "i've tried to call it like i see it uh",
    "in ohio i tried to keep ohioans informed",
    "of what we know uh you know we continue",
    "to learn from the virus",
    "and i think we should we should keep",
    "that in mind uh you know hindsight is",
    "always great",
    "whether whoever whatever governor you're",
    "looking at or whatever",
    "president you're looking at you know",
    "hindsight is great",
    "uh but this virus continues to evolve",
    "and the understanding continues to",
    "evolve",
    "i mean this has been pointed out to me",
    "many many times but it's true",
    "early on if you talk to the cdc and the",
    "experts you know they would tell us",
    "something about that mask",
    "well you know don't wear a mask",
    "you know well it's abundantly clear now",
    "after doing this for six months and",
    "after you know some research being done",
    "and observations and cases followed that",
    "masks are huge",
    "and so you know what we have tried to do",
    "what i've tried to do",
    "is your governor uh is to",
    "give you the facts as i know them um",
    "and but you know hindsight is always",
    "great",
    "if we knew what we know today when the",
    "when this whole thing started uh you",
    "know we would have done things different",
    "probably in ohio too",
    "uh but but we we did not so we're trying",
    "to",
    "call it like we see it we're going to",
    "continue to do that and sometimes people",
    "don't like it but",
    "you know i think that's what i owe the",
    "people of ohio",
    "governor i just wanted to respond on",
    "on the antibody testing the promise has",
    "always been that it would be here",
    "sometime by the",
    "final report would be issued by the",
    "middle of september we're still on track",
    "with that",
    "so maybe by next thursday or the",

    "except for adult day cares and longer",
    "term senior centers especially",
    "if they have to do covent testing for",

    "outline exactly how we",
    "we hope to do this um you know we we",
    "realize that our senior centers are very",
    "uh very very important uh but we also",
    "realize that we",
    "this virus has not gone away and so we",
    "have to have people who can keep their",
    "distance our senior senators",
    "many of them have still been supplying",
    "services",
    "uh the services just have been cut down",
    "or they've been you know out away from",
    "the from the building itself and you've",
    "seen a lot fewer people who have been",
    "able to",
    "to actually come into the to the senior",
    "centers but this is important for mental",
    "health uh it's important for",
    "for many many reasons and i'll have",
    "director mcelroy",
    "uh skype in uh next week and she can",
    "kind of lay out exactly where",
    "where we are and where we think we're",
    "going it would be an appropriate time to",
    "do that",
    "next question is from justin dennis at",
    "mahoningmatters.com",
    "afternoon governor we've heard from some",
    "local officials who say they must",
    "decide how to use state disbursed karzai",
    "funding",
    "by october 6 and they feel that's not",
    "enough time",
    "they also said the state was slow to",
    "disperse its karzak funding to",
    "localities",
    "you feel the state has given localities",
    "enough time to work with this funding",
    "and can you",
    "explain kind of what's happening behind",
    "the scenes in the states process for",
    "dispersing those funds and also when can",
    "localities",
    "expect the next disbursement and would",
    "it still carry that same october 6",
    "deadline",
    "sure sure there is a bill in the",
    "legislature",
    "it's passed one house we expect it to",
    "pass the other house",
    "uh that will get the additional money",
    "out we have taken the attitude uh",
    "in my administration that this money all",
    "of it should go out",
    "to the local communities and we have",
    "done that",
    "what they simply have to do is follow",
    "whatever the federal government tells",
    "them to do",
    "we have tried to obm to assist them in",
    "understanding",
    "what the federal requirements are and",
    "what the federal government is saying so",
    "these are",
    "these are my knowledge not our",
    "restrictions uh these are",
    "as they come down from from the federal",
    "government you know one of the messages",
    "that we've when we've talked to",
    "senator portman senator brown or members",
    "of the house",
    "is we've always asked for more",
    "flexibility and we've asked for more",
    "flexibility for the local communities",
    "to be able to you know make their own",
    "make their determination about how",
    "how this money should be spent so i",
    "don't know john do you have anything",
    "to add on that i know you've worked on",
    "that as well as i have",
    "john just left for another meeting okay",
    "so but that's that's what we're doing",
    "and uh you know we want to get this",
    "money out i i talk",
    "to the mayors quite often this week",
    "yesterday had long",
    "discussion with a large number of county",
    "commissioners today with mayors",
    "so we know they need the money",
    "we want to get get them money as soon as",
    "this bill passes the legislature",
    "i'll sign it the rest of the money goes",
    "out",
    "next question is from ben schwartz at",
    "wcpo",
    "in cincinnati hi ben hi governor",
    "i'm wondering if you're able to follow",
    "up about cincinnati police",
    "chief elliott isaac's request that you",
    "no longer impose the 10 pm closure for",
    "bars and restaurants",
    "i know you've now consulted with your",
    "lawyers and",
    "they've determined it's impossible to",
    "just carve cincinnati",
    "out of that order but do you plan to or",
    "is there a need to work with the city in",
    "any way further to find a solution to",
    "their problem",
    "sure that's a good excellent question",
    "ben",
    "you're right uh our lawyers tell us we",
    "cannot legally cut cincinnati out we",
    "would do that",
    "uh mayor's requested we do that if we",
    "could do that just for cincinnati we",
    "would",
    "do that we legally cannot do that the",
    "only other option is to",
    "change it for the whole state we have",
    "other mayors who are adamant and telling",
    "me",
    "please please don't do that",
    "so akron dayton columbus",
    "so we're not going to do that and",
    "but we're certainly very open to working",
    "with the mayor and with the chief if",
    "there's anything else that we can do",
    "one thing the legislature can do is to",
    "pass our bill",
    "that goes after violent repeat offenders",
    "goes after people who",
    "have no business having a gun who have",
    "no legal right to have a gun",
    "these are people who've been convicted",
    "of felonies and violent offenses before",
    "they have no right to have a gun we have",
    "a strong federal law in this area",
    "we have a fairly weak ohio law we need",
    "to get the ohio law",
    "up to where the federal law is now the",
    "u.s attorney will take",
    "some some of these cases these are cases",
    "where someone is picked up they've got a",
    "gun",
    "maybe they don't have not at that moment",
    "committing any other offense",
    "but they've got a gun and they're a",
    "convicted felon of a violent offense",
    "but the number of cases the u.s attorney",
    "can take are very limited",
    "uh and so they're going to take some and",
    "we appreciate them taking them",
    "but i want to empower local judges local",
    "prosecutors",
    "local police local sheriffs uh to be",
    "able to",
    "uh throw the book at the guy uh",
    "if he is in the community and he's got a",
    "gun and he's not supposed to have a gun",
    "what you find in these tragedies",
    "continue day after day and every week i",
    "i read some of the ones that have",
    "occurred to",
    "to everyone because it just is so",
    "maddening",
    "uh and you see little children who are",
    "shot almost inevitably",
    "almost inevitably the people who pulled",
    "the trigger",
    "did not have the right to have a gun we",
    "could have picked him up before",
    "they could be off the streets they could",
    "be locked up",
    "so i just asked the legislature please",
    "help us on this",
    "i don't know who's against this this",
    "protects the second amendment these",
    "people don't have a right to have a gun",
    "anyway",
    "so again we ask our friends in the",
    "legislature to take action this is",
    "something we can do",
    "and and we've we presented the bill and",
    "we would ask them to do that",
    "next question is from john reed at",
    "gangwar news service",
    "good afternoon governor um my question",
    "is",
    "we're seeing these spikes in college",
    "towns because of students coming back to",
    "campus",
    "how much of that is due to behavior of",
    "students or a higher prevalence of cases",
    "among students and how much is",
    "we're finally getting kind of a",
    "broad-based white population",
    "surveillance test and we're seeing a lot",
    "of people who are",
    "asymptomatic well i think it's both",
    "probably john um you know what we're",
    "seeing is",
    "human nature and people are getting",
    "together and college students are",
    "getting together and",
    "you know experience in college for for",
    "most people it's uh",
    "it's a uh you know get together and",
    "have a good time and uh you know",
    "socialize",
    "but um you know we we know that if",
    "people don't do that carefully",
    "um that that causes a significant spread",
    "so you have",
    "you know 10 000 15 000 sometimes",
    "students coming into a community uh that",
    "were not there a month ago",
    "and in some cases they're in a fairly",
    "concentrated area and they're",
    "intermixing with each other",
    "so you know it's it should not surprise",
    "any of us that this happens and",
    "and the burden that college presidents",
    "carry",
    "uh and that universities carry is to try",
    "to convince",
    "students look the only way you're gonna",
    "have a year on",
    "campus nine months on campus is if",
    "everyone",
    "you know tries to do what we need to do",
    "wear masks when you're out in public",
    "keep keep keep the distance",
    "you're also right i think that you know",
    "the schools that you're seeing the high",
    "numbers are schools that",
    "uh took it upon themselves and said hey",
    "we gotta go test",
    "uh if ohio state or university of dayton",
    "uh",
    "or if miami or wittenberg these four",
    "schools",
    "we just talked about recently if they",
    "weren't testing",
    "you probably wouldn't know much you know",
    "we wouldn't know uh",
    "that there are that many cases because",
    "you know that that age group",
    "many of them have no symptoms so i i",
    "think",
    "you're right on both both counts",
    "next question is from danny eldridge at",
    "hannah news service",
    "hello governor um so my question is what",
    "are your thoughts on the prospect",
    "of ohio state suing the big ten over uh",
    "football season being cancelled",
    "yeah i mean look i don't know it's gonna",
    "be up to the big ten when they vote",
    "i talked to gene smith athletic director",
    "this morning about it",
    "he gave me a little a little update i",
    "know ohio state wants to play",
    "i know the president wants to play and i",
    "think they make a good argument",
    "and the argument is that because they",
    "have the capability of testing",
    "very frequently uh and not just",
    "you know not just their football players",
    "but all the athletes",
    "and they're testing quite extensively on",
    "campus too with everybody",
    "but they're testing even more with with",
    "athletes because they have that ability",
    "um they know what they can know what's",
    "going on uh because",
    "there's a real incentive for athletes",
    "who want a season who want to",
    "want to play um and to",
    "avoid doing stupid things uh as",
    "as we all do uh and not wearing a mask",
    "and",
    "you know uh socializing uh in close",
    "proximity to each other with a lot of",
    "different people",
    "but there's real incentive for them not",
    "to do that to be careful uh",
    "so i think that you know you could look",
    "at these students uh these student",
    "athletes as being",
    "as safe as anybody on campus or maybe",
    "more so",
    "uh so i think there's a pretty good",
    "argument that",
    "you know it makes sense to to try to",
    "have that try to have that season",
    "next question is from andy chow at ohio",
    "public radio and television",
    "hi governor i wanted to talk more about",
    "the appointment of",

    "what things do you think might improve",
    "with a permanent director",
    "and are you at all worried about any",
    "sort of pushback from",

    "well all good questions what are my",
    "expectations",
    "high you know she's a she's a",

    "uh i think look lance himes as acting",
    "director has done a",
    "very very very good job uh i think it's",
    "always better to have a permanent",
    "director",
    "uh it's i think particularly good",
    "uh with this director with her deep",
    "knowledge her deep knowledge",
    "of um uh of public health uh her many",
    "many years",
    "experience in public health um and",

    "goal pose since we're talking about",
    "college football",
    "move the goal post further and further",
    "down the road they want to know",
    "when are you going to remove the",
    "remaining restrictions here is this tied",
    "to some kind of a positivity rate",
    "a number of cases new cases per capita",

    "the",
    "this is the question we're getting in",
    "the newsroom many times the anchor would",

    "um",
    "this is a fight we're in",
    "um we can't let the virus off the floor",

    "things as a price that we pay",
    "as ohioans for freedom",
    "so the freedom that we can go to work",
